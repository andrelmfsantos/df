As the speed of information growth exceeds Moore's Law at the beginning of this new century, excessive data is making great troubles to human beings. However, there are so much potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of data. A new scientific paradigm is born as data-intensive scientific discovery (DISD), also known as Big Data problems. A large number of fields and sectors, ranging from economic and business activities to public administration, from national security to scientific researches in many areas, involve with Big Data problems. On the one hand, Big Data is extremely valuable to produce productivity in businesses and evolutionary breakthroughs in scientific disciplines, which give us a lot of opportunities to make great progresses in many fields. There is no doubt that the future competitions in business productivity and technologies will surely converge into the Big Data explorations. On the other hand, Big Data also arises with many challenges, such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a close-up view about Big Data, including Big Data applications, Big Data opportunities and challenges, as well as the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies we currently adopt to deal with the Big Data problems. We also discuss several underlying methodologies to handle the data deluge, for example, granular computing, cloud computing, bio-inspired computing, and quantum computing. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Today there are many workflow systems, often with overlapping functionality. A key issue for potential users of workflow systems is the need to be able to compare the capabilities of the various available tools. There can be confusion about system functionality and the tools are often selected without a proper functional analysis. In this paper we extract a taxonomy of features from the way scientists make use of existing workflow systems and we illustrate this feature set by providing some examples taken from existing workflow systems. The taxonomy provides end users with a mechanism by which they can assess the suitability of workflow in general and how they might use these features to make an informed choice about which workflow system would be a good choice for their particular application.

Knowledge of their effects on the protein's 3D structure provides insight into the protein's mechanism, can aid the design of further experiments, and eventually can lead to the development of new medicines and diagnostic tools.Results: In this article we describe HOPE, a fully automatic program that analyzes the structural and functional effects of point mutations. HOPE collects information from a wide range of information sources including calculations on the 3D coordinates of the protein by using WHAT IF Web services, sequence annotations from the UniProt database, and predictions by DAS services. Homology models are built with YASARA. Data is stored in a database and used in a decision scheme to identify the effects of a mutation on the protein's 3D structure and function. HOPE builds a report with text, figures, and animations that is easy to use and understandable for (bio)medical researchers.Conclusions: We tested HOPE by comparing its output to the results of manually performed projects. In all straightforward cases HOPE performed similar to a trained bioinformatician. The use of 3D structures helps optimize the results in terms of reliability and details. HOPE's results are easy to understand and are presented in a way that is attractive for researchers without an extensive bioinformatics background. © 2010 Venselaar et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"3D coordinates; Automatic programs; Homology models; Information sources; Life scientists; Point mutations; Protein coding regions; Protein structure analysis; Bioinformatics; Diagnosis; Three dimensional; Web services; Proteins; protein; article; biology; chemistry; computer interface; computer program; genetic disorder; genetics; human; human genome; methodology; mutation; protein conformation; protein database; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Genome, Human; Humans; Mutation; Protein Conformation; Proteins; Software; User-Computer Interface","Venselaar, H.; CMBI, PO Box 9101, 6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; email: h.venselaar@cmbi.ru.nl",,,14712105,,BBMIC,"21059217","English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049484011

Firms that adopt a science-oriented research approach (i.e., ""science"") allow their researchers to pursue and publish an individual research agenda. The adoption of science may be associated with a ""taste"" for science on the part of researchers (a preference effect) and/or as a ""ticket of admission"" to gain earlier access to scientific discoveries with commercial application (a productivity effect). These two effects differ in their impact on wages. Whereas the preference effect contributes to a negative compensating differential, the productivity effect may result in rent sharing. However, because science may be adopted by firms employing higher-quality researchers, cross-sectional evaluations of wages and science may be biased by unobserved heterogeneity. To overcome this bias, this paper introduces a novel empirical approach. Specifically, prior to accepting a given job, many scientists receive multiple job offers, allowing for the calculation of the wage-science relationship and controlling for differences in salary levels offered to individual researchers. Using a dataset composed of multiple job offers to postdoctoral biologists, the results suggest a negative relationship between wages and science. These findings are robust to restricting the sample to nonacademic job offers, but the findings depend critically on the inclusion of researcher fixed effects. Conditional on perceived ability, scientists do indeed pay to be scientists.","Biology; Compensating differentials; Drug discovery; Economics of science; Hedonic wage equation; Multiple job offers; Pharmaceuticals; R&D employment; R&D management; Rent sharing","Compensating differentials; Drug discovery; Economics of science; Hedonic wage equation; Multiple job offers; R&D employment; R&D management; Rent sharing; Biology; Drug products; Knowledge engineering; Management science; Productivity; Research and development management; Wages; Economic and social effects","Stern, S.; Department of Management, , Evanston, IL 60208, United States; email: s-stern@northwestern.edu",,,00251909,,MSCIA,,"English","Manage Sci",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142605577

This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisive factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved. This paper provides a prototype IIS for environmental monitoring and management, and it also provides a new paradigm for the future research and practice; especially in the era of big data and IoT. © 2012 IEEE.","Big data; climate change; cloud computing; e-Science; enterprise systems; environmental monitoring and management; geoinformatics; industrial informatics; Internet of Things (IoT); System integration","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Cloud computing; Ecology; Gateways (computer networks); Geographic information systems; Information management; Internet; Middleware; Network layers; Research; Water resources; Web services; Websites; Big datum; e-Science; Enterprise system; Environmental Monitoring; Geo-informatics; Industrial informatics; Internet of Things (IOT); System integration; Environmental management","Fang, S.; LREIS, IGSNRR, CAS, Beijing 100101, China; email: fsfno1@163.com",,"IEEE Computer Society",15513203,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Prominent examples include internet companies and e-science. The Map-Reduce scalable dataow paradigm has become popular for these applications. Its simple, explicit dataow programming model is favored by some over the traditional high-level declarative approach: SQL. On the other hand, the extreme simplicity of Map-Reduce leads to much low-level hacking to deal with the many-step, branching dataows that arise in practice. Moreover, users must repeatedly code standard operations such as join by hand. These practices waste time, introduce bugs, harm readability, and impede optimizations. Pig is a high-level dataow system that aims at a sweet spot between SQL and Map-Reduce. Pig offers SQL-style high-level data manipulation constructs, which can be assembled in an explicit dataow and interleaved with custom Map- and Reduce-style functions or executables. Pig programs are compiled into sequences of Map-Reduce jobs, and executed in the Hadoop Map-Reduce environment. Both Pig and Hadoop are open-source projects administered by the Apache Software Foundation. This paper describes the challenges we faced in developing Pig, and reports performance comparisons between Pig execution and raw Map-Reduce execution. © 2009 VLDB Endowment.",,"Open source software; Open systems; Personal computing; Apache software foundations; Data manipulations; E-sciences; Executables; Open source projects; Performance comparison; Programming models; Sweet spot; Mammals","Gates, A.F.; Yahoo Inc.United States; email: gates@yahoo-inc.com",,"Association for Computing Machinery",21508097,,,,"English","Proc.

Geospatial CI (GCI) refers to CI that utilizes geospatial principles and geospatial information to transform how research, development, and education are conducted within and across science domains (such as the environmental and Earth sciences). GCI is based on recent advancements in geographic information science, information technology, computer networks, sensor networks, Web computing, CI, and e-research/e-science. This paper reviews the research, development, education, and other efforts that have contributed to building GCI in terms of its history, objectives, architecture, supporting technologies, functions, application communities, and future research directions. Similar to how GIS transformed the procedures for geospatial sciences, GCI provides significant improvements to how the sciences that need geospatial information will advance. The evolution of GCI will produce platforms for geospatial science domains and communities to better conduct research and development and to better collect data, access data, analyze data, model and simulate phenomena, visualize data and information, and produce knowledge. To achieve these transformative objectives, collaborative research and federated developments are needed for the following reasons: (1) to address social heterogeneity to identify geospatial problems encountered by relevant sciences and applications, (2) to analyze data for information flows and processing needed to solve the identified problems, (3) to utilize Semantic Web to support building knowledge and semantics into future GCI tools, (4) to develop geospatial middleware to provide functional and intermediate services and support service evolution for stakeholders, (5) to advance citizen-based sciences to reflect the fact that cyberspace is open to the public and citizen participation will be essential, (6) to advance GCI to geospatial cloud computing to implement the transparent and opaque platforms required for addressing fundamental science questions and application problems, and (7) to develop a research and development agenda that addresses these needs with good federation and collaboration across GCI communities, such as government agencies, non-government organizations, industries, academia, and the public. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Cloud computing; Cyberinfrastructure; Geospatial science; SDI; Spatial computing; Virtual organizations","Cloud computing; Cyber infrastructures; Geospatial science; Spatial computing; Virtual organization; Biology; Data processing; Decision support systems; Distributed computer systems; Industrial research; Information management; Information science; Internet protocols; Middleware; Multi agent systems; Semantic Web; Semantics; Societies and institutions; Wavelet transforms; Government data processing; computer simulation; data processing; GIS; information technology; Internet; numerical model; research and development; research work; software; spatial data; virtual reality; visualization","Yang, C.; Joint Center for Intelligent Spatial Computing and Dept. of Geography and GeoInformation Science, , Fairfax, VA 22030-4444, United States; email: chaowei.yang.1@gmail.com",,,01989715,,CEUSD,,"English","Comput.

They are now increasingly seen as being relevant to many areas of e-Science and e-Business. The emergence of the Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA), to complement the ongoing activity on Web Services standards, promises to provide a service-based platform that can meet the needs of both business and scientific applications. Early Grid applications focused principally on the storage, replication and movement of file-based data. Now the need for the full integration of database technologies with Grid middleware is widely recognized. Not only do many Grid applications already use databases for managing metadata, but increasingly many are associated with large databases of domain-specific information (e.g. biological or astronomical data). This paper describes the design and implementation of OGSA-DAI, a service-based architecture for database access over the Grid. The approach involves the design of Grid Data Services that allow consumers to discover the properties of structured data stores and to access their contents. The initial focus has been on support for access to Relational and XML data, but the overall architecture has been designed to be extensible to accommodate different storage paradigms. The paper describes and motivates the design decisions that have been taken, and illustrates how the approach supports a range of application scenarios.

Participants in such development projects find themselves caught with one foot in the demands of the present and the other in a desired future. In this paper we seek to capture participants' formulation of problems as they go about developing long-term information infrastructure. Drawing from cross-case ethnographic studies of four US e-infrastructure projects for the earth and environmental sciences (cyberinfrastructure), we trace nine tensions as they are framed and articulated by participants. To assist in understanding participants' orientations we abstract three concerns - motivating contribution, aligning end goals, and designing for use - which manifest themselves uniquely at each of the 'scales of infrastructure': institutionalization, the organization of work, and enacting technology. The concept of the long now helps us understand that participants seek to simultaneously address all three concerns in long-term development endeavors. © 2009, by the Association for Information Systems.","Communities; Cyberinfrastructure; eScience; Ethnography; Grounded Theory; Infrastructure; Long-term; Science; Sustainability","Ecosystems; Information systems; Cyber infrastructures; e-Science; Ethnography; Grounded theory; Infrastructure; Long-term; Science; Sustainable development","Ribes, D.; Georgetown UniversityUnited States; email: dr273@georgetown.edu",,"Association for Information Systems",15369323,,,,"English","J.

Current functionality has arisen from modelling in the fields of cancer, cardiac physiology and soft-tissue mechanics. It is released under the LGPL 2.1 licence. Chaste has been developed using agile programming methods. The project began in 2005 when it was reasoned that the modelling of a variety of physiological phenomena required both a generic mathematical modelling framework, and a generic computational/simulation framework. The Chaste project evolved from the Integrative Biology (IB) e-Science Project, an inter-institutional project aimed at developing a suitable IT infrastructure to support physiome-level computational modelling, with a primary focus on cardiac and cancer modelling.

For instance, provenance enables the reproducibility of scientific results; provenance is necessary to track attribution and credit in curated databases; and, it is essential for reasoners to make trust judgements about the information they use over the Semantic Web. As the Web allows information sharing, discovery, aggregation, filtering and flow in an unprecedented manner, it also becomes very difficult to identify, reliably, the original source that produced an information item on the Web. Since the emerging use of provenance in niche applications is undoubtedly demonstrating the benefits of provenance, this monograph contends that provenance can and should reliably be tracked and exploited on the Web, and investigates the necessary foundations to achieve such a vision. Multiple data sources have been used to compile the largest bibliographical database on provenance so far. This large corpus permits the analysis of emerging trends in the research community. Specifically, the CiteSpace tool identifies clusters of papers that constitute research fronts, from which characteristics are extracted to structure a foundational framework for provenance on the Web. Such an endeavour requires a multi-disciplinary approach, since it requires contributions from many computer science sub-disciplines, but also other non-technical fields given the human challenge that is anticipated. To develop such a vision, it is necessary to provide a definition of provenance that applies to the Web context. A conceptual definition of provenance is expressed in terms of processes, and is shown to generalise various definitions of provenance commonly encountered. Furthermore, by bringing realistic distributed systems assumptions, this definition is refined as a query over assertions made by applications. Given that the majority of work on provenance has been undertaken by the database, workflow and e-science communities, some of their work is reviewed, contrasting approaches, and focusing on important topics believed to be crucial for bringing provenance to the Web, such as abstraction, collections, storage, queries, workflow evolution, semantics and activities involving human interactions. However, provenance approaches developed in the context of databases and workflows essentially deal with closed systems. By that, it is meant that workflow or database management systems are in full control of the data they manage, and track their provenance within their own scope, but not beyond. In the context of the Web, a broader approach is required by which chunks of provenance representation can be brought together to describe the provenance of information flowing across multiple systems. For this purpose, this monograph puts forward the Open Provenance Vision, which is an approach that consists of controlled vocabulary, serialisation formats and interfaces to allow the provenance of individual systems to be expressed, connected in a coherent fashion, and queried seamlessly. In this context, the Open Provenance Model is an emerging community-driven representation of provenance, which has been actively used by some 20 teams to exchange provenance information, in line with the Open Provenance Vision. After identifying an open approach and a model for provenance, techniques to expose provenance over the Web are investigated. In particular, Semantic Web technologies are discussed since they have been successfully exploited to express, query and reason over provenance. Symmetrically, Semantic Web technologies such as RDF, underpinning the Linked Data effort, are analysed since they offer their own difficulties with respect to provenance. A powerful argument for provenance is that it can help make systems transparent, so that it becomes possible to determine whether a particular use of information is appropriate under a set of rules. Such capability helps make systems and information accountable. To offer accountability, provenance itself must be authentic, and rely on security approaches, which are described in the monograph. This is then followed by systems where provenance is the basis of an auditing mechanism to check past processes against rules or regulations. In practice, not all users want to check and audit provenance, instead, they may rely on measures of quality or trust; hence, emerging provenance-based approaches to compute trust and quality of data are reviewed. © 2010 L.

Studying infrastructure development empirically not only in terms of spatial issues but also, and equally importantly, temporal ones, we illustrate how the long-term matters. Our case is about the collaborative development of a metadata standard for an ecological research domain. It is a complex example where standards are recognized as one element of infrastructure and standard-making efforts include integration of semantic work and software tools development. With a focus on the temporal scales of short-term and long-term, we analyze the practices and views of the main parties involved in the development of the standard. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) extension of the notion of infrastructure to more explicitly include the temporal dimension; 2) identification of two distinct temporal orientations in information infrastructure development work, namely 'project time' and 'infrastructure time', and 3) association of related development orientations, particularly 'continuing design' as a development orientation that recognizes 'infrastructure time'. We conclude by highlighting the need to enrich understandings of temporality in CSCW, particularly towards longer time scales and more diversified temporal hybrids in collaborative infrastructure development. This work draws attention to the manifold ramifications that 'infrastructure time', as an example of more extended temporal scales, suggests for CSCW and e-Research infrastructures. © 2010 The Author(s).","Collaborative information infrastructure development; Continuing design; Cyberinfrastructure; Development orientation; e-Infrastructure; e-Research; e-Science; Long-Term Ecological Research; Metadata standard; Standard-making; Temporal orientation","Collaborative information; Continuing design; Cyber infrastructures; Development orientations; e-Infrastructure; E-research; e-Science; Long-term ecological research; Metadata standard; Temporal orientation; Design; Ecology; Groupware; Metadata; Research; Software design; Standardization","Karasti, H.; Department of Information Processing Science, P.O.

The infrastructure needed to support such projects must permit routine sharing of distributed and heterogeneous computational and data resources as well as supporting effective collaboration between groups of scientists. Such an infrastructure is commonly referred to as the Grid. Apart from £10 M towards a Teraflop computer, the remaining funds, some £35 M, constitute the e-Science 'Core Programme'. The goal of this Core Programme is to advance the development of robust and generic Grid middleware in collaboration with industry. The key elements of the Core Programme will be outlined including details of a UK e-Science Grid testbed. The pilot e-Science projects that have so far been announced are then briefly described. These projects span a range of disciplines from particle physics and astronomy to engineering and healthcare, and illustrate the breadth of the UK e-Science Programme. In addition to these major e-Science projects, the Core Programme is funding a series of short-term e-Science demonstrators across a number of disciplines as well as projects in network traffic engineering and some international collaborative activities.

""Big science"" fields such as physics and astronomy that collaborate around expensive instrumentation have constructed shared digital libraries to manage their data and documents, while ""little science"" research areas that gather data through hand-crafted fieldwork continue to manage their data locally. As habitat ecology researchers begin to deploy embedded sensor networks, they are confronting an array of challenges in capturing, organizing, and managing large amounts of data. The scientists and their partners in computer science and engineering make use of common datasets but interpret the data differently. Studies of this field in transition offer insights into the role of digital libraries in e-Science, how data practices evolve as science becomes more instrumented, and how scientists, computer scientists, and engineers collaborate around data. Among the lessons learned are that data on the same variables are gathered by multiple means, that data exist in many states and in many places, and that publication practices often drive data collection practices. Data sharing is embraced in principle but little sharing actually occurs, due to interrelated factors such as lack of demand, lack of standards, and concerns about publication, ownership, data quality, and ethics.

Here, we assess the MSM as an analysis method by constructing a Markov model from ultralong trajectories, specifically two previously reported 100μs trajectories of the FiP35 WW domain (Shaw, D. E.Science 2010, 330, 341-346). We find that the MSM approach yields novel insights. It discovers new statistically significant folding pathways, in which either beta-hairpin of the WW domain can form first. The rates of this process approach experimental values in a direct quantitative comparison (time scales of 5.0μs and 100 ns), within a factor of ∼2. Finally, the hub-like topology of the MSM and identification of a holo conformation predicts how WW domains may function through a conformational selection mechanism. © 2011 American Chemical Society.",,"Analysis method; Beta-hairpin; Conformational selection; Experimental values; Folding pathway; Markov model; Markov State models; Molecular simulations; Process approach; Quantitative comparison; Specialized hardware; Statistical interpretation; Time-scales; WW domain; Computer simulation; Markov processes; Sampling; Trajectories; article; hidden Markov model; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; protein localization; Markov Chains; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Protein Folding; Proteins","Pande, V.S.; Department of Chemistry, , Stanford, CA 94305, United States; email: pande@stanford.edu",,,00027863,,JACSA,"21988563","English","J.

Furthermore, co-presence as an approach to doing fieldwork generates new prospects for the study of knowledge production.

Such an augmented reality computer-mediated learning system has been developed as part of an EU funded research project, namely the CONNECT project. The CONNECT project brings together schools and science centres, and produces novel information and communication technologies based on augmented reality (AR) and web-based streaming and communication, in order to support learning in a variety of settings. The CONNECT AR interactive learning environment can assist users to better contextualize and reinforce their learning in school and in other settings where people learn (i.e. science centres and home). The CONNECT concept and associated technologies encourage users to visit science centres and perform experiments that are not possible in school. They can also build on these experiences back at school and at home with visual augmentations that they are communicated through web-based streaming technology. This paper particularly focuses on a user-centred evaluation approach of human factors and pedagogical aspects of the CONNECT system, as applied to a special needs user group. The main focus of the paper is on highlighting the human factors issues and challenges, in terms of wearability and technology acceptance, while elaborating on some qualitative aspects of the pedagogical effectiveness of the instructional medium that AR technology offers for this group of learners. © pringer-Verlag London Limited 2007.","Augmented reality; Human factors; Science education","E-learning; Education; Heterogeneous networks; Human engineering; Internet; Multimedia systems; Project management; Quality control; Technology; Virtual reality; Wireless networks; Computer-mediated learning; Content representations; Contextualize; Evaluation approaches; Human factors; Interactive learning environments; Issues and challenges; Mobile augmented realities; Novel informations; Pedagogical aspects; Physical disabilities; Qualitative aspects; Real environments; Science education; Service deliveries; Streaming technologies; Support learning; Technology acceptances; Technology-enhanced learning; User groups; Visual perceptions; Augmented reality","Arvanitis, T.N.; Department of Electronic, Electrical and Computer Engineering, , Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 2TT, United Kingdom; email: t.arvanitis@bham.ac.uk",,,16174909,,,,"English","Pers.

The challenge we address is to record uniform and usable provenance metadata that meets the domain needs while minimizing the modification burden on the service authors and the performance overhead on the workflow engine and the services. The framework is based on generating discrete provenance activities during the lifecycle of a workflow execution that can be aggregated to form complex data and process provenance graphs that can span across workflows. The implementation uses a loosely coupled publish-subscribe architecture for propagating these activities, and the capabilities of the system satisfy the needs of detailed provenance collection. A performance evaluation of a prototype finds a minimal performance overhead (in the range of 1% for an eight-service workflow using 271 data products).

About 90% of the inter-connected databases handle data that are used for the interpretation of astronomical spectra and for modelling in many fields of astrophysics. Recently the VAMDC Consortium has connected databases from the radiation damage and the plasma communities, as well as promoting the publication of data from Indian institutes. This paper describes how the VAMDC Consortium is organised for the optimal distribution of atomic and molecular data for scientific research. It is noted that the VAMDC Consortium strongly advocates that authors of research papers using data cite the original experimental and theoretical papers as well as the relevant databases. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.","astrophysics; atoms; databases; kinetic data; molecules; spectroscopy","Astrophysics; Database systems; Molecules; Radiation damage; Spectroscopy; E-science infrastructures; Kinetic data; Molecular data; Molecular database; Optimal distributions; Research papers; Scientific researches; Atoms",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",09534075,,JPAPE,,"English","J Phys B At Mol Opt Phys",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962809965

The disintermediated paradigm of content production and consumption on online social media might foster the formation of homogeneous communities (echo-chambers) around specific worldviews. Such a scenario has been shown to be a vivid environment for the diffusion of false claim. Not rarely, viral phenomena trigger naive (and funny) social responses - e.g., the recent case of Jade Helm 15 where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of the civil war in the US. In this work, we address the emotional dynamics of collective debates around distinct kinds of information - i.e., science and conspiracy news - and inside and across their respective polarized communities. We find that for both kinds of content the longer the discussion the more the negativity of the sentiment. We show that comments on conspiracy posts tend to be more negative than on science posts. However, the more the engagement of users, the more they tend to negative commenting (both on science and conspiracy). Finally, zooming in at the interaction among polarized communities, we find a general negative pattern. As the number of comments increases - i.e., the discussion becomes longer - the sentiment of the post is more and more negative. © 2015 Zollo et al.",,"army; exercise; human; emotion; female; interpersonal communication; male; Communication; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male",,,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"26422473","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947750648

Advance reservation (AR) is essential to support initial-delay- tolerant services, such as e-science and grid computing, which are making significant contributions to the Internet traffic. Therefore, we expect that it is necessary for future EONs to support AR requests. In this paper, we study dynamic service provisioning of AR requests in EONs. These AR requests permit certain initial-delay during setting-up, as long as the resources are allocated before a preset deadline. We propose several algorithms that combine request scheduling in the time domain with routing, modulation and spectrum assignment (RMSA) in the spectrum domain. Specifically, with the combination of a routing path selection policy and a request scheduling strategy, the algorithm constructs a weight matrix for each pending AR request and provisions the request with it. We design numerical simulations to investigate the algorithms' performance in terms of three metrics, i.e., blocking probability, average spectrum efficiency, and average initial-delay. Based on the simulation results and computational complexity analysis, we provide suggestions on how to choose routing path selection policy and request scheduling strategy for provisioning AR requests dynamically in EONs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address dynamic service provisioning of AR requests in EONs. © 1983-2012 IEEE.","Advance reservation (AR); AR request scheduling; dynamic routing; elastic optical networks; modulation and spectrum assignment (RMSA)","Advance reservation; Dynamic routing; Elastic optical networks; Request scheduling; Spectrum assignment; Algorithms; Grid computing; Internet; Modulation; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Scheduling; Fiber optic networks","Lu, W.; School of Information Science and Technology, , Hefei, Anhui 230027, China",,,07338724,,JLTED,,"English","J Lightwave Technol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876223823

However, there has been little principled analysis of what is actually required of a provenance architecture, so it is impossible to determine the functionality they would ideally support.

This contribution describes the design of DFT-calculated descriptors for monodentate phosphorus(III) donor ligands in a range of representative complexes. Using the resulting data, a ligand space is mapped and predictive models are derived for metal complexes. Important characteristics, including chemical, computational and statistical robustness for the generation and exploitation of such an LKB are described. Chemical robustness ensures transferability of the descriptors, as well as comprehensive sampling of ligand space. To make the calculations amenable to automation in an e-science setting, a reliable, well-defined computational approach has been sought from which the descriptors can be readily extracted. The LKB has been explored with multivariate statistical methods. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used for the mapping of chemical space, projecting multiple descriptors into scatter plots which illustrate the clustering of chemically similar ligands. Interpretation of the resulting principal components in terms of established steric and electronic properties and the importance of its statistical robustness to variations in the ligand set are discussed. Multiple linear regression (MLR) models have been derived, demonstrating the versatility of the descriptors for modeling varied experimentally determined parameters (bond lengths, reaction enthalpies and bond-stretching frequencies). The importance of re-sampling methods for testing the robustness of predictions is highlighted. A strategy for the construction of a robust LKB suitable for the modeling of ligand and complex behavior is outlined based on these observations. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The myGrid project is developing the use of workflows to explicitly capture web-based procedures, and provenance to describe how and why results were produced. Experience within myGrid has shown that this provenance metadata is formed from a complex web of heterogenous resources that impact on the production of a result. Therefore we have explored the use of Semantic Web technologies such as RDF, and ontologies to support its representation and used existing initiatives such as Jena and LSID, to generate and store such material. The effective presentation of complex RDF graphs is challenging. Haystack has been used to provide multiple views of provenance metadata that can be further annotated.

With the evolution of e-Science, workflows are becoming larger and more computational demanding. Such e-Science necessities match with what computational Grids have to offer. Grids are shared distributed platforms which will eventually receive multiple requisitions to execute workflows. With this, there is a demand for a scheduler which deals with multiple workflows in the same set of resources, thus the development of multiple workflow scheduling algorithms is necessary. In this paper we describe four different initial strategies for scheduling multiple workflows on Grids and evaluate them in terms of schedule length and fairness. We present results for the initial schedule and for the makespan after the execution with external load. From the results we conclude that interleaving the workflows on the Grid leads to good average makespan and provides fairness when multiple workflows share the same set of resources. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Grid computing; Scheduling; Workflow","Computational grids; Distributed platforms; e-Science; External loads; Initial schedule; Makespan; Schedule length; Work-flows; Workflow scheduling; Data description; Grid computing; Scheduling algorithms; Management","Bittencourt, L.

In this paper, we describe two e-science infrastructures: Science and Engineering Applications Grid (SEAGrid) and molecular modeling and parametrization (ParamChem). The SEAGrid is a virtual organization with a diverse set of hardware and software resources and provides services to access such resources in a routine and transparent manner. These essential services include allocations of computational resources, client-side application interfaces, computational job and data management tools, and consulting activities. ParamChem is another e-science project dedicated for molecular force-field parametrization based on both ab-initio and molecular mechanics calculations on high performance computers (HPCs) driven by scientific workflow middleware services. Both the projects share a similar three-tier computational infrastructure that consists of a front-end client, a middleware web services layer, and a remote HPC computational layer. The client is a Java Swing desktop application with components for pre- and post-data processing, communications with middleware server and local data management. The middleware service is based on Axis2 web service and MySQL relational database, which provides functionalities for user authentication and session control, HPC resource information collections, discovery and matching, job information logging and notification. It can also be integrated with scientific workflow to manage computations on HPC resources. The grid credentials for accessing HPCs are delegated through MyProxy infrastructure. Currently SEAGrid has integrated several popular application software suites such as Gaussian for quantum chemistry, NAMD for molecular dynamics and engineering software such as Abacus for mechanical engineering.

Design/methodology/approach - The concepts of e-Science are illustrated by a discussion of the CombeChem, eBank and SmartTea projects. The issue of open access is then discussed with reference to arXiv, PubMed Central and EPrints. The challenges these trends present to the library community are discussed in the context of the TARDis project and the University of Southampton Research Repository. Findings - Increasingly academics will need to collaborate in multidisciplinary teams distributed across several sites in order to address the next generation of scientific problems. In addition, new high-throughput devices, high-resolution surveys and sensor networks will result in an increase in scientific data collected by several orders of magnitude. To analyze, federate and mine this data will require collaboration between scientists and computer scientists; to organize, curate and preserve this data will require collaboration between scientists and librarians. A vital part of the developing research infrastructure will be digital repositories containing both publications and data. Originality/value - The paper provides a synthesis of e-Science concepts, the question of open access to the results of scientific research, and a changing attitude towards academic publishing and communication. The paper offers a new perspective on coming demands on the library and is of special interest to librarians with strategic tasks.","Digital libraries; Digital storage",,"Hey, T.; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, United States; email: tonyhey@microsoft.com",,,07378831,,,,"English","Libr.

With the recent emergence of cloud computing and the rapid deployment of cloud infrastructures, an increasing number of scientific workflows have been shifted or are in active transition to cloud environments. As cloud computing makes computing a utility, scientists across different application domains are facing the same challenge of reducing financial cost in addition to meeting the traditional goal of performance optimization. We develop a prototype generic workflow system by leveraging existing technologies for a quick evaluation of scientific workflow optimization strategies. We construct analytical models to quantify the network performance of scientific workflows using cloud-based computing resources, and formulate a task scheduling problem to minimize the workflow end-to-end delay under a user-specified financial constraint. We rigorously prove that the proposed problem is not only NP-complete but also non-approximable. We design a heuristic solution to this problem, and illustrate its performance superiority over existing methods through extensive simulations and real-life workflow experiments based on proof-of-concept implementation and deployment in a local cloud testbed. © 2013 IEEE.","cloud computing; Scientific workflows; workflow scheduling","Budget control; Cloud computing; Heuristic methods; Cloud based computing; Cloud infrastructures; Extensive simulations; Financial constraints; Performance optimizations; Scientific workflows; Task scheduling problem; Workflow scheduling; Optimization",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21687161,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

While all of them address different visions and needs, they share a common theme: How do we manage massive amounts of heterogeneous data, derive knowledge out of them instead of drowning in information, and how do we make our findings reproducible and reusable by others? In a network of knowledge, topics span across scientific disciplines and the idea of domain ontologies as common agreements seems like an illusion. In this work, we argue that these trends require a radical paradigm shift in ontology engineering away from a small number of authoritative, global ontologies developed top-down, to a high number of local ontologies that are driven by application needs and developed bottom-up out of observation data. Similarly as the early Web was replaced by a social Web in which volunteers produce data instead of purely consuming it, the next generation of knowledge infrastructures has to enable users to become knowledge engineers themselves. Surprisingly, existing ontology engineering frameworks are not well suited for this new perspective. Hence, we propose an observation-driven ontology engineering framework, show how its layers can be realized using specific methodologies, and relate the framework to existing work on geo-ontologies. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"bottom-up approach; infrastructure; Internet; philosophy","Janowicz, K.; Department of Geography, , Santa Barbara, CA 93106-4060, United States; email: jano@geog.ucsb.edu",,,13611682,,TRGIF,,"English","Trans.

By analyzing the ""life stages"" of data in four academic projects, we show that these requirements create difficulties for disciplines where tacit knowledge and craft-like methods are deeply embedded in researchers, as well as for disciplines producing non-digital heterogeneous data or data derived from people rather than from material phenomena.

The effective management of such experiments requires a specific set of cardinal facilities, such as experiment specification techniques, workflow derivation heuristics and provenance mechanisms. These facilities may characterise the experiment life cycle into three phases: composition, execution, and analysis. Works concerned with supporting scientific workflows are mainly concerned with the execution and analysis phase. Therefore, they fail to support the scientific experiment throughout its life cycle as a set of integrated experimentation technologies. In large scale experiments this represents a research challenge. We propose an approach for managing large scale experiments based on provenance gathering during all phases of the life cycle.

These Grids follow a restricted organizational model wherein a Virtual Organization (VO) is created for a specific collaboration and all interactions such as resource sharing are limited to within the VO. Therefore, dispersed Grid initiatives have led to the creation of disparate Grids with little or no interaction between them. In this paper, we propose a model that: (a) promotes interlinking of islands of Grids through peering arrangements to enable InterGrid resource sharing; (b) provides a scalable structure for Grids that allow them to interconnect with one another and grow in a sustainable way; (c) creates a global Cyberinfrastructure to support e-Science and e-Business applications. This work identifies and proposes architecture, mechanisms, and policies that allow the internetworking of Grids and allows Grids to grow in a similar manner as the Internet. We term the structure resulting from such internetworking between Grids as the InterGrid. The proposed InterGrid architecture is composed of InterGrid Gateways responsible for managing peering arrangements between Grids. We discuss the main components of the architecture and present a research agenda to enable the InterGrid vision.

This study describes and compares science knowledge, science vocabulary, and cognitive strategy use among four diverse groups of elementary students: (a) monolingual English Caucasian, (b) African‐American, (c) bilingual Spanish, and (d) bilingual Haitian Creole. To facilitate science performance in culturally and linguistically congruent settings, the study included student dyads and teachers of the same language, culture, and gender. Science performance was observed using three science tasks: weather phenomena, simple machines, and buoyancy. Data analysis involved a range of qualitative methods focusing on major themes and patterns, and quantitative methods using coding systems to summarize frequencies and total scores. The findings reveal distinct patterns of science knowledge, science vocabulary, and cognitive strategy use among the four language and culture groups. The findings also indicate relationships among science knowledge, science vocabulary, and cognitive strategy use. These findings raise important issues about science instruction for culturally and linguistically diverse groups of students.

Existing research on TPACK shows little about in-service secondary school science teachers' TPACK through a quantitative approach. The purposes of this study were to explore TPACK of secondary school science teachers using a new contextualized TPACK model. Associations between in-service teachers' TPACK and other factors were also examined. The TPACK questionnaire was mailed to secondary schools randomly selected across different parts of Taiwan, and return envelopes were provided for completed questionnaires. There were 1292 science teachers from secondary schools for factor analysis. An independent samples t-test was conducted when there were two groups (i.e., gender) to be compared for TPACK. ANOVA was conducted when there were more than two groups (i.e., science teaching experience) compared for TPACK. The results indicated that secondary science teachers' TPACK was statistically significant according to gender and teaching experience. With the consideration of other TPACK sub-components, male science teachers rated their technology knowledge significantly higher than did female teachers. Experienced science teachers tended to rate their content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge in context (PCKCx) significantly higher than did novice science teachers. However, science teachers with less teaching experience tended to rate their technology knowledge and technological content knowledge in context (TPCKCx) significantly higher than did teachers with more teaching experience.

In most cases, large scale scientific computation is represented as a workflow for scheduling and runtime provisioning. Such scheduling become an even more challenging problem on cloud systems due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, in particular, the elasticity, the pricing models (both static and dynamic), the non-homogeneous resource types, the vast array of services, and virtualization. This mapping of workflow tasks on to a set of provisioned instances is an example of the general scheduling problem and is NP-complete. In addition, we also need to ensure that certain runtime constraints are met-the most typical being the cost of the computation and the time which that computation requires to complete. In this article, we introduce a new heuristic scheduling algorithm, Budget Deadline Aware Scheduling (BDAS), that addresses eScience workflow scheduling under budget and deadline constraints in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds. The novelty of our work is satisfying both budget and deadline constraints while introducing a tunable cost-time trade off over heterogeneous instances. In addition, we study the stability and robustness of our algorithm by performing sensitivity analysis. The results demonstrate that overall BDAS finds a viable schedule for more than 40000 test cases accomplishing both defined constraints: budget and deadline. Moreover, our algorithm achieves a 17.0-23.8 percent higher success rate when compared to state of the art algorithms. © 1990-2012 IEEE.","budget; cloud; deadline; scheduling; Scientific workflow","Budget control; Cloud computing; Clouds; Costs; Economic and social effects; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Job analysis; Scheduling; Sensitivity analysis; Budget; Deadline; Dynamic scheduling; Scientific workflows; Task analysis; Scheduling algorithms","Arabnejad, V.; School of Engineering and Computer Science, New Zealand; email: vahid.arabnejad@ecs.vuw.ac.nz",,"IEEE Computer Society",10459219,,ITDSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Parallel Distrib Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049309028

The recent advent of passive data collection technologies, e.g., automated fare collection (AFC) and automated vehicle location (AVL), has shifted a data-poor environment to a data-rich environment and offered opportunities for transit agencies to conduct comprehensive transit system performance measures. However, most AFC and AVL systems are not designed for transit performance measures, implying that additional data processing and visualization procedures are needed to improve both data usability and accessibility. This study attempts to develop a data-driven platform for online transit performance monitoring. The primary data sources come from the AFC and AVL systems in Beijing, where a passenger's boarding stop (origin) and alighting stop (destination) on a flat-rate bus are not recorded. The individual transit rider's origin and destination can be estimated by utilizing a series of data-mining techniques, which are then incorporated into a regional-map platform for transit performance measures. A multilevel framework is proposed to calculate the network-level speed, route-level travel time reliability, stop-level ridership, and headway variance. These statistics are interactively displayed on a map through a simplified transit GIS data model. This platform not only serves as a data-rich visualization platform to monitor transit network performance for planning and operations, it also intends to take advantage of e-science initiative for data-driven transportation research and applications. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Automated fare collection system; Automated vehicle location system; Data-driven platform; Transit gis data model; Transit performance measures","Automation; Customer satisfaction; Data handling; Data visualization; Smart cards; Travel time; Vehicle locating systems; Vehicle performance; Visualization; Automated fare collection; Automated vehicle locations; Data driven; GIS data; Performance measure; Data mining; automation; data processing; GIS; GPS; Internet; visualization; Beijing [China]; China","Wang, Y.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Box 352700, United States",,"American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",0733947X,,,,"English","J.

In this article, the way modern means of disseminating information will change the practice of taxonomy, in particular the Internet, is explored. Basic taxonomic information, such as specimen-level data, location of types, and name catalogues are already available, at least for some groups, on theWeb. Specialist taxonomic databases, key-construction programs, and other software useful for systematists are also increasingly available. There has also been a move towardsWeb-publishing of taxonomic hypotheses, though as yet this is not fully permitted by the Codes of Nomenclature.Afurther and more radical move would be to transfer taxonomy completely to the Web. A possible model of this is discussed, as well as a pilot project, the ""CATE"" initiative, which seeks to explore the advantages and disadvantages of such a move. It is argued that taxonomy needs to forge better links with its user-communities to maintain its funding base, and that an important part of this is making the products of its research more accessible through the Internet.

Observations such as these usually have been taken to be an indication of the involvement of poly(adenosine diphosphoribose) in the repair of DNA damage. It has been reported that some inhibitors of adenosine diphosphoribosyl transferase (ADPRT) affect cell viability, glucose metabolism, and DNA synthesis when present at low concentrations in the growth medium for extended periods (e.g., lymphoid cells exposed to a few millimolar for 24 h [Milam, K. M., and Cleaver, J. E. Science (Wash. DC), 223: 589, 1984]}. The latter report questioned previous interpretations of radiation results based on the use of ADPRT inhibitors which enhance cell killing. We have studied the enhanced radiation lethality of Chinese hamster cells using higher concentrations of these inhibitors, but for shorter periods, in an effort to determine if metabolic perturbations are produced and if they are relatable to enhanced cell killing. The compounds used were 2-aminobenzamide, 3-ami-nobenzamide, 4-aminobenzamide, benzamide, and nicotinamide, compounds which show a large variation in their potency as inhibitors of ADPRT. It was found that none of the compounds was toxic at the highest doses used (20 mM for 2 h) and that, during a 2-h period, the potent inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide had little or no effect on DNA synthesis. Two h is long enough to yield a near-maximum radiosensitization with 3-aminobenzamide. Although glucose metabolism was affected to varying degrees (up to a 50% inhibition by 4-aminobenzamide in 2 h), there was no correlation between effectiveness in inhibiting ADPRT and effectiveness in inhibiting glucose metabolism. A correlation was observed, however, between the inhibitory potential of ADPRT and the enhancement of radiation response. When used for sufficiently short times, we conclude that the effects at even high concentrations of a potent inhibitor of ADPRT (e.g., 3-aminobenzamide) are consistent with an involvement of poly(adenosine diphosphoribose) synthesis in the expression of a radiation-induced end point like cell killing. © 1985, American Association for Cancer Research.

To meet this need, we design novel admission control (AC) and scheduling algorithms for bulk data transfer in research networks for e-science. Due to their small sizes, the research networks can afford a centralized resource management platform. In our design, each bulk transfer job request, which can be made in advance to the central network controller, specifies a start time and an end time. If admitted, the network guarantees to complete the transfer before the end time. However, there is flexibility in how the actual transfer is carried out, that is, in the bandwidth assignment on each allowed path of the job on each time interval, and it is up to the scheduling algorithm to decide this. To improve the network resource utilization or lower the job rejection ratio, the network controller solves optimization problems in making AC and scheduling decisions. Our design combines the following elements into a cohesive optimization-based framework: advance reservations, multipath routing, and bandwidth reassignment via periodic reoptimization.

The emergence of a service-oriented view of hardware and software resources raises the question as to how database management systems and technologies can best be deployed or adapted for use in such an environment. This paper explores one aspect of service-based computing and data management, viz., how to integrate query processing technology with a service-based Grid. The paper describes in detail the design and implementation of a service-based distributed query processor for the Grid. The query processor is service-based in two orthogonal senses: firstly, it supports querying over data storage and analysis resources that are made available as services, and, secondly, its internal architecture factors out as services the functionalities related to the construction of distributed query plans on the one hand, and to their execution over the Grid on the other. The resulting system both provides a declarative approach to service orchestration in the Grid, and demonstrates how query processing can benefit from dynamic access to computational resources on the Grid. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,"Digital storage; Distributed computer systems; Information management; Memory architecture; Query processing; Web services; Computational resources; Design and implementations; Distributed applications; Internal architecture; Open grid services architecture; Processing technologies; Service orchestration; Service-based computing; Distributed database systems","Alpdemir, M.N.; Department of Computer Science, Oxford Road, Manchester M13 9PL, United Kingdom","Orlowska M.E.Weerawarana S.Weerawarana S.Papazoglou M.P.Yang J.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783540206811,,,"English","Lect.

This study collected data from consumers having bought goods on the e-shopping platform. Design/methodology/approach – This study adopted online questionnaire through my3q (www.my3q.com) for data collection. This research collected and analyzed 866 samples by using the structural equation modeling for validation of the proposed model. Findings – The results indicated that hedonic value, utilitarian value, security, and privacy significantly affected cognitive attitudes (i.e. cognitive trust and perceived risk). Cognitive attitudes significantly affected perceived satisfaction and purchase intention, respectively. Flow significantly and positively influenced cognitive trust and purchase intentions, respectively. Cognitive trust is the mediators between motivations/flow and perceived satisfaction/purchase intention. Research limitations/implications – Both of intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation can reflect the cognitive and conscious plan of an individual for a particular task. The cognitive trust and perceived risk are partial mediator and full mediator in the model, respectively. Hedonic value, utilitarian value, security, privacy, and flow all affect the individual’s perceived satisfaction and purchase intention through cognitive trust and perceived risk in the context of online shopping. Cognitive trust is a full mediator of the effects of privacy on purchase intention. It indicates that consumers must fully trust the website to ensure that the information provided by consumers in the transaction will not spread out for the protection of personal privacy. Practical implications – This study aimed to assist the marketing personnel of the EC industry to examine the key influential factors of consumers’ purchase satisfactions and purchase intentions. The results of this study indicated that cognitive trust is the foundation for gaining and retaining customers. The classification of consumer motivations facilitates the understanding of consumers’ demands and accurate interpretation of consumers’ needs. The main influential factor of cognitive trust is utilitarian value. Therefore, this study states that the primary intrinsic motivation of online shopping for most consumers is utilitarian value (e.g. saving time, the cost of searching for the appropriate products, and increasing purchasing efficiency). Social implications – Websites should strengthen the quality and quantity of product information. In addition, websites should provide a dynamic presentation of the product by presenting in various forms (multimedia and text description) about product-related information in order to increase consumers’ hedonic value. For the aspects of security and privacy, websites should provide consumers with reliable safety features, such as secure socket layer or digital signature, smooth communication channel (specific phone services and e-mail address), and consumer’s privacy statements. Finally, web design should meet with the consumer experience model in order to make the website easy to use and order the purchase from the website directly. Websites should also increase the fluency and positive experience of consumers and improve the interaction of a website. Meanwhile, websites need to feedback the consumer problem instantly and provide customized information in order to increase the chance of interaction between the consumers and the website. Originality/value – Relevant studies have explored online shopping from various perspectives, but few studies have examined consumers’ cognitive attitudes toward websites from the consumer motivation perspective. Thus, this study focussed on the influences of consumers’ intrinsic and extrinsic motivations (e.g. hedonic value, utilitarian value, security, and privacy) on their cognitive attitudes toward websites. In addition, with the rapid development of the internet in recent years, internet users’ online flow experiences have gained increased attention. The creation of attractive consumption conditions is vital for website managers to provide consumers with flow experiences. Therefore, this study included consumers’ flow in the proposed model. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Consumer behaviour/choice/demand/empowerment/reviews/consumerism; Customer satisfaction/service; E-marketing; E-science",,"Chih, W.-H.; Department of Business Administration, Taiwan; email: whchih@mail.ndhu.edu.tw",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09593845,,,,"English","Inf.

These application-led projects are underpinned by an emerging set of core middleware services that allow the coordinated, collaborative use of distributed resources. This set of middleware services runs on top of the research network and beneath the applications we call the 'Grid'. Grid middleware is currently in transition from pre-Web Service versions to a new version based on Web Services. Unfortunately, only a very basic set of Web Services embodied in the Web Services Interoperability proposal, WS-I, are agreed by most IT companies. IBM and others have submitted proposals for Web Services for Grids - the Web Services ResourceFramework and Web Services Notification specifications - to the OASIS organization for standardization. This process could take up to 12 months from March 2004 and the specifications are subject to debate and potentially significant changes. Since several significant U.K. e-Science projects come to an end before the end of this process, the U.K. needs to develop a strategy that will protect the U.K.'s investment in Grid middleware by informing the Open Middleware Infrastructure Institute's (OMII) roadmap and U.K. middleware repository in Southampton. This paper sets out an evolutionary roadmap that will allow us to capture generic middleware components from projects in a form that will facilitate migration or interoperability with the emerging Grid Web Services standards and with ongoing OGSA developments. In this paper we therefore define a set of Web Services specifications, which we call 'WS-I+' to reflect the fact that this is a larger set than currently accepted by WS-I, that we believe will enable us to achieve the twin goals of capturing these components and facilitating migration to future standards. We believe that the extra Web Services specifications we have included in WS-I+ are both helpful in building e-Science Grids and likely to be widely accepted.

More precisely, a user can navigate graphically through the individual RDF/S class and property definitions and generate transparently the RQL path expressions required to access the resources of interest. These expressions capture accurately the meaning of its navigation steps through the class (or property) subsumption and/or associations. Additionally, users can enrich the generated queries with filtering conditions on the attributes of the currently visited class while they can easily specify the resource's class(es) appearing in the query result.

Like their laboratory based counterparts, the data associated with an e-Science experiment are of reduced value if other scientists are not able to identify the origin, or provenance, of those data. Provenance is the term given to metadata about experiment processes, the derivation paths of data, and the sources and quality of experimental components, which includes the scientists themselves, related literature, etc. Consequently provenance metadata are valuable resources for e-Scientists to repeat experiments, track versions of data and experiment runs, verify experiment results, and as a source of experimental insight. One specific kind of in silica experiment is a workflow. In this paper we describe how we can assemble a Semantic Web of workflow provenance logs that allows a bioinformatician to browse and navigate between experimental components by generating hyperlinks based on semantic annotations associated with them.

The cloud allows researchers and institutions to only provision compute when required, and to scale seamlessly as needed. The cloud computing paradigm therefore presents a low capital, low barrier to operating dedicated HPC eScience infrastructure. However, there are still significant technical hurdles associated with obtaining sufficient execution performance while limiting the financial cost, in particular, a naive scheduling algorithm may increase the cost of computation to the point that using cloud resources is no longer a viable option. The work in this article concentrates on the problem of scheduling deadline constrained scientific workloads on dynamically provisioned cloud resources, while reducing the cost of computation. Specifically we present two algorithms, Proportional Deadline Constrained (PDC) and Deadline Constrained Critical Path (DCCP) that address the workflow scheduling problem on such dynamically provisioned cloud resources. These algorithms are additionally extended to refine their operation in task prioritization and backfilling respectively. The results in this article indicate that both PDC and DCCP algorithms achieve higher cost efficiencies and success rates when compared to existing algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud resources; Deadline constrained; Scheduling; Scientific workflows","Cloud computing; Costs; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Deadline constrained; E-science infrastructures; Execution performance; Financial costs; Scientific computation; Scientific workflows; Scientific workloads; Workflow scheduling; Computational complexity","Bubendorfer, K.email: kris@ecs.vuw.ac.nz",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011580139

Within the emerging service science community, service is often defined as the application of competences (resources) for the benefit of another. Grid computing is the study of resource sharing among entities, known as virtual organizations, which solve complex business, societal, scientific, and engineering problems. Within the Grid computing community, service is sometimes defined as protocols plus behavior. Both Grid computing and service science are connecting academic, industry, government, and volunteer sector collaborators on a range of projects including eScience, healthcare, environmental sustainability, and more.

Manycast is a point-to-multipoint communication paradigm with applications in e-Science, Grid, and cloud computing. A manycast request specifies a candidate set of destinations, of which a subset must be reached. To solve MA-RWA, a light-tree must be assigned to each manycast request in a static set such that the number of wavelengths required is minimized. We present two heuristics, the shortest path heuristic (SPT) and the lambda path heuristic (LPH), a tabu search meta-heuristic (TS), and an ILP formulation. We show that TS provides results close to the optimal solution (from the ILP) for small networks. We then show that TS provides a 10% improvement over LPH and a 30%40% improvement over SPT for various realistic networks. © 2010 OSA.","Heuristics; ILP; Manycast; Multicast; RWA; Tabu search; Wavelength routing; WDM","Heuristics; ILP; Manycast; Multicasts; RWA; Wavelength routing; WDM; Integer programming; Multicasting; Wavelength; Tabu search","Charbonneau, N.; Department of Computer and Information Science, , Dartmouth, MA, United States; email: vvokkarane@ieee.org",,,19430620,,,,"English","J.of Opt.

In particular, loading of P on land in fertilizer applications is a global water quality concern. The Lake Winnipeg Basin (LWB) is a major agricultural area displaying extreme eutrophication. We examined the eutrophication problem in the context of the reemerging global concern about future accessibility of phosphate rock for fertilizer production and sustainable phosphorus management. An exploratory action research participatory design was applied to study options for proactivity within the LWB. The multiple methods, including stakeholder interviews and surveys, demonstrate emerging synergies between the goals of reversing eutrophication and promoting food security. Furthermore, shifting the prevalent pollutant-driven eutrophication management paradigm in the basin toward a systemic, holistic and ecocentric approach, integrating global resource challenges, requires a mutual learning process among stakeholders in the basin to act on and adapt to ecosystem vulnerabilities. It is suggested to continue aspects of this research in a transdisciplinary format, i.e., science with society, in response to globally-expanding needs and concerns, with a possible focus on enhanced engagement of indigenous peoples and elders. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Action research; Eutrophication; Indigenous; Lake Winnipeg; Nutrient management; Phosphorus; Water management","Agriculture; Fertilizers; Food supply; Lakes; Phosphorus; Water management; Water quality; Action research; Agricultural productions; Eutrophication control; Fertilizer applications; Fertilizer production; Indigenous; Lake Winnipeg; Nutrient management; Eutrophication; phosphate fertilizer; phosphorus; action research; eutrophication; nutrient dynamics; phosphorus; pollution control; sustainable development; water management; Article; Canada; conceptual framework; environmental management; eutrophication; exploratory research; food availability; food security; interview; lake ecosystem; methodology; motivation; priority journal; river basin; sustainable agriculture; sustainable development; water pollutant; water quality; Canada; Lake Winnipeg; Manitoba","Ulrich, A.E.; Institute for Environmental Decisions (IED), Universitätsstrasse 22, Switzerland; email: andrea.ulrich@env.ethz.ch",,"Elsevier",00489697,,STEVA,,"English","Sci.

Both requirements are met by the respective outcomes of ontological and knowledge engineering initiatives. In this paper we discuss a novel, knowledge-based approach to resource synthesis (service composition), which draws on the functionality of semantic web services to represent and expose available resources. The approach we use exploits domain knowledge to guide the service composition process and provide advice on service selection and instantiation. The approach has been implemented in a prototype workflow construction environment that supports the runtime recommendation of a service solution, service discovery via semantic service descriptions, and knowledge-based configuration of selected services. The use of knowledge provides a basis for full automation of service composition via conventional planning algorithms. Workflows produced by this system can be executed through a domain-specific direct mapping mechanism or via a more fluid approach such as WSDL-based service grounding. The approach and prototype have been used to demonstrate practical benefits in the context of the Geodise initiative [2]. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,"Knowledge based systems; Problem solving; Quality of service; Semantic Web; Social networking (online); Websites; Construction environment; Domain-specific knowledge; Inter-agent communications; Knowledge-based approach; Semantic service composition; Semantic service descriptions; Service composition process; Web service technology; Web services","Chen, L.; Department of Electronics and Computer Science, , Highfield, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom; email: lc@ecs.soton.ac.uk","Fensel D.Sycara K.Mylopoulos J.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783540203629,,,"English","Lect.

This price is evidently even higher when common modeling routines such as calibration and uncertainty analysis are involved. Likewise, methods and techniques for reducing computation time in large scale socio-environmental modeling software is growing. Recent advancements in distributed computing such as Grid infrastructure have provided further opportunity to this effort. In the interest of gaining computational efficiency, we developed generic tools and techniques for enabling the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model application to run on the EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-science projects in Europe) Grid. Various program components/scripts were written to split a large scale hydrological model of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to submit the split models to the Grid, and to collect and merge results into single output format. A three-step procedure was applied to take advantage of the Grid. Firstly, a python script was run in order to split the SWAT model into several sub-models. Then, individual sub-models were submitted in parallel for execution on the Grid. Finally, the outputs of the sub-basins were collected and the reach routing process was performed with another script executing a modified SWAT program. We conducted experimental simulations with multiple temporal and spatial scale hydrological models on the Grid infrastructure. Results showed that, in spite of computing overheads, parallel computation of socio-environmental models on the Grid is beneficial for model applications especially with large spatial and temporal scales. In the end, we conclude by recommending methods for further reducing computational overheads while running large scale model applications on the Grid. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Distributed computing; Grid computing; Gridification; Hydrological models; SWAT","Computation time; Computational demands; Computational overheads; Distributed computations; e-Science; Experimental simulations; Grid infrastructures; Gridification; High resolution; Hydrological models; Large scale hydrological model; Large-scale models; Model application; Modeling softwares; Parallel Computation; Program components; Routing process; Soil and water assessment tool; Spatial scale; Subbasins; Submodels; SWAT; SWAT model; Temporal scale; Tools and techniques; Data processing; Distributed computer systems; Hydrology; Telecommunication networks; Uncertainty analysis; Grid computing; calibration; environmental modeling; hydrological modeling; parallel computing; software; spatial resolution; uncertainty analysis","Yalew, S.; UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, PO Box 3015, 2601 DA, Delft, Netherlands; email: seleshiget@gmail.com",,,13648152,,EMSOF,,"English","Environ.

To ensure the correctness of grid workflow specification and execution, grid workflow verification and validation must be conducted. However, current research on grid workflow verification and validation is at the infancy stage and very few projects focus on them. Therefore, a systematic investigation and an overall classification of key issues in grid workflow verification and validation is helpful and should be presented so that we can keep on the right track and reduce unnecessary work as much as possible. As such, in this paper, we analyse the grid workflow verification and validation and present a taxonomy. Especially, we identify some important open points which are not discussed by the current research and hence need further investigation. The taxonomy is aimed at providing an overall picture of grid workflow verification and validation.

At the same time user applications have become more and more complex. Often, they consist of a diverse collection of software components, and need to handle variable workloads, which poses different requirements on the infrastructure. Therefore, many organisations are considering using a combination of different clouds to satisfy these needs. It raises, however, a non-trivial issue of how to select the best combination of clouds to meet the application requirements. This paper presents a novel algorithm to deploy workflow applications on federated clouds. First, we introduce an entropy-based method to quantify the most reliable workflow deployments. Second, we apply an extension of the Bell-LaPadula Multi-Level security model to address application security requirements. Finally, we optimise deployment in terms of its entropy and also its monetary cost, taking into account the cost of computing power, data storage and inter-cloud communication. We implemented our new approach and compared it against two existing scheduling algorithms: Extended Dynamic Constraint Algorithm (EDCA) and Extended Biobjective dynamic level scheduling (EBDLS). We show that our algorithm can find deployments that are of equivalent reliability but are less expensive and meet security requirements. We have validated our solution through a set of realistic scientific workflows, using well-known cloud simulation tools (WorkflowSim and DynamicCloudSim) and a realistic cloud based data analysis system (e-Science Central). © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Cloud computing; cost; reliability; scheduling; security; workflow","Cloud computing; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Cryptography; Digital storage; Entropy; Network security; Reliability; Scheduling; Application requirements; Dynamic level scheduling; Entropy-based methods; Multi-level security models; security; Security requirements; workflow; Workflow applications; Scheduling algorithms",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers",19391374,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

The emergence of a service-oriented view of hardware and software resources raises the question as to how database management systems and technologies can best be deployed or adapted for use in such an environment. This paper explores one aspect of service-based computing and data management, viz., how to integrate query processing technology with a service-based architecture suitable for a Grid environment. The paper addresses this by describing in detail the design and implementation of a service-based distributed query processor. The query processor is service-based in two orthogonal senses: firstly, it supports querying over data storage and analysis resources that are made available as services, and, secondly, its internal architecture factors out as services the functionalities related to the construction and execution of distributed query plans. The resulting system both provides a declarative approach to service orchestration, and demonstrates how query processing can benefit from a service-based architecture. As well as describing and motivating the architecture used, the paper also describes usage scenarios, and, using a bioinformatics application, presents performance results that benchmark the system and illustrate the benefits provided by the service-based architecture. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

With the rise of individual online activity in chat rooms, social networking sites and micro-blogging services, new repositories for social science research have become available in large quantities. Given the changes of scale that accompany such research, both in terms of data mining and the communication of results, the authors term this type of research 'massified research'. This article argues that while the private and commercial processing of these new massive data sets is far from unproblematic, the use by academic practitioners poses particular challenges with respect to established ethical protocols. These involve reconfigurations of the external relations between researchers and participants, as well as the internal relations that compose the identities of the participant, the researcher and that of the data. Consequently, massified research and its outputs operate in a grey area of undefined conduct with respect to these concerns. The authors work through the specific case study of using Twitter's public Application Programming Interface for research and visualization. To conclude, this article proposes some potential best practices to extend current procedures and guidelines for such massified research. Most importantly, the authors develop these under the banner of 'agile ethics'. The authors conclude by making the counterintuitive suggestion that researchers make themselves as vulnerable to potential data mining as the subjects who comprise their data sets: a parity of practice. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","data intensity; e-science; ethics; social media platforms; Twitter; visualization",,"Webmoor, T.; Institute for Science, Innovation and Society, Park End Street, Oxford, OX1 1HP, United Kingdom; email: timwebmoor@gmail.com",,,1369118X,,,,"English","Inf.

These scientific workflows are defined, executed, and monitored by scientific workflow management systems (SWfMS). As these experiments manage large amounts of data, it becomes critical to execute them in high-performance computing environments, such as clusters, grids, and clouds. However, few SWfMS provide parallel support. The ones that do so are usually labor-intensive for workflow developers and have limited primitives to optimize workflow execution. To address these issues, we developed workflow algebra to specify and enable the optimization of parallel execution of scientific workflows. In this paper, we show how the workflow algebra is efficiently implemented in Chiron, an algebraic based parallel scientific workflow engine. Chiron has a unique native distributed provenance mechanism that enables runtime queries in a relational database. We developed two studies to evaluate the performance of our algebraic approach implemented in Chiron; the first study compares Chiron with different approaches, whereas the second one evaluates the scalability of Chiron. By analyzing the results, we conclude that Chiron is efficient in executing scientific workflows, with the benefits of declarative specification and runtime provenance support.

We further describe our approaches to querying for different forms of provenance in Karma in the context of queries in the first provenance challenge. We use an incremental, building-block method to construct provenance queries based on the fundamental querying capabilities provided by the Karma service centered on the provenance data model. This has the advantage of keeping the Karma service generic and simple, and yet supports a wide range of queries. Karma successfully answers all but one challenge query.

Lack of coordination exacerbates the utilization of various resources including computing cycles and network bandwidth. Moreover, current brokering systems have evolved around centralized client/server or hierarchical models. The responsibilities of the key functionalities such as resource discovery are delegated to the centralized server machines. Centralized models have well-known drawbacks regarding scalability, single point of failure, and network congestion at links leading to the server. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a novel approach for decentralized and cooperative workflow scheduling in a dynamic and distributed Grid resource sharing environment. The participants in the system, such as the workflow brokers, resources, and users who belong to multiple control domains, work together to enable a single cooperative resource sharing environment. The proposed approach derives from a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based d-dimensional logical index space with regard to resource discovery, coordination and overall system decentralization. The DHT-based d-dimensional index space serves as a blackboard system, where distributed participants can post and search complex coordination objects that regulate system wide scheduling decision making. With the implementation of our approach, not only the performance bottlenecks are likely to be eliminated but also efficient scheduling with enhanced scalability will be achieved. We evaluate and prove the feasibility of our approach through an extensive trace-driven simulation. In order to show the performance of the proposed approach against non-cooperative scheduling approach, we conduct experiment for different sizes of workflow. The results show that our scheduling technique can reduce the makespan up to 25% and demonstrates improved load balancing capability. We also compare the performance of the proposed approach against a centralized coordination technique and show that our approach is as efficient as the centralized technique with respect to achieving coordinated schedules.

It makes it possible to treat neural systems as stochastic communication channels and gain valuable, quantitative insights into their sensory coding function. These techniques provide results on how neurons encode stimuli in a way which is independent of any specific assumptions on which part of the neuronal response is signal and which is noise, and they can be usefully applied even to highly non-linear systems where traditional techniques fail. In this article, we describe our work and experiences using Python for information theoretic analysis. We outline some of the algorithmic, statistical and numerical challenges in the computation of information theoretic quantities from neural data. In particular, we consider the problems arising from limited sampling bias and from calculation of maximum entropy distributions in the presence of constraints representing the effects of different orders of interaction in the system. We explain how and why using Python has allowed us to significantly improve the speed and domain of applicability of the information theoretic algorithms, allowing analysis of data sets characterized by larger numbers of variables.

This was illustrated for the tragic case of 4 November 2011, when Genoa, Italy, was flooded as the result of heavy, convective precipitation that inundated the Bisagno catchment. The Meteorological Model Bridge (MMB), an innovative software component developed within the DRIHM project for the interoperability of meteorological and hydrological models, is a key component of the DRIHM e-Science environment. The MMB allowed three different rainfall-discharge models (DRiFt, RIBS and HBV) to be driven by four mesoscale limited-area atmospheric models (WRF-NMM, WRF-ARW, Meso-NH and AROME) and a downscaling algorithm (RainFARM) in a seamless fashion. In addition to this multi-model configuration, some of the models were run in probabilistic mode, thus giving a comprehensive account of modelling errors and a very large amount of likely hydrometeorological scenarios (> 1500). The multi-model approach proved to be necessary because, whilst various aspects of the event were successfully simulated by different models, none of the models reproduced all of these aspects correctly. It was shown that the resulting set of simulations helped identify key atmospheric processes responsible for the large rainfall accumulations over the Bisagno basin. The DRIHM e-Science environment facilitated an evaluation of the sensitivity to atmospheric and hydrological modelling errors. This showed that both had a significant impact on predicted discharges, the former being larger than the latter. Finally, the usefulness of the set of hydrometeorological simulations was assessed from a flash flood early-warning perspective. © Author(s) 2015.",,"atmospheric modeling; downscaling; ensemble forecasting; flash flood; hydrological modeling; hydrometeorology; precipitation (climatology); Genoa; Genova; Italy; Liguria; Hepatitis B virus","Hally, A.; CNRM-GAME (Météo-France CNRS)France",,"Copernicus GmbH",15618633,,,,"English","Nat.

With increasing amounts of data being collected from intelligent transportation system sensors, data-driven or data-based research is expected to expand soon. Most online systems are designed to handle one type of data, such as from freeway or arterial sensors. Even if transportation data are ubiquitous, data usability is difficult to improve. A framework is proposed for a regionwide web-based transportation decision system that adopts digital roadway maps as the base and provides data layers for integrating multiple data sources (e.g., traffic sensor, incident, accident, and travel time). This system, called the Digital Roadway Interactive Visualization and Evaluation Network (DRIVE Net), provides a practical method for facilitating data retrieval and integration and enhances data usability. Moreover, DRIVE Net offers a platform for optimizing transportation decisions that also serves as an ideal tool for visualizing historical observations spatially and temporally.

We define a Gaggle as a modest number of managed and actively interacting Grid/Web Services, where services are put together for particular functionality. The information management requirements in Gaggles include both the management of large amounts of relatively static services and associated semantic information as well as the management of multiple dynamic regions (sessions or subgrids) where the semantic information is changing frequently. We design a hybrid, fault tolerant, and high performance Information Service supporting both the scalability of large amounts of relatively slowly varying data and a high performance rapidly updated Information Service for dynamic regions. We use the two Web Service standards: Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration (UDDI) and Web Services Context (WS-Context). We evaluate our approach by applying various tests to investigate the performance and sustainability of the centralized version of our implementation that is applied to sensor and collaboration grids. The experimental study on system responsiveness of the proposed approach shows promising results. This study indicates that communication among services can be achieved with efficient centralized metadata strategies, with metadata coming from more than two services. In contrast point-to-point methodologies provide service conversation with metadata only from the two services that exchange information. In addition, our performance indicates that efficient mediator services also allow us to perform collective operations such as queries on subsets of all available metadata in service conversation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Lessons about collaboration are extracted from the findings of two large, long-term digital library research projects. Both the Alexandria Digital Earth Prototype Project (ADEPT) and the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing (CENS) project on data management leverage scientific research data for use in teaching. Two forms of collaboration were studied: (1) direct, in which faculty work together on research projects; and (2) indirect or serial, in which faculty use or contribute content to a common pool, such as teaching resources, concepts and relationships, or research data. Five aspects of collaboration in e-Research are discussed: (1) disciplinary factors, (2) incentives to adopt e-Learning and e-Research technologies, (3) user roles, (4) information sharing, and (5) technical requirements. Collaboration varied by research domain in both projects, and appears partly to be a function of the degree of instrumentation in data collection. Faculty members were more interested in tools to manage their own research data than in tools to facilitate teaching. They also were more reflective about their research than teaching activities. The availability of more content, tools, and services to incorporate primary data in teaching was only a minimal incentive to use these resources. Large investments in a knowledge base of scientific concepts and relationships for teaching did not result in re-use by other faculty during the course of the project. Metadata requirements for research and for teaching vary greatly, which further complicates the transfer of resources across applications. Personal digital libraries offer a middle ground between private control and public release of content, which is a promising direction for the design of digital libraries that will facilitate collaboration in e-Research. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Collaboration; Digital libraries; e-Learning; e-Research; e-Science; Human-computer interaction; Information retrieval; Information seeking","Computer aided software engineering; Digital libraries; Embedded systems; Human computer interaction; Information retrieval; Learning systems; Project management; Software prototyping; e-Research; e-Science; Information seeking; Electronic commerce","Borgman, C.L.; Department of Information Studies, University of California, Box 951520, Los Angeles, CA 90095, United States; email: borgman@gseis.ucla.edu",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",09259724,,CSCWE,,"English","Comput Supported Coop Work CSCW Int J",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749568801

To better understand such uncertainties requires statistical analysis and data-intensive computing enabled by cyberGIS (aka geographic information science and systems based on advanced cyberinfrastructure and e-science). Therefore, we have developed a cyberGIS approach to optimize biomass supply chains under uncertainties. Our approach (1) designs optimal biomass supply chains from regional to national scale with flexible spatial selection of study areas; (2) performs uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to quantify how various sources of uncertainty in the biomass supply chain contribute to the variation of optimal results; and (3) provides users with online geodesign features. This approach has been implemented as a decision support system through integration of data management, mathematical modeling, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, and result representation and visualization. An optimization modeling analysis of 7000 scenarios using Monte Carlo methods has been conducted to quantify the uncertainty and sensitivity impact of various input factors on ethanol production costs and optimal biomass supply chain configurations in Illinois, United States. The results from uncertainty analysis showed that the minimal ethanol production costs range from $2.30 to $3.43 gal−1, considering uncertainties from biomass supply, transportation, and processing. The results of sensitivity analysis demonstrated that biomass-ethanol conversion rate was the most influential factor to ethanol production costs while the optimal biomass supply chain infrastructure was sensitive to changes in biomass yield, raw biomass transportation cost, and logistics loss rate. Leveraging high performance computing power through cutting-edge cyberGIS software, what-if scenario analysis has been evaluated to make decisions in case of unexpected events occurring in the supply chain operations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass supply chain; CyberGIS; Geodesign; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Spatial decision support system; Uncertainty","Artificial intelligence; Biomass; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Data visualization; Decision making; Decision support systems; Ethanol; Factor analysis; Geographic information systems; Information management; Monte Carlo methods; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chain management; Transportation; Biomass supply chain; CyberGIS; Geodesign; Spatial decision support systems; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; biomass; cost analysis; decision making; demand-side management; design method; GIS; market conditions; numerical model; optimization; price dynamics; processing; sensitivity analysis; software; supply chain management; transportation; uncertainty analysis; visualization; yield; Illinois; United States","Wang, S.; National Center for Supercomputing Applications, United States; email: Shaowen@illinois.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

In a similar way, scientific workflows can accomplish the automation of large-scale e-Science applications. However, the use of workflows in scientific environments differs from that in business environments. Scientific workflows need to handle large amounts of data, deal with heterogeneous and distributed resources such as the Grid, and require specialized software applications that are written in diverse programming languages, most of which are not popular in business environments. In this paper, we analyze the preparedness and the shortcomings of the SOA paradigm in addressing the needs of e-Science and the extent to which this can be done. The paper identifies the characteristics of a Virtual Organization providing scientific services, and presents a model placing particular emphasis on BPEL processes as a mean for supporting the interaction with Web Services. We discuss the challenges encountered in the seamless integration of BPEL processes within an e-Science infrastructure and we propose a set of complementary infrastructural services. By providing business utilities and automation technology foundedonWeb Services, infrastructural services cooperate with BPEL inensuring on-demand resource provisioning for the execution of scientific workflows, while addressing some critical issues such as security, access control and monitoring. Furthermore, the paper presents our experience in adopting the proposed approach within a collaborative environment for bioinformatics. To illustrate how a scientific experiment can be formalized and executed, we focus on micro-array data processing, a field that will be increasingly common in applications of machine learning to molecular biology. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Major new tools are required and corresponding demands are placed on the high-throughput data generated and used in these processes. Nowhere is the demand greater than in the semantic integration of these data. Semantic Web tools and technologies afford the chance to achieve this semantic integration. Since pathway knowledge is central to much of the scientific research today it is a good test-bed for semantic integration. Within the context of biological pathways, the BioPAX initiative, part of a broader movement towards the standardization and integration of life science databases, forms a necessary prerequisite for its successful application of e-Science in health care and life science research. This paper examines whether BioPAX, an effort to overcome the barrier of disparate and heterogeneous pathway data sources, addresses the needs of e-Science. Results: We demonstrate how BioPAX pathway data can be used to ask and answer some useful biological questions. We find that BioPAX comes close to meeting a broad range of e-Science needs, but certain semantic weaknesses mean that these goals are missed. We make a series of recommendations for re-modeling some aspects of BioPAX to better meet these needs. Conclusion: Once these semantic weaknesses are addressed, it will be possible to integrate pathway information in a manner that would be useful in e-Science. © 2007 Luciano and Stevens; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Biological pathways; Data-sources; High-throughput data; Life science research; Life-sciences; Scientific researches; Semantic integration; Web tools and technologies; Research; Integration; article; bioinformatics; biomedicine; data base; information processing; information technology; medical research; semantics; standardization; web browser; documentation; information dissemination; information retrieval; international cooperation; Internet; metabolism; methodology; natural language processing; organization and management; physiology; protein database; research; review; science; semantics; signal transduction; proteome; Databases, Protein; Documentation; Information Dissemination; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internationality; Internet; Natural Language Processing; Proteome; Research; Science; Semantics; Signal Transduction","Luciano, J.S.; Genetics Department, 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur, Boston, MA 02115, United States; email: jluciano@genetics.med.harvard.edu",,,14712105,,BBMIC,"17493286","English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249860614

It has been argued that e-science research, which makes use of advanced computing tools to share distributed resources via networks, changes the disciplinary nature of research towards greater interdisciplinarity and paves the way for the increasing globalization of research. However, these claims need to be instantiated in concrete research practices. The essay therefore presents three examples of research projects where these two features can be demonstrated. More generally these three projects - in social science hyperlink analysis, high-energy physics, and astronomy - are examples of 'research technologies', which, it has been argued, are often a radical source of innovation. The article describes how the three projects illustrate these arguments about research technologies, but also how this concept is limited as e-science research is still ongoing. The conclusion assesses how the notion of research technologies is useful for understanding how networked computing technologies are changing the current landscape of knowledge production. © SAGE Publications 2008.","Disciplinarity; E-Science; Globalization; Innovation; Research technologies",,"Schroeder, R.; Oxford Internet Institute, 1 St Giles, Oxford OX1 3JS, United Kingdom; email: ralph.schroeder@oii.ox.ac.uk",,,05390184,,,,"English","Soc.

The findings from this study indicate several areas of complementarity. Most often, the inquiry-based practices Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information, Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions, and Developing and Using Models were used to advance culturally responsive instruction and assessment. The use and development of models, in particular, allowed students to explore scientific concepts through families’ funds of knowledge and explain content from Western science and Indigenous Knowledge perspectives. Moreover, students frequently Analyzed and Interpreted Data when interrogating science content in sociopolitical consciousness-raising experiences, such as identifying pollution and asthma incidences in an urban area according to neighborhood location. Specific inquiry-based practices were underutilized when advancing culturally responsive science instruction, though. For example, Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking and Engaging in Argument from Evidence were infrequently encountered. However, culturally responsive engineering-related practices were most often connected with these, and thus, represent potential areas for future complementarity, particularly as the United States embraces the Next Generation Science Standards. In considering innovative directions for advancing equitable science education, several possibilities are discussed in light of the findings of this study.© 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This lecture takes up the question of the distinctiveness of ""digital methods"" for researching Internet cultures. It asks, initially, should the methods of study change, however slightly or wholesale, given the specificity of the new medium? The larger digital methods project thereby engages with ""virtual methods,"" the current, dominant ""e-science"" approach to the study of the Internet, and the consequences for research of importing standard methods from the social sciences in particular. What kinds of contributions are made to digital media studies, and the Internet in particular, when traditional methods are imported from the social sciences and the humanities onto the medium? Which research opportunities are foreclosed? Second, I ask, what kinds of new approaches are worthwhile, given an emphasis on the ""natively digital"" as opposed to digitization? The goal is also to change the focus of humanities and humanities computing away from the opportunities afforded by transforming ink into bits. The effort is to develop the study of natively digital objects (the link, the tag, etc.) and devices (engines and other recommendation machines) that make use of them. After critically reviewing existing approaches to the study of the digital, which largely import method onto the medium, I subsequently propose research strategies that follow the medium. How can one learn from methods in the medium, and repurpose them for social and cultural research? The lecture launches a novel strand of study: digital methods. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Blogosphere; Digital methods; Hyperlink analysis; Internet archive; Social networking sites; Wikipedia",,"Rogers, R.; University of Amesterdam, Turfdraagsterpad 9, 1012 XT Amsterdam, Netherlands; email: rogers@uva.nl",,,19331681,,,,"English","J.

The analysis suggests that the main result of the use of ICTs in sciences is an additional layer of communication, providing heterogeneity on top of established patterns and allowing a recombination of new and established elements.

Next, we report data which allows the examination of e-Research through a variety of traces in order to begin to understand how knowledge in the realm of e-Research has been and is being constructed. These data indicate that e-Research has had a variable impact in different fields of research.

The ability of users to manage their own resources enables provisioning of bandwidth-guaranteed tunnels on demand without the costs associated with conventional managed services offered by network providers. However, building high-performance user-controlled networks has only become feasible in the last few years, as trends in the telecommunications industry have made it possible for users to purchase installed optical fiber and light it using their own premises equipment. Consequently, suitable network management technologies have not yet evolved. In particular, there is presently no means for users to easily provision bandwidth-guaranteed tunnels across multiple independent management domains. In this article we present a user-controlled lightpath management system that addresses this problem. We begin by reviewing the high-level functionality of the system. Then we examine the software architecture.

There is a burgeoning need to support collaborative research in a search for answers to big research questions, to integrate the work of data providers and model developers and to provide more generic systems. We describe the concepts of software design of a framework, designed with these points in mind, which facilitates the integration of point-based agricultural models with methods to interpolate climate data. Our approach allows the inter-working of model and interpolation through Fortran functions that are invoked from a central framework. We advocate that the framework code remains open to collaborators, such that it may be adapted to different classes of application, whilst recognising that some module developers need to retain their control on individual elements of the software. The rationale presented within the paper continues a major move away from the stand-alone programs that still dominate agricultural models and interpolation methods. Secondly, the paper considers how these approaches are extendable to exploit opportunities in the emerging Web Service and Grid context. The emerging technology of the Grid allows geographically distributed resources in hardware, software, data and network to be co-ordinated to meet the needs of ""virtual organisations."" We explore how the modularity of our existing code can be exploited in the Grid environment, whilst noting the pre-requisite of a co-operative culture in which both software developers and data providers seek to deliver services to the widest possible community of users. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It has long been accepted that building research on the foundations laid by other scientists is both effective and efficient. Regrettably, some disciplines, chemistry being one, have been slow to recognise the value of sharing and have thus been reluctant to curate their data and information in preparation for exchanging it. The very significant increases in both the volume and the complexity of the datasets produced has encouraged the expansion of e-Research, and stimulated the development of methodologies for managing, organising, and analysing “big data”. We review the evolution of cheminformatics, the amalgam of chemistry, computer science, and information technology, and assess the wider e-Science and e-Research perspective. Chemical information does matter, as do matters of communicating data and collaborating with data. For chemistry, unique identifiers, structure representations, and property descriptors are essential to the activities of sharing and exchange. Open science entails the sharing of more than mere facts: for example, the publication of negative outcomes can facilitate better understanding of which synthetic routes to choose, an aspiration of the Dial-a-Molecule Grand Challenge. The protagonists of open notebook science go even further and exchange their thoughts and plans. We consider the concepts of preservation, curation, provenance, discovery, and access in the context of the research lifecycle, and then focus on the role of metadata, particularly the ontologies on which the emerging chemical Semantic Web will depend. Among our conclusions, we present our choice of the “grand challenges” for the preservation and sharing of chemical information. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,"Frey, J.G.; Chemistry, University Road, Highfield, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, United Kingdom; email: J.G.Frey@soton.ac.uk",,,03060012,,,,"English","Chem.

However, standard data mining platforms, such as Weka and Orange, involve only their own data mining algorithms in the process of knowledge discovery from local data sources. In contrast, next generation data mining technologies should enable processing of distributed data sources, the use of data mining algorithms implemented as web services, as well as the use of formal descriptions of data sources and knowledge discovery tools in the form of ontologies, enabling automated composition of complex knowledge discovery workflows for a given data mining task. This paper proposes a novel Service-oriented Knowledge Discovery framework and its implementation in a service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS (Orange for Web Services), based on the existing Orange data mining toolbox and its visual programming environment, which enables manual composition of data mining workflows. The new service-oriented data mining environment Orange4WS includes the following new features: simple use of web services as remote components that can be included into a data mining workflow; simple incorporation of relational data mining algorithms; a knowledge discovery ontology to describe workflow components (data, knowledge and data mining services) in an abstract and machine-interpretable way, and its use by a planner that enables automated composition of data mining workflows.

In this paper we describe the requirements we have derived from working across a wide range of e-science projects. In particular, the CARMEN neuroinformatics project has exposed a range of challenges due to a need to analyse and share large volumes of data. We have identified the four key activities required by scientists with whom we work, and designed an integrated system-e-Science Central-to provide them. This exploits three emerging technologies: software as a service to avoid the need for users to deploy and maintain any of their own software; social networking to allow users to collaborate by sharing data, services and workflows in a controlled manner and Cloud computing to provide scalable compute resources. The system can not only be used through any web browser, but also provides an API so that applications can build on the core functionality.

The concept of boundary objects has been demonstrably useful in a variety of research areas; however, the meaning and function of boundary objects is contested. At issue is the relationship between boundary objects that negotiate between perspectives and those that specify across perspectives. In this study the changing nature of boundary objects in cooperative work is related to the dynamics of evolving problem conceptualization, system design, and enactment within cooperative work settings. Design based research on material artifacts produced by an incipient cross-disciplinary research team during their efforts towards negotiating integrated conceptualizations and specifying shared research agendas is used to generate a more comprehensive model of boundary objects through the life of a project. © Springer 2010.","Boundary objects; Cross-disciplinary collaboration; Design based research; EResearch; EScience; Material artifacts","Boundary objects; Collaboration design; Cross-disciplinary; E-research; e-Science; Design; Distributed computer systems; Materials; Research","Pennington, D.

Therefore, the accumulation of knowledge about the earth in various forms and a scientifically correct understanding of the earth are necessary. The authors have been leading the ""Global Earth Observation (GEO) Grid"" project since 2005, which is primarily aimed at providing an e-Science infrastructure for the worldwide earth sciences community. In the community, there are wide varieties of existing datasets including satellite imagery, geological data, and ground sensed data that each data owner insists own licensing policy. Also, there are so many related projects that will be configured as a virtual organization (VO) enabled by Grid technology. The GEO Grid is designed to integrate all of the relevant data virtually, again enabled by Grid technology, and is accessible as a set of services. In this paper, first we describe design principles of the GEO Grid that are determined based on accommodating users requirements for publishing, managing, and using data. Second, software architecture and its preliminary implementations are specified where we take the Grid computing and Web service technologies as the core components that comply with a standard set of technologies and protocols. In addition, GEO Grid has been recognized to contribute to GEO or Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) as a part of the Japanese government's commitment. © 2008 IEEE.","Database federation; Earth observation; Global Earth Observation (GEO) Grid; Virtual organization (VO)",,"Sekiguchi, S.; Grid Technology Research Center, , Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058568, Japan; email: sekiguchi@m.aist.go.jp",,,19328184,,,,"English","IEEE Syst.

After an experiment has been executed, it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution was performed correctly or is compatible with some existing experimental criteria or standards, not necessarily anticipated prior to execution. Scientists may also want to review and verify experiments performed by their colleagues. There are no existing frameworks for validating such experiments in today's e-science systems. Users therefore have to rely on error checking performed by the services, or adopt other ad hoc methods. This paper introduces a platform-independent framework for validating workflow executions. The validation relies on reasoning over the documented provenance of experiment results and semantic descriptions of services advertised in a registry. This validation process ensures experiments are performed correctly, and thus results generated are meaningful. The framework is tested in a bioinformatics application that performs protein compressibility analysis. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Overall, findings indicated that students had positive attitudes towards the use of technology for learning, regardless of their various personal characteristics such as gender, age, grade level, previous experience, and content area of interest. In addition, students at lower grades tended to have more satisfaction in using technology compared to the higher graders.

It also focuses on the matching analysis between the course content and the responsibilities as well as requirements of scientific data specialists. Moreover, in order to provide some indications for LIS education of scientific data specialists in China, it presents the training objectives and modes. Design/methodology/approach: Some job portals for librarians and the comprehensive job portals are investigated as information sources and the keywords such as ""scientific data management"", ""data service"", ""data curation"", ""e-Science"", ""e-Research"", ""data specialist"" are selected to retrieval library-released job advertisements for scientific data specialists to understand the library's requirements towards scientific data specialists' core capabilities. Meanwhile the course catalogues of all iSchools' web sites are searched directly in order to find if scientific data courses are provided. Findings: Libraries value teamwork ability, communication ability, interpersonal ability and a good use of data curation tools as the core competences for scientific data specialists. Candidates who possess a second advanced degree, who understand libraries, who hold demonstrated knowledge of metadata standards, and who emphasize details, under the same condition, are more likely to be considered first. Libraries do not have a unified title for scientific data specialists yet. The current curriculums of iSchools mainly cover research method, data science, data management and data service, data statistic and analysis, data warehouse, information studies and technologies, and so on. Originality/value: This unique study explores some required qualifications of science data specialist surveyed by job openings, including the core skills, position requirements, responsibilities of the job, and some qualifications. It also investigates the related curriculum setting of iSchool universities through course descriptions.

In particular, it allows different components of the challenge workflow to independently record documentation, and for the workflow to be executed in different environments, made possible by an open, well-defined data model and architecture. Another noticeable feature is that we distinguish between the data recorded about what has occurred, process documentation, and the provenance of a data item, which is all that caused the data item to be as it is. In this view, provenance is obtained as the result of a query over process documentation. This distinction allows us to tailor the system to best address the separate requirements of recording and querying documentation. Other notable features include the explicit recording of causal relationships between both events and data items, an interaction-based world model, intensional definition of data items in queries rather than relying on explicit naming mechanisms, and styling of documentation to support non-functional application requirements such as reducing storage costs or ensuring privacy of data. In this paper, we describe how each of these features aid us in answering the challenge's provenance queries.

A virtual research community is a widely dispersed group of researchers and associated scientific instruments working together in a common virtual environment. This new kind of scientific environment, usually addressed as a ""collaboratory"", is based on the availability of high-speed networks and broadband access, advanced virtual tools and Grid-middleware technologies which, altogether, are the elements of the e-Infrastructures. The European Commission has heavily invested in promoting this new way of collaboration among scientists funding several international projects with the aim of creating e-Infrastructures to enable the European Research Area and connect the European researchers with their colleagues based in Africa, Asia and Latin America. In this paper we describe the actual status of these e-Infrastructures and present a complete picture of the virtual research communities currently using them.

REST promises of scalability and simple deployment of Web Services seem to be particularly appealing for Earth and Space Science (ESS) applications. In fact, most of the available solutions for geospatial data sharing, applying standard interoperability specifications, require complex service-oriented infrastructures; these are powerful and extensible environments, but they usually result in difficult to deploy and manage for ESS research teams. Thus, ESS researchers would gain great benefit from an easy way of sharing geo-information using the international interoperability standards. The variety and complexity of geo-information sharing services poses several architectural issues; in fact these services encompass sensor planning and observation, coverages and features publication and retrieving, models and simulations running, data citation and annotation. Consequently, the adoption of a specific architectural style must be carefully evaluated against these specific requirements. In this work we analyse the existing geospatial services from an architectural perspective and investigate their possible RESTful implementation. Particular attention is paid to the OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS). Possible benefits and drawbacks, along with open issues and possible solutions are discussed. Our investigation suggests that REST may fit well to the typical ESS research usage cases. However, the architectural choice (e.g. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) vs REST) will depend on a case-by-case analysis. Other important factors must be considered, such as the application context: a valuable example in point are the e-Business and e-Government application scenarios which require message based solutions–like those implemented by SOAP. In any case, there is a clear need for harmonization and reconciliation of these two approaches. © 2009, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","E-science; Geospatial web services; Rest; Roa; Soa; Wcs",,"Mazzetti, P.; Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis (IMAA), , Tito Scalo, Italy; email: mazzetti@imaa.cnr.it",,,17538947,,,,"English","Int.

The purpose of the workshop, and this collection of papers, is to highlight the opportunities for environmental scientists provided by (primarily) off-lattice methods in the discrete-element family, and to draw on the experiences of research communities in which the use of these methods is more advanced. Applications of these methods may be conceived in a wide range of situations where dynamic processes involve a series of fundamental entities (particles or elements) whose interaction results in emergent macroscale structures. Indeed, the capacity of these methods to reveal emergent properties at the meso- and macroscale, that reflect microscale interactions, is a significant part of their attraction. They assist with the definition of constitutive material properties at scales beyond those at which measurement and theory have been developed, and help us to understand self-organizing behaviours. The paper discusses technical issues including the contact models required to represent collision behaviour, computational aspects of particle tracking and collision detection, and scales at which experimental data are required and choices about modelling style must be made. It then illustrates the applicability of DEM and other forms of individual-based modelling in environmental and related fields as diverse as mineralogy, geomaterials, mass movement and fluvial sediment transport processes, as well as developments in ecology, zoology and the human sciences where the relationship between individual behaviour and group dynamics can be explored using a partially similar methodological framework.","Contact behaviour; Discrete-element models; Emergent properties; Environmental science; Particle interaction",,"Richards, K.; Department of Geography, , Cambridge CB2 3EN, United Kingdom; email: ksr10@cam.ac.uk",,"Royal Society",1364503X,,,"15306416","English","Philos.

A framework for representing such context is developed using three core aspects: dimensions, agents and roles. Dimensions consist of a concept's origins, uses and effects; these are generated by the interaction of human, machine and natural agents, and involve entities with roles developed from method-driven perspectives and epistemic-driven versions. The relationship between these core aspects is explored conceptually and implications for geoscientific ontologies are discussed, including identification of a basic ontological type, the situated concept, whose meaning is defined by its geographical-historical context. Geo-pragmatics should help geoscientists evaluate the scientific merit, and fitness for scientific use, of geoscientific ontologies in emerging e-science initiatives. © 2007 The Authors.

The massive volume and diversity of information and services available have made it difficult to achieve seamless and interoperable e-Science for knowledge-intensive disciplines like TCM. Therefore, information integration and service coordination are two major challenges in e-Science for TCM. We still lack sophisticated approaches to integrate scientific data and services for TCM e-Science. Results: We present a comprehensive approach to build dynamic and extendable e-Science applications for knowledge-intensive disciplines like TCM based on semantic and knowledge-based techniques. The semantic e-Science infrastructure for TCM supports large-scale database integration and service coordination in a virtual organization. We use domain ontologies to integrate TCM database resources and services in a semantic cyberspace and deliver a semantically superior experience including browsing, searching, querying and knowledge discovering to users. We have developed a collection of semantic-based toolkits to facilitate TCM scientists and researchers in information sharing and collaborative research. Conclusion: Semantic and knowledge-based techniques are suitable to knowledge-intensive disciplines like TCM. It's possible to build on-demand e-Science system for TCM based on existing semantic and knowledge-based techniques. The presented approach in the paper integrates heterogeneous distributed TCM databases and services, and provides scientists with semantically superior experience to support collaborative research in TCM discipline. © 2007 Chen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Collaborative research; E-science applications; E-science infrastructures; Information integration; Organizational structures; Service coordination; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Virtual organization; Information technology; Interoperability; Knowledge based systems; Medicine; Query processing; Research; Semantics; Distributed database systems; article; Chinese medicine; computer model; computer prediction; computer program; information processing; information retrieval; knowledge base; medical informatics; reference database; scientist; web browser; computer interface; data base; documentation; factual database; information dissemination; information retrieval; international cooperation; Internet; methodology; natural language processing; review; science; semantics; system analysis; Database Management Systems; Databases, Factual; Documentation; Information Dissemination; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internationality; Internet; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Natural Language Processing; Science; Semantics; Systems Integration; User-Computer Interface","Chen, H.; College of Computer Science, , Hangzhou 310027, China; email: huajunsir@zju.edu.cn",,,14712105,,BBMIC,"17493289","English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249854898

In April 2004, funding for RoboNet-1.0 until July 2007 was approved by PPARC's Science Committee, and the project commenced in earnest in August 2004. The search for cool extra-solar planets by optimised robotic monitoring of Galactic microlensing events is one of the two core elements of its scientific programme-observations of gamma-ray bursts is the other. During the 2005 observing season, light curves of more than 60 microlensing events have been sampled at regular intervals. One particular event, OGLE-2005-BLG-71, showed an anomaly caused by an extrasolar planet, which constituted the second detection of a planet by microlensing. As a by-product, our dense monitoring during caustic crossing events can resolve the brightness profile of observed source stars, providing an observational test of stellar atmosphere models. Current development work uses e-science to create a fully automated chain linking event monitoring to the detection of anomalies in the microlensing lightcurves that could be indications of planetary companions and on to the triggering of follow-up observations. In order to fully exploit the potential of such a network for detecting exoplanets, it will be necessary to complement the existing RoboNet with additional telescopes in the southern hemisphere. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Underrepresented students are defined as Blacks, Hispanics, and Indians. While these groups will soon comprise 30% or more of the population, they receive only 5% of the S & E (Science and Engineering) doctorates. The research was completed under NSF (National Science Foundation) grant no. REC 9908861. The research built on a previous NSF study (RED-9355867) that identified the most effective colleges and universities in the country in the preparation of Black, Hispanic, and Indian science and engineering students for study toward the PhD degree. One of the maj or concerns raised during the site visits to the top 10 institutions serving these groups was the loss of capable students to other careers. The study obtained information from minority graduates about factors impacting persistence to graduate studies in science and engineering and solicited suggestions for attracting more people like themselves to S & E doctoral study. Twelve underrepresented minority S & E graduates who decided to forego doctoral study in favor of other pursuits. Themes emerging from these conversations regarding reluctance to pursue advanced study included the following: concern for ability to finance such study; weaknesses in advisement practices and systems; lack of full knowledge, early on, about the rewards of doctoral employment; and concern about opportunities for employment after graduation. Suggestions proffered for attracting more underrepresented minorities to S & E doctoral study included the following: early socialization of youngsters into the world of science and its practice; expanded funding for scholarships and fellowships; expanded outreach by colleges and universities; expanded efforts by churches and community groups and deeper commitments by colleges and universities. © 2001 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",,,,,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",10590145,,,,"English","J.

Researchers face the challenge of collecting, evaluating and integrating large amounts of diverse information to compose and evaluate a hypothesis. Confronted with rapidly accumulating data, researchers currently do not have the software tools to undertake the required information integration tasks. Results: We present HyQue, a Semantic Web tool for querying scientific knowledge bases with the purpose of evaluating user submitted hypotheses. HyQue features a knowledge model to accommodate diverse hypotheses structured as events and represented using Semantic Web languages (RDF/OWL). Hypothesis validity is evaluated against experimental and literature-sourced evidence through a combination of SPARQL queries and evaluation rules. Inference over OWL ontologies (for type specifications, subclass assertions and parthood relations) and retrieval of facts stored as Bio2RDF linked data provide support for a given hypothesis. We evaluate hypotheses of varying levels of detail about the genetic network controlling galactose metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to demonstrate the feasibility of deploying such semantic computing tools over a growing body of structured knowledge in Bio2RDF. Conclusions: HyQue is a query-based hypothesis evaluation system that can currently evaluate hypotheses about the galactose metabolism in S. cerevisiae. Hypotheses as well as the supporting or refuting data are represented in RDF and directly linked to one another allowing scientists to browse from data to hypothesis and vice versa.

In this paper, we discuss opportunities and challenges in the Grid resource management infrastructure and network control plane design, critical to the provision of network-assisted extensible Grid services on the metropolitan scale. Such services can empower a real high performance distributed computing system built on optical transport networks, administered within a single domain and offering plenty of cheap bandwidth to e-science applications. This approach makes the transport infrastructure the main enabling factor of a novel Grid vision, the ""Metropolitan Area Grid"" (MAG), aiming at unifying many geographically distributed federated computational and storage resources into a common ""virtual site"" abstraction, so that they can cooperate as if they were in the same Server Farm and Local Area Network. Simply stated, the MAG concept aims to make applications running on our metro Grid infrastructure aware of their complete computational and networking environment and capabilities, and able to make dynamic, adaptive and optimized use of heterogeneous network infrastructures connecting various high-end resources. As a proof of concept, we realized within the SCoPE High Performance Computing environment the prototype of a basic MAG architecture by implementing a novel centralized network resource management service supporting a flexible Grid-application interface and several effective network resource reservation facilities. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The majority of applications running on these production environments can be characterized as massive CPU-intensive batch jobs (or bag-of-tasks), sometimes considered as the killer application for the Grid. A deep understanding of its main workload characteristics is not only necessary for realistic performance evaluation of the existing system, but also crucial to generate new insights into better resource allocation schemes. This paper presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of the workloads on production eScience Grid environments. We focus on second-order statistics and the scaling behavior of main job characteristics, namely job arrivals and job runtimes. A range of autocorrelation structures is identified and analyzed, including pseudoperiodicity, short-range dependence (SRD), and long-range dependence (LRD). We further develop mathematical models that are able to capture these salient properties in the workloads. Workload models, in turn, enable us to quantitatively evaluate the performance impacts of autocorrelations in Grid scheduling. The results indicate that autocorrelations in workloads result in system performance degradation, sometimes the difference can be as large as up to several orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, better performance can be achieved at the Grid level under bursty local background workloads. Such effects of workloads on systems are extensively analyzed and explained. © 2010 IEEE.","Autocorrelation in workloads; Burstiness; Grid computing; Performance evaluation; Workload modeling","Autocorrelation structures; Burstiness; CPU-intensive; Distributed data processing; e-Science; Existing systems; Grid environments; Grid levels; Grid scheduling; Job characteristics; Killer-application; Long range dependence; Orders of magnitude; Performance evaluation; Performance impact; Production environments; Range dependence; Resource allocation schemes; Runtimes; Scaling behavior; Second order statistics; Statistical analysis; System performance degradation; Work-load models; Workload characteristics; Workload modeling; Autocorrelation; Blind source separation; Correlation detectors; Data processing; Magnetic disk storage; Mathematical models; Wavelet transforms; Grid computing","Li, H.; SAP AG-SAP Research, Vincenz-Priessnitz-Strasse 1, Karlsruhe, BW 76131, Germany; email: hui.li@computer.org",,,10459219,,ITDSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Parallel Distrib Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77649272517

In an effort to better link these resources in a unified manner, many lambda-grid networks, which provide end-to-end dedicated optical circuit-switched connections, have been investigated. In this context, we consider the problem of aggregating files from distributed databases at a (grid) computing node over a lambda grid. The challenge is (i) to identify routes (i.e., circuits) in the lambda-grid network along which files should be transmitted and (ii) to schedule the transfers of these files over their respective circuits. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid approach that combines off-line and on-line scheduling. We define the Time-Path Scheduling Problem (TPSP) for off-line scheduling. We prove that TPSP is NP-complete, develop a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation for TPSP, and then propose a greedy approach to solve TPSP because the MILP does not scale well. We compare the erformance of the greedy approach on a few representative lambda-grid network topologies. One key input to the off-line schedule is the file transfer time. Due to dynamics at the receiving end host which is hard to model precisely, the actual file transfer time may vary. We first propose a model for the estimating the file transfer time. Then, we propose on-line reconfiguration algorithms, so that, as files are transferred, the off-line schedule may be modified on-line depending on the amount of time that it actually took to transfer the file. This helps to reduce the total time to transfer all the files, which is an important metric. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we present results on an emulated lambda-grid network testbed. © 2008 IEEE.","Circuit switching; Lambda grid; Large scale data transfers; Routing; Scheduling","Computational complexity; Data transfer; Integer programming; Large scale systems; Linear programming; Scheduling algorithms; Circuit switching; Lambda grid; Large scale data transfers; Mixed integer linear program (MILP); Time-path scheduling problem (TPSP); Distributed computer systems","Banerjee, A.; Department of Computer Science, , Davis, CA 95616, United States; email: banerjea@cs.ucdavis.edu",,,10459219,,ITDSE,,"English","IEEE Trans Parallel Distrib Syst",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-37149006403

During ageing there is a decline in proteasome activity and an increase in aggregated proteins. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of insoluble, unfolded, ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome. We are using a systems biology approach to try and determine the primary event in the decline in proteolytic capacity with age and whether there is in fact a vicious cycle of inhibition, with accumulating aggregates further inhibiting proteolysis, prompting accumulation of aggregates and so on. A stochastic model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been developed using the Systems Biology Mark-up Language (SBML). Simulations are carried out on the BASIS (Biology of Ageing e-Science Integration and Simulation) system and the model output is compared to experimental data wherein levels of ubiquitin and ubiquitinated substrates are monitored in cultured cells under various conditions. The model can be used to predict the effects of different experimental procedures such as inhibition of the proteasome or shutting down the enzyme cascade responsible for ubiquitin conjugation. Results: The model output shows good agreement with experimental data under a number of different conditions. However, our model predicts that monomeric ubiquitin pools are always depleted under conditions of proteasome inhibition, whereas experimental data show that monomeric pools were depleted in IMR-90 cells but not in ts20 cells, suggesting that cell lines vary in their ability to replenish ubiquitin pools and there is the need to incorporate ubiquitin turnover into the model. Sensitivity analysis of the model revealed which parameters have an important effect on protein turnover and aggregation kinetics. Conclusion: We have developed a model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative approach of model building and validation against experimental data. Using SBML to encode the model ensures that it can be easily modified and extended as more data become available. Important aspects to be included in subsequent models are details of ubiquitin turnover, models of autophagy, the inclusion of a pool of short-lived proteins and further details of the aggregation process. © 2007 Proctor et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"proteasome; ubiquitin; ubiquitin protein ligase; aging; animal; article; biological model; cell strain 3T3; CHO cell; computer simulation; Cricetulus; drug antagonism; genetics; hamster; homeostasis; human; metabolism; mouse; protein folding; tumor cell line; Aging; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; CHO Cells; Computer Simulation; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; Homeostasis; Humans; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Mice; Models, Biological; NIH 3T3 Cells; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Protein Folding; Ubiquitin; Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes","Proctor, C.J.; School of Clinical and Medical Sciences-Gerontology, , Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom; email: c.j.proctor@ncl.ac.uk",,,17520509,,,"17408507","English","BMC Syst.

A combined theoretical framework integrating institutional theory and theory of planned behavior was used to create a research model which presents how scientists make the decision to share data in diverse ways, and how the data sharing factors differ across diverse data sharing behaviors. A survey method was employed to evaluate the research model by using multivariate regression analysis technique with a total of 2172 survey responses in the U.S. The results of this research show the dynamic relationships between diverse data sharing factors and different forms of data sharing behaviors. For data sharing via data repository, journal pressure, perceived effort, and availability of data repositories are significant factors; for data sharing through journal supplement, journal pressure, perceived career benefit, perceived effort, and availability of data repository are significant factors; for personal data sharing, funding agency pressure, normative pressure, perceived career risk, perceived effort, and availability of data repositories are significant factors. This research suggests that funding agencies, journal publishers, and scientific communities that different strategies need to be employed to promote different forms of data sharing behaviors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cyberinfrastructure; Data repository; Data reuse; Data sharing; e-Science; Institutional theory","Multivariant analysis; Regression analysis; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Cyber infrastructures; Data repositories; Data reuse; Data Sharing; E-sciences; Institutional theory; Decision theory",,,"Elsevier Ltd",03064573,,IPMAD,,"English","Inf.

The educational options analysed differ in level (i.e. university versus professional college) and fields of study (i.e. science versus non-science). First we analyse students' self-assessed success probabilities for specific tracks in higher education. We hypothesize that differences in demonstrated academic ability explain these perceived success probabilities. Next, we test whether these success probabilities contribute to explaining educational decisions and differentials herein with respect to social background, sex, and ethnicity. We use the Dutch Participation in Higher Education dataset wave 1995 and 1997 to answer our questions. Success probabilities differ across social origins, between men and women, and across ethnic groups, even after controlling for ability differences. Success probabilities contribute to the explanatory model for school transition decisions which differ by field of study and level of schooling. They also help to explain social origin and sex-based differentials in field choice, but not in level choice. Ability is not a sufficient indicator for self-perceived success probabilities: success probabilities explain educational differentials better than ability. © 2009 The Author.",,,"Tolsma, J.; Department of Sociology, P.O.

Recent advances of employing virtual machines for Grid computing can help Grid communities to solve research issues, for example, qualities of service (QoS) provision and computing environment customization. The heterogeneous virtualization implementations, however, bring challenges for employing virtual machine as computing resources to build Grid infrastructures. The work proposed in this paper focuses on building a Web service based virtual machine provider for Grid infrastructures. The Grid Virtualization Engine (GVE) creates an abstract layer between users and underlying virtualization technologies. It implements a scalable distributed architecture in a hierarchical flavor. The GVE Site Service provides Web service interfaces for users to operate virtual machines, thereafter building Grid infrastructures. The underlying GVE Agent Service talks with different virtualization products inside the computing center and provides virtual machine resources to the GVE Site Service. The GVE is designed and implemented with the state of the arts of distributed computing technologies: Web service and Grid standards. The GVE is evaluated with CMS benchmark, a high-energy physics application from CERN. In addition to the GVE design and implementation, this paper also uses a real example to illustrate how to apply the GVE to build an e-Science infrastructure at runtime.

But what aspect of masculine work contexts is most threatening to women's gender identity at work: A numerical majority of male colleagues (i.e., numerical male dominance), working in a profession in which women are negatively stereotyped (i.e., normative male dominance), or the combination? The current study aimed to disentangle these two aspects of masculine work contexts by testing its combined impact on the experience of gender identity threat among women and men who work in the STEM sector (i.e., Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). A field study was conducted among women (N = 177) and men (N = 630) graduates holding an academic degree in a STEM educational program. Respondents either worked in- or outside the STEM sector (i.e., stronger vs. weaker gender stereotype) and estimated the ratio of men to women in their direct work environment. Results from a Structural Equation Model demonstrated that women in STEM face double trouble: The combination of working almost solely with male colleagues (being outnumbered) and working in the technical sector (where women are negatively stereotyped) predicted the highest levels of experienced gender identity threat, particularly among women who highly identified with their gender group. Gender identity threat, in turn, negatively predicted women's work engagement and career confidence. Men did not face double trouble: Their experience of gender identity threat was not related to working in a masculine STEM sector. Importantly, considering that the women in this sample already hold a degree in STEM, and have proven their competence in STEM and resilience to gender stereotypes, this research reveals how in naturalistic work settings, prevailing social identity threats continue to affect women's professional careers. © 2019 van Veelen, Derks and Endedijk.","Career confidence; Gender (under)representation; Gender identification; Masculine work contexts; Science Technology Engineering Math (STEM); Social identity threat; Work engagement",,"van Veelen, R.; Social, Netherlands; email: r.vanveelen@uu.nl",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",16641078,,,,"English","Front.

However, data offered by DaaS are constrained by several data concerns that, if not automatically being reasoned properly, will lead to a wrong way of using them. In this paper, we support the view that data concerns should be explicitly modelled and specified in data contracts to support concern-aware data selection and utilisation. We perform a detailed analysis of current techniques for data contracts in the cloud. Instead of relying on a specific representation of data contracts, we introduce an abstract model for data contracts that can be used to build different types of data contracts for specific types of data. Based on the abstract model, we propose several techniques for evaluating data contracts that can be integrated into data service selection and composition frameworks. We also illustrate our approach with some real-world scenarios and show how data contracts can be integrated into data agreement exchange services in the cloud.

Furthermore, little is known in the way of design strategies to support such collaboration. This paper presents findings from an investigation into requirements for collaboration in e-science in the context of CiteSeer, a search engine and digital library of research literature in the computer and information science disciplines. Based on a survey and follow-up interviews with CiteSeer users, we present four novel implications for designing the CiteSeer collaboratory. First, visualize query-based social networks to identify scholarly communities of interest. Second, provide online collaborative tool support for upstream stages of scientific collaboration. Third, support activity awareness for staying cognizant of online scientific activities. Fourth, use notification systems to convey scientific activity awareness. We discuss how these implications can broadly enhance e-science usability for collaboratory infrastructures based on digital libraries. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 316 researchers of the region answered an online survey during the last 2 months of 2011. Findings confirm an optimistic attitude through e-Research and an often use of e-Tools to do research. Even though, most of them informed to use basic e-Tools (e.g. e-mail, commercial videoconference, office software and social networks) instead of advanced technologies to process huge amount of data (e.g. Grid, simulation software and Internet2) or the incorporation to Virtual Research Communities. Some of the researchers said that they had an «intensive» (31%) and «often» (53%) use of e-Tools, but only 22% stated that their computer capacity was not enough to manage and process data.

Emphasis is placed on the importance of data analysis methods, with a description of traditional techniques, including the advantages and limitations of linear and non-linear methods to generate layouts that emphasize similarity/dissimilarity relationships among data instances. Particularly important are recent methods that allow processing high-dimensional data, thus taking full advantage of the capabilities of modern equipment. In this area, now referred to as e-science, the choice of appropriate data analysis methods is crucial to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors and biosensors. Two types of systems deserving attention in this context are electronic noses and electronic tongues, which are made of sensor arrays whose electrical or electrochemical responses are combined to provide ''finger print'' information for aromas and tastes. Examples will also be given of unprecedented detection of tropical diseases, made possible with the use of multidimensional projection techniques.

A satisfactory level of agreement between experiment and theory, and hence establishment of the best model to describe the redox chemistry of FAD, was achieved with the aid of automated e-science tools. Although still not perfect, use of Marcus theory with a very low reorganization energy (≤0.3 eV) best mimics the experimental FTACV data, which suggests that the process is gated as also deduced from analysis of FTACV data obtained at different frequencies. Failure of the simplest models to fully describe the electrode kinetics of the redox center of GlcOx, including those based on the widely employed Laviron theory is demonstrated, as is substantial kinetic heterogeneity of FAD species. Use of a SWCNT support amplifies the kinetic heterogeneity, while a combination of rGO and MWCNT provides a more favorable environment for fast communication between FAD and the electrode. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,"Computer simulation; Glucose oxidase; Glucose sensors; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Carbon electrode; Different frequency; Electrochemical kinetics; Electrode kinetics; Flavin adenine dinucleotide; Redox chemistry; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Reorganization energies; Kinetics; carbon; flavine adenine nucleotide; glucose oxidase; immobilized enzyme; article; Aspergillus niger; chemistry; electrochemistry; electrode; enzymology; kinetics; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; Aspergillus niger; Carbon; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Enzymes, Immobilized; Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide; Glucose Oxidase; Kinetics; Oxidation-Reduction","Simonov, A.N.; School of Chemistry, Monash EResearch Centre, Monash University, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia; email: alexandr.simonov@monash.edu",,"American Chemical Society",07437463,,LANGD,"24571209","English","Langmuir",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84897087009

Yet the XML-based standards for web service descriptions encode only a syntactic representation of the service input and output. The actual meaning of these terms, their formal definitions, and their relationships to other concepts are not represented. This poses challenges for leveraging web services in the development of software capabilities. As the number of services grows and the specificity of users' needs increases, the ability to find an appropriate service for a specific application is strained. In order to overcome this challenge, semantic web services were proposed. For the discovery of web services, semantic web services use ontologies to find matches between user requirements and service capabilities. The computational reasoning afforded by ontologies enables users to find categorizations that weren't explicitly defined. However, there are a number of methodological variants on semantic web service discovery. Based on e-Science, an analog to e-Business, one methodology advocates deep and detailed semantic description of a web service's inputs and outputs. Yet, this methodology predates recent advances in semantic web and provenance research, and it is unclear the extent to which it applies outside of e-Science. We explore this question through a within-subjects experiment and we extend this methodology with current research in provenance, semantic web, and web service standards, developing and empirically evaluating an integrated approach to web service description and discovery. Implications for more advanced web service discovery algorithms and user interfaces are also presented. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Ontology; Provenance; Semantic web service; Web service discovery","Distributed computer systems; Ontology; Semantic Web; User interfaces; Websites; Business to business integration; Enterprise application integration; Provenance; Semantic web service descriptions; Semantic web service discovery; Syntactic representation; Web service description; Web service discovery; Web services","Narock, T.; Marymount University, 1000 Glebe Road, Arlington, VA, 22201, United States; email: tnarock@marymount.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",01679236,,DSSYD,,"English","Decis Support Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906785563

Distinct patterns emerged when research publications were disaggregated by fields [i.e., science and engineering (SE) vs. non-science and engineering (non-SE)] and publishing venues (i.e., domestic vs. international journals). Research publications in SE, especially those published in international journals, depended heavily on all three resources, while research in non-SE depended more on human resources.

We mapped potential distribution patterns under present and future conditions for a community with three trophic levels. We analysed climate-induced changes in the species' distribution patterns and examined possible consequences for the chosen food web. Location: Baltic Sea and northern Europe. Methods: We developed two open-source workflow-based analytical tools: one for ecological niche modelling and another for raster layer comparison to compute the extent and intensity of change in species' potential distributions. Individual ecological niche models were generated under present conditions and then projected into a future climate change scenario (2050) for a food web consisting of a guild of meso-grazers (Idotea spp.), their host algae (Fucus vesiculosus and Fucus radicans) and their fish predator (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We used occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), literature and museum collections, together with five environmental layers at a resolution of 5 and 30 arc-minutes. Results: Habitat suitability for Idotea balthica and Idotea chelipes in the Baltic Sea seems to be mostly determined by temperature and ice cover rather than by salinity. 2050 predictions for all modelled species show a northern/north-eastern shift in the Baltic Sea. The distribution ranges for Idotea granulosa and G. aculeatus are predicted to become patchier in the Baltic than in the rest of northern Europe, where the species will gain more suitable habitats. Main conclusions: For the Baltic Sea, climate-induced changes resulted in a gain of suitable habitats for F. vesiculosus, I. chelipes and I. balthica, whereas lower habitat suitability was predicted for I. granulosa, F. radicans and G. aculeatus. The predicted north-eastern shift of I. balthica and I. chelipes into the distribution area of F. radicans in the Baltic Sea may result in increased grazing pressure. Such additional threats to isolated Baltic populations can lead to a higher extinction risk for the species, especially as climate changes are likely to be very rapid. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Fucus radicans; Fucus vesiculosus; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Idotea; Baltic Sea; Climate change; E-Science; Ecological niche modelling; Food web; Workflows","alga; climate change; extinction risk; food web; future prospect; guild; marine ecosystem; spatial distribution; teleost; trophic level; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Europe; algae; Fucus; Fucus vesiculosus; Gasterosteus aculeatus; Idotea; Idotea baltica; Idotea chelipes; Idotea granulosa","Leidenberger, S.; Department of Biology and Environmental Sciences, Kristineberg 566, Sweden",,,03050270,,JBIOD,,"English","J.

Several technical issues were addressed, including the conjunctive use of desktop tools in MATLAB to avoid license issues in the cloud, integration of Dropbox with Azure for improved usability and 'Drop-and-Compute,' and automated file exchanges between desktop and the cloud. Two scientific use cases are presented in this paper using this service with significant computational speedup. One case is from Arizona, where six plausible alternative conceptual models and a streamflow stochastic model are used to evaluate the impacts of different groundwater pumping scenarios. Another case is from Texas, where a global sensitivity analysis is performed on a regional groundwater availability model.

Attempts to embed large-scale infrastructures into research settings has brought to the fore the necessity of understanding the knowledge, skills and practices of researchers within a variety of disciplines that might use these technologies. In this paper, we consider an approach to gathering requirements through the introduction of various technical interventions for relatively short term periods so that we may come to an understanding their impact on routine work practices. Drawing upon an analysis of the detailed ways in which classicists work with digital images, we discuss the requirements for systems that support them as they collaborate in the interpretation of particular types of images.

The term e-science evolved as a new research field that focuses on collaboration in key areas of science using next generation computing infrastructures (i.e. co-called e-science infrastructures) to extend the potential of scientific computing. During the past years, significant international and broader interdisciplinary research is increasingly carried out by global collaborations that often share a single e-science infrastructure. More recently, increasing complexity of e-science applications that embrace multiple physical models (i.e. multi-physics) and consider a larger range of scales (i.e. multi-scale) is creating a steadily growing demand for world-wide interoperable infrastructures that allow for new innovative types of e-science by jointly using different kinds of e-science infrastructures. But interoperable infrastructures are still not seamlessly provided today and we argue that this is due to the absence of a realistically implementable infrastructure reference model. Therefore, the fundamental goal of this paper is to provide insights into our proposed infrastructure reference model that represents a trimmed down version of ogsa in terms of functionality and complexity, while on the other hand being more specific and thus easier to implement. The proposed reference model is underpinned with experiences gained from e-science applications that achieve research advances by using interoperable e-science infrastructures. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","E-Health; E-Science Infrastructures; Hpc; Htc; Interoperability; Reference Model","Computational simulation; Computing infrastructures; e-Science; E-Science Infrastructures; Ehealth; Global collaboration; Growing demand; Interdisciplinary research; Multi-physics; Multiscales; Physical model; Reference models; Research fields; Scientific computing; Computer science; Interoperability; Simulators; Research","Riedel, M.; Jülich Supercomputing Centre, , Jülich 52425, Germany; email: m.riedel@fz-juelich.de",,,13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450242781

However, if we are to reap the benefits of this potential as part of everyday teaching and learning, we need to explicitly think about and support the work required to set up and run e-Science experiences within any particular educational context. In this paper, we present a framework for identifying and describing the resources, tools and services necessary to move e-Science into the classroom together with examples of these. This framework is derived from previous experiences conducting educational e-Science projects and systematic analysis of the categories of 'hidden work' needed to run these projects. The articulation of resources, tools and services based on these categories provides a starting point for more methodical design and deployment of future educational e-Science projects, reflection on which can also help further develop the framework. It also points to the technological infrastructure from which such tools and services could be built. As such it provides an agenda of work to develop both processes and technologies that would make it practical for teachers to deliver active, and collaborative e-Science learning experiences on a larger scale within and across schools.

Mixed-line-rate (MLR) networks that support lightpaths of different rates such as 10, 40, 100 Gb/s, etc., are being studied to better support the heterogeneous traffic demands. Here, we study the important topic of degraded services in MLR networks, where a service can accept some degradation (i.e., reduction) in bandwidth in case of a failure in exchange for a lower cost, a concept called partial protection. Network operators may wish to support degraded services to optimize network resources and reduce cost. We propose using multipath routing to support degraded services in MLR networks, a problem that has not been studied before and is significantly more challenging than in single-line-rate (SLR) networks. We consider minimum-cost MLR network design (i.e., choosing which transponder rates to use at each node), considering the opportunity to exploit multipath routes to support degraded services. We propose a mixed-integer-linear-program (MILP) solution and a computationally efficient heuristic, and consider two partial-protection models. Our illustrative numerical results show that significant cost savings can be achieved due to partial protection versus full protection and is highly beneficial for network operators. We also note that multipath routing in MLR networks exploits volume discount of higher-line-rate transponders by cost-effectively grooming requests over appropriate line rates to maximize transponder reuse versus SLR. © 2013 IEEE.","Degraded service; mixed-line-rate (MLR) network; multipath routing; optical WDM network; partial protection","Bandwidth; Integer programming; Linear programming; Quality of service; Transponders; Computationally efficient; Degraded service; Heterogeneous traffic; Multi path routing; Optical backbone networks; Optical WDM networks; partial protection; Service provisioning; Cost reduction",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",10636692,,IEANE,,"English","IEEE ACM Trans Networking",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903307011

But it is foolhardy to believe that all human processes, particularly as varied as the scientific discovery process, will be fully automated by a workflow system. Consequently, provenance capture has to be thought of as a problem applied to both human and automated processes. The unmanaged workflow is the full human-driven activity, encompassing tasks whose execution is automated by an orchestration tool, and tasks that are done outside an orchestration tool. In this chapter we discuss the implications of the unmanaged workflow as it affects provenance capture, representation, and use. Illustrations of capture include multiple experiences with unmanaged capture using the Karma tool. Illustrations of use include defining workflows by suggesting additions to workflow designs under construction, reconstructing process traces, and using analysis tools to assess provenance quality. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","Case-based reasoning; Data mining; Data provenance; E-Science workflows; Intelligent user interfaces; Provenance capture",,"Aktas, M.S.; Data to Insight Center, , Bloomington, United States; email: maktas@cs.indiana.edu",,"Springer Verlag",1860949X,9783642299308,,,"English","Stud.

Although atomicity is a well studied topic in transaction processing and business workflows, such an important capability needs to be revisited in a scientific workflow environment. Firstly, the semantics of atomicity needs to be defined in a dataflow-oriented scientific workflow model, particularly for pipelined execution of hierarchical scientific workflows. Secondly, in a scientific workflow environment, atomic regions are specified or inferred dynamically as needed and are committed implicitly, which are in contrast to a priori well-defined transaction boundaries and explicit commits in transaction processing and business workflows. Finally, although atomicity and provenance are related to each other, their interactions and relationships have never been explored in the literature. In this paper, we propose: (i) an architecture for scientific workflow management systems that supports both provenance and atomicity; (ii) a dataflow-oriented atomicity model that supports the notions of commit and abort; and (iii) a dataflow-oriented provenance model that supports querying and visualizing provenance. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, the use of the rectangular window introduces 'ringing noise' (oscillations) into the iFT data, which may mask the faradaic a.c. signal of interest in the higher order harmonics that are available in large amplitude FTACV, while 'bell-shaped' functions may distort the magnitude and shape of the recovered a.c. harmonic components. The application of a new adjustable hybrid window based on the convolution of a rectangular and a Gaussian profile is now introduced to diminish the magnitude of the 'ringing'. The use of such a window is shown to significantly reduce both the amplitude and propagation time of the 'ringing' and, at the same time preserves the magnitude and shape of the recovered harmonic components. These attributes facilitate the accurate recovery of the faradaic signal. The advantages provided by application of the hybrid window when estimating thermodynamic and kinetic parameters from optimised comparisons of experimental and theoretical FTACV data are demonstrated. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While most discourse models have considered the roles of the text features and the reader, the crucial role of writers' epistemic stance has not been widely considered. The thesis explored here is that levels of cohesion emerge in text based on the epistemic stance of the author relative to the reader. Evidence is provided indicating that text genres (i.e. science, narrative) show compensatory relationships between different features related to text difficulty. For example, while science texts have more challenging words than do narratives, they tend to have higher cohesion and simpler syntax. These text profiles indicate that skilled writers have an awareness of readers' needs. By contrast, less skilled writers seem to have less sensitivity to the interplay between textual dimensions and less audience awareness. For example, evidence is reviewed showing that more proficient essays are characterized by lower cohesion than less proficient essays: less skilled writers tend to use more cohesive cues (when they are likely unnecessary) than do more skilled writers. To the extent that an author understands the readers' needs, the author has a more successful epistemic stance toward the reader. This stance is partially evidenced by the crucial role of cohesion in text comprehension and writing. © The Author(s) 2013.","Coherence; cohesion; epistemic stance; reading comprehension; text genre; writing; writing proficiency",,"McNamara, D.

On the one hand, the raison d'être of the projects is to encourage members of their research communities to use the resources provided. On the other hand, the threats to these resources from online attacks require robust and effective security to mitigate the risks faced. This raises two issues: ensuring that (1) the security mechanisms put in place are usable by the different users of the system, and (2) the security of the overall system satisfies the security needs of all its different stakeholders. A failure to address either of these issues can seriously jeopardise the success of e-Science projects. The aim of this paper is to firstly provide a detailed understanding of how these challenges can present themselves in practice in the development of e-Science applications. Secondly, this paper examines the steps that projects can undertake to ensure that security requirements are correctly identified, and security measures are usable by the intended research community. The research presented in this paper is based on four case studies of e-Science projects. Security design traditionally uses expert analysis of risks to the technology and deploys appropriate countermeasures to deal with them. However, these case studies highlight the importance of involving all stakeholders in the process of identifying security needs and designing secure and usable systems. For each case study, transcripts of the security analysis and design sessions were analysed to gain insight into the issues and factors that surround the design of usable security. The analysis concludes with a model explaining the relationships between the most important factors identified.

In such applications, circuits are provisioned for end hosts to accomplish data-intensive or QoS-stringent communication tasks. Existing provisioning methods provide point-to-point connectivity for end hosts, that is, an established circuit connects one end host to another, and during the lifetime of the circuit, only communication tasks between the connected end hosts can be served. This inhibits circuits from being used in more general cases, where each end host communicates with different remote parities simultaneously through a single network interface. We propose V-STONES - a data flow-based VLAN tagging and switching technique to increase the connectivity of end host network interfaces in circuit-switched networks. With V-STONES, not only can an IP end host communicate with different remote systems concurrently through bandwidth guaranteed connections, but also protocol entities at different stack layers can talk to their counterparts through dedicated bandwidth pipes. In this article, we review the existing circuit provisioning methods and then discuss V-STONES and the architecture of cross-layer circuit provisioning for end hosts. We also introduce a prototype implementation in an optical network testbed and present the experimental results. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Bandwidth; Data flow analysis; Fiber optic networks; Internet protocols; Quality of service; User interfaces; Cross-layer optical circuit; End host; Integrated optoelectronics","Sun, W.; Department of Electronic Engineering, , Shanghai, China; email: sunwq@sjtu.edu.cn",,,01636804,,ICOMD,,"English","IEEE Commun Mag",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449153063

At the same time, workflow management systems (WFMS) may support data parallelism over big datasets by providing scalable, distributed deployment and execution of the workflow over a cloud infrastructure. In theory, the combination of these properties makes workflows a natural choice for implementing Big Data processing pipelines, common for instance in bioinformatics. In practice, however, correct workflow design for parallel Big Data problems can be complex and very time-consuming. In this paper we present our experience in porting a genomics data processing pipeline from an existing scripted implementation deployed on a closed HPC cluster, to a workflow-based design deployed on the Microsoft Azure public cloud. We draw two contrasting and general conclusions from this project. On the positive side, we show that our solution based on the e-Science Central WFMS and deployed in the cloud clearly outperforms the original HPC-based implementation achieving up to 2.3× speed-up. However, in order to deliver such performance we describe the importance of optimising the workflow deployment model to best suit the characteristics of the cloud computing infrastructure. The main reason for the performance gains was the availability of fast, node-local SSD disks delivered by D-series Azure VMs combined with the implicit use of local disk resources by e-Science Central workflow engines. These conclusions suggest that, on parallel Big Data problems, it is important to couple understanding of the cloud computing architecture and its software stack with simplicity of design, and that further efforts in automating parallelisation of complex pipelines are required. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; HPC; Performance analysis; Whole-exome sequencing; Workflow-based application","Bioinformatics; Cloud computing; Computation theory; Computer architecture; Data flow analysis; Data handling; Information management; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Software prototyping; Windows operating system; Work simplification; Cloud computing architectures; Cloud computing infrastructures; Data processing pipelines; High-level programming models; Performance analysis; Whole-exome sequencing; Workflow management systems; Workflow-based applications; Big data","Cała, J.; School of Computing Science, United Kingdom; email: Jacek.Cala@ncl.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959191705

In scientific applications, users typically know the data size, the data available time, and the deadline to finish the data transfer, and they always wish to achieve the earliest possible finish time or the minimum time duration for the data transfer. On the other hand, the network service provider wishes to serve as many users’ bandwidth reservation requests (BRRs) as possible to maximize the network resource utilization without compromising their deadlines. Such multi-objective requirements and high system throughput call for a fast and efficient bandwidth reservation strategy that can quickly discover various reservation options in a time-varying network environment. We propose two bandwidth reservation algorithms with rigorous optimality proofs to compute the reservation options with the earliest completion time and with the shortest duration for a local BRR. Our algorithms aim to achieve the balanced resource utilization for the network system. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms in terms of execution time, success ratio, success ratio of BRRs with different priorities and searched complexity of BRRs in comparison with similar scheduling algorithms. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bandwidth scheduling; Dedicated network; High-performance networks","Algorithms; Bandwidth; Complex networks; Data transfer; Scheduling algorithms; Bandwidth scheduling; Dedicated networks; Guaranteed performance; High performance networks; Network resource utilization; Network service providers; Reliable data transfers; Scientific applications; Time varying networks","Zhu, M.M.; Department of Computer Science, Southern Illinois UniversityUnited States",,"Springer New York LLC",10647570,,JNSME,,"English","J Network Syst Manage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84931010655

We describe the details of GOI (including architecture, technology adapters and asynchronous invocations) focusing on a mechanism which allows adding high-level support for batch job processing middleware, e.g. EGEE LCG/gLite.

The OptIPuter project is pioneering a radical new type of distributed application paradigm that exploits dedicated optical circuits to tightly couple geographically dispersed resources. These private optical paths are set up on demand and combined with end resources to form a distributed virtual computer (DVC). The DVC provides high-quality dedicated network service to applications. In this article we compare the OptIPuter's approach (DVC), which exploits network resources to deliver higher-quality network services, to several alternative service models (intelligent network and asynchronous file transfer). Our simulations show that there are significant differences among the models in their utilization of resources and delivered application services. Key takeaways include that the OptIPuter approach provides applications with superior network service (as needed by emerging e-science applications and performance-critical distributed applications), at an expense in network resource consumption. The other approaches use fewer network resources, but provide lowerquality application service. © 2006 IEEE.",,"Distributed virtual computer (DVC); E-science applications; Network resources; Network service; Bandwidth; Computer simulation; Distributed computer systems; Medical computing; Optical data processing; Quality of service; Telecommunication networks","Taesombut, N.; University of California, San Diego, CA, United States; email: nut@cs.ucsd.edu",,,01636804,,ICOMD,,"English","IEEE Commun Mag",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745143212

His concept of the face of the Other redefines education as learning from the other, rather than about the other. Extrapolating the face of the Other to the non‐human world suggests an ethics for science education where the goal of pedagogy is peace with each other and the world through the rupture, eros and justice that arises from openness to the demands of the world. Understanding the infinite responsibility of the invocation presented by the face of the Other radically reconceptualizes science education from STS(E) towards an E‐STS curriculum of responsiveness that critically employs the said of modern science and opportunities of experience to enable the next generation of citizens to act in peace to what the world is saying. © 2006, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Curriculum theory; Ethics; Levinas; Philosophy; STS(E) science education",,"Blades, D.W.; University of VictoriaCanada",,,00131857,,,,"English","Educ.Philos.

Grids encourage and promote the publication, sharing and integration of scientifica data (distributed across several Virtual Organizations) in a more open manner than is currently the case, and many e-Science pojects have an urgent need to interconnect legacy and independently operated databases through a set os data access and integration services. The complexity of data management within a Computational Grid comes from the distribution, scale and heterogeneity of data sources. A set of dynamic and adaptive services could address specific issues related to automatic data management providing high performance and transparency as well as fully exploiting a grid infrastructure. These services should involved data migration and integration, discovery of data sources and so on, providing a transparent and dynamic layer of data virtualization.

For this reason well-informed disaster risk reduction (DRR) actions, where science and technology play a key role, are required. However insufficient communication between scientific and policy-making communities (known as the science-policy gap) hampers the use of science in DRR. Hence there is a strong need to interpret existing scientific knowledge into actionable knowledge, i.e. science that is useful, usable and used. This article presents a series of services and tools that build-upon existing scientific knowledge and aim to provide actionable knowledge to authorities and citizens for reducing the risks of elevated urban temperatures. The above were implemented in the context of the European Commission's Thermal Risk rEduction Actions and tools for secURE cities (TREASURE) project, and address many of the goals and priorities for action set in the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction (SFDRR) of the United Nations.

For optimized execution of workflows in the Grid, the high level middleware services (like task scheduler, resource broker, performance steering service etc.) need in-advance estimates of workflow execution times. However, modeling and predicting workflow execution time in the Grid is complex due to several tasks in a workflow, their distributed execution on multiple heterogeneous Grid-sites, and dynamic behaviour of the shared Grid resources. In this paper, we describe a novel method based on radial basis function neural network to model and predict workflow execution time in the Grid. We model workflows execution time in terms of attributes describing workflow structure and execution runtime information. To further refine our models, we employ principle component analysis to eliminate attributes of lesser importance. We recommend a set of only 14 attributes (as compared with total 21) to effectively model workflow execution time. Our reduced set of attributes improves the prediction accuracy by 16 %. Results of our prediction experiments for three real-world scientific workflows are presented to show that our predictions are more accurate than the two best methods from related work so far. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Distributed execution of scientific workflows; Scientific workflow applications; Workflow execution time prediction in the Grid","Complex networks; Functions; Middleware; Principal component analysis; Radial basis function networks; Middleware services; Principle component analysis; Radial basis function neural networks; Run-time information; Scientific applications; Scientific workflows; Workflow execution; Workflow structures; Forecasting","Nadeem, F.; Department of Information Systems, Saudi Arabia; email: fabdullatif@kau.edu.sa",,"Springer New York LLC",13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023202166

The findings identify several notable phenomena including motivating factors, the timing of collaboration formation, partner selection, communication methods, information-sharing practices, and barriers at each phase of the life cycle. We find that specific motivations were related to specific phases. The formation of collaboration was observed throughout the entire process, not only in the beginning phase of the cycle. For communication and information-sharing practices, scientists continue to favor traditional means of communication for security reasons.

In this paper, we examine the methodological challenges to data integration, with the hope that mitigating the technical obstacles will further promote data sharing. At a minimum, data integration efforts must document what data exist and how the data were collected (discovery), after which we can begin standardizing data collection practices with the aim of achieving combined analyses (synthesis).

We review the relevant data management principles for a general audience and supplement this with technical details drawn from over 15 years of paleontological and archeological field experience in Africa and Europe.

This has the potential to revolutionize data collection for population health, aspects of epidemiology, and health-related e-Science applications and as we will describe, provide new public health intervention capabilities, with the classifications and capabilities of such participatory sensing platforms only just beginning to be explored. Such a development will have important benefits for access to near real-time, large-scale, up to population-scale data collection. However, there are also numerous issues to be addressed first: provision of stringent anonymity and privacy within these methodologies, user interface issues, and the related issue of how to incentivize participants and address barriers/concerns over participation. To provide a step towards describing these aspects, in this paper we present a first classification of health participatory sensing models, a novel contribution to the literature, and provide a conceptual reference architecture for health participatory sensing networks (HPSNs) and user interaction example case study. © 2014-IOS Press and the authors.

This model opens an opportunity window to allow the integration of the enhanced science (eScience) with the Cloud paradigm. The eScience is computationally intensive science that is carried out in highly distributed computing infrastructures. Nowadays, the eScience big issue on Cloud Computing is how to leverage on-demand computing in scientific research. This requires innovation at multiple levels, from architectural design to software platforms. This paper characterizes the requirements of a federated hybrid cloud model of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to provide eScience. Additionally, an architecture is defined for constructing Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) in a resilient manner over federated resources. This architecture is named Rafhyc (for Resilient Architecture of Federated HYbrid Clouds). This paper also describes a prototype implementation of the Rafhyc architecture, which integrates an interoperable community middleware, named DIRAC, with federated hybrid clouds. In this way DIRAC is providing SaaS for scientific computing purposes, demonstrating that Rafhyc architecture can bring together eScience and federated hybrid clouds. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cloud computing; eScience; Federated cloud; Resilient architecture","Computing infrastructures; e-Science; Federated clouds; Hybrid cloud modeling; On-demand computing; Opportunity windows; Prototype implementations; Scientific researches; Cloud computing; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS); Middleware; Software as a service (SaaS); Platform as a Service (PaaS)","Méndez Muñoz, V.; Port d'Informació Científica (PIC), , Bellaterra, Spain; email: vmendez@pic.es",,,15707873,,,,"English","J.

The VPH Network of Excellence (VPH-NoE) project is tasked with facilitating interaction between the various VPH projects and addressing issues of common concern. A key deliverable is the 'VPH TOOLKIT'-a collection of tools, methodologies and services to support and enable VPH research, integrating and extending existing work across Europe towards greater interoperability and sustainability. Owing to the diverse nature of the field, a single monolithic 'toolkit' is incapable of addressing the needs of the VPH. Rather, the VPH TOOLKIT should be considered more as a 'toolbox' of relevant technologies, interacting around a common set of standards. The latter apply to the information used by tools, including any data and the VPH models themselves, and also to the naming and categorizing of entities and concepts involved. Furthermore, the technologies and methodologies available need to be widely disseminated, and relevant tools and services easily found by researchers. The VPH-NoE has thus created an online resource for the VPH community to meet this need. It consists of a database of tools, methods and services for VPH research, with a Web front-end. This has facilities for searching the database, for adding or updating entries, and for providing user feedback on entries. Anyone is welcome to contribute.

Early diagnosis of COVID patients is a critical challenge for medical practitioners, governments, organizations, and countries to overcome the rapid spread of the deadly virus in any geographical area. In this situation, the previous epidemic evidence on Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques encouraged the researchers to play a significant role in detecting COVID-19. Similarly, the rising scope of ML/DL methodologies in the medical domain also advocates its significant role in COVID-19 detection. This systematic review presents ML and DL techniques practiced in this era to predict, diagnose, classify, and detect the coronavirus. In this study, the data was retrieved from three prevalent full-text archives, i.e., Science Direct, Web of Science, and PubMed, using the search code strategy on 16 March 2021. Using professional assessment, among 961 articles retrieved by an initial query, only 40 articles focusing on ML/DL-based COVID-19 detection schemes were selected. Findings have been presented as a country-wise distribution of publications, article frequency, various data collection, analyzed datasets, sample sizes, and applied ML/DL techniques. Precisely, this study reveals that ML/DL technique accuracy lay between 80% to 100% when detecting COVID-19. The RT-PCR-based model with Support Vector Machine (SVM) exhibited the lowest accuracy (80%), whereas the X-ray-based model achieved the highest accuracy (99.7%) using a deep convolutional neural network. However, current studies have shown that an anal swab test is super accurate to detect the virus. Moreover, this review addresses the limitations of COVID-19 detection along with the detailed discussion of the prevailing challenges and future research directions, which eventually highlight outstanding issues. © 2021 by the authors.

They help scientists to design and execute complex in silico experiments. However, with rising complexity it becomes increasingly impractical to optimize scientific workflows by trial and error. To address this issue, we propose to insert a new optimization phase into the common scientific workflow life cycle. This paper describes the design and implementation of an automated optimization framework for scientific workflows to implement this phase. Our framework was integrated into Taverna, a life-science oriented workflow management system and offers a versatile programming interface (API), which enables easy integration of arbitrary optimization methods. We have used this API to develop an example plugin for parameter optimization that is based on a Genetic Algorithm. Two use cases taken from the areas of structural bioinformatics and proteomics demonstrate how our framework facilitates setup, execution, and monitoring of workflow parameter optimization in high performance computing e-science environments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It is of growing importance in the design of new drugs. The quantity of data now available for building models is increasing rapidly, which has the advantage that more accurate models can be created, for a wider range of properties. However the disadvantage is that the amount of computation required for model building has also dramatically increased. Therefore, it became vital to find a way to accelerate this process. We have achieved this by exploiting parallelism in searching the QSAR model space for the best models. This paper shows how the cloud computing paradigm can be a good fit to this approach. It describes the design and implementation of a tool for exploring the model space that exploits our e-Science Central cloud platform. We report on the scalability achieved and the experiences gained when designing the solution. The acceleration and absolute performance achieved is much greater than for existing QSAR solutions, creating the potential for new, interesting research, and the exploitation of this approach to accelerate other types of applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

To address this, we have designed and implemented BXGrid, a data repository and workflow abstraction for biometrics research. The system is composed of a relational database, an active storage cluster, and a campus computing grid. End users interact with the system through a high level abstraction of four stages: Select, Transform, AllPairs, and Analyze. A high degree of availability and reliability is achieved through transparent fail over, three phase operations, and independent auditing.

Sweden has a unique position in relation to data-sharing: a world-unique set of social science and medical data collections, a well-established tradition of regulations concerning data protection, a widely used form of personal identification that allows integration of databases, and a population that generally trusts researchers and the Swedish state with personal data. The aim of this study was to find out how Swedish database owners/managers and database users - key actors in the Swedish e-Science enterprise - anticipate the way that databases will be built up, managed and used in the future, and how this will influence e-Science. For this purpose, these actors were interviewed and official documents on the topic were studied.

In support of such data-intensive applications, we develop and evaluate control plane algorithms for scheduling bulk file transfers, where each transfer has a start time and an end time. We formulate the scheduling problem as a special type of the multi-commodity flow problem. To cope with the start and end time constraints of the file-transfer jobs, we divide time into uniform time slices. Bandwidth is allocated to each job on every time slice and is allowed to vary from slice to slice. This enables periodical adjustment of the bandwidth assignment to the jobs so as to improve a chosen performance objective: throughput of the concurrent transfers. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of using multiple time slices, the performance criterion being the tradeoff between achievable throughput and the required computation time. Furthermore, we investigate using multiple paths for each file transfer to improve the throughput. We show that using a small number of paths per job is generally sufficient to achieve near optimal throughput with a practical execution time, and this is significantly higher than the throughput of a simple scheme that uses single shortest path for each job. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, the development of Grid-enabled applications requires knowledge about Grid infrastructure and low-level API to Grid services. In turn, workflow management systems provide a high-level environment for rapid prototyping of experimental computing systems. Coupling Grid and workflow paradigms is important for the scientific community: it makes the power of the Grid easily available to the end user. The paradigm of data driven workflow execution is one of the ways to enable distributed workflow on the Grid. The work presented in this paper is carried out in the context of the Virtual Laboratory for e-Science project. We present the VLAM-G workflow management system and its core component: the Run-Time System (RTS). The RTS is a dataflow driven workflow engine which utilizes Grid resources, hiding the complexity of the Grid from a scientist. Special attention is paid to the concept of dataflow and direct data streaming between distributed workflow components. We present the architecture and components of the RTS, describe the features of VLAM-G workflow execution, and evaluate the system by performance measurements and a real life use case. © 2007 - IOS Press and the authors.

Grid computing offers many scientific and commercial benefits, but also many technical and organisational challenges. Amongst the challenges for grid computing is the need to provide reliable quality of service to end users, while enabling increasingly dynamic and federated usage scenarios. Understanding and quantifying the performance capabilities of a grid system and its applications is a crucial issue, without which performance improvements will be at best ad hoc. Nevertheless, this is particularly difficult for complex and dynamic systems like the grid, where both the computing environment (in terms of the contributing platforms and networks) and the application base are in continual change.

This new field requires a wide range of knowledge and skills from different disciplines including mathematics and statistics, computer science and information science. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of the study that explored the field of data science from the library and information science (LIS) perspective. Design/methodology/approach: Analysis of research publications on data science was made on the basis of papers published in the Web of Science database. The following research questions were proposed: What are the main tendencies in publication years, document types, countries of origin, source titles, authors of publications, affiliations of the article authors and the most cited articles related to data science in the field of LIS? What are the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective? Findings: The highest contribution to data science comes from the computer science research community. The contribution of information science and library science community is quite small. However, there has been continuous increase in articles from the year 2015. The main document types are journal articles, followed by conference proceedings and editorial material. The top three journals that publish data science papers from the LIS perspective are the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, the International Journal of Information Management and the Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology. The top five countries publishing are USA, China, England, Australia and India. The most cited article has got 112 citations. The analysis revealed that the data science field is quite interdisciplinary by nature. In addition to the field of LIS the papers belonged to several other research areas. The reviewed articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this research are that this study only analyzed research papers in the Web of Science database and therefore only covers a certain amount of scientific papers published in the field of LIS. In addition, only publications with the term “data science” in the topic area of the Web of Science database were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that are not reflected in the Web of Science database or were related to other keywords such as “e-science,” “e-research,” “data service,” “data curation” or “research data management.” Originality/value: The field of data science has not been explored using bibliographic analysis of publications from the perspective of the LIS. This paper helps to better understand the field of data science and the perspectives for information professionals. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliographic analysis; Business value; Data management; Data science; Data scientist; Information science; IoT; Library science; Literature review; Skills",,"Virkus, S.; School of Digital Technologies, Estonia; email: sirje.virkus@tlu.ee",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",25149288,,,,"English","Data Technol.

The present research tested this disidentification hypothesis among college women (N = 650) in academic majors that should be vulnerable (i.e., science and engineering) and immune (e.g., humanities and education) to these theorized effects. Results of structural equation modeling analyses were consistent with theoretical expectations, as stereotype threat was negatively and indirectly associated with the adoption of self- and task-approach achievement goals through its relationship with science identity for science and engineering majors but not women in nonstereotyped majors. For the latter group, stereotype threat bypassed science identity and was instead both directly and indirectly related to approach motivation.

These resources are increasingly delivered by multiple converged infrastructures, e.g. clouds that combine server, storage, and network resources from different providers. Such development requires careful re-thinking of the trust framework used between providers. As the scale and complexity of virtualization grows, so does the complexity of authorizing resource chains that are arranged across multiple providers. This type of authorization requires pre-establishment of trust relationships between providers and arranging some level of power. This paper studies the roles of trust and power when considering the requirements of authorization protocol exchanges between providers. Establishing power in the form of impersonal rules is a key element to conduce the necessary trust between providers. The Service Provider Group (SPG) is a way to arrange such power. The SPG framework provides a way to organize thinking about multi-provider services and can be used to describe emerging collaborations such as those found within the realm of optical network service provisioning. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Historically, these skills have been provided by different groups, and range from traditional 'wet' laboratory science to advanced numerical simulation. Increasingly, progress is made by global collaborations, in which new theory may be developed in one part of the world and applied and tested in the laboratory elsewhere. e-Science, or cyber-infrastructure, underpins such collaborations by providing a unified platform for accessing scientific instruments, computers and data archives, and collaboration tools. In this paper we discuss the application of advanced e-Science software tools to electrochemistry research performed in three different laboratories - two at Monash University in Australia and one at the University of Oxford in the UK. We show that software tools that were originally developed for a range of application domains can be applied to electrochemical problems, in particular Fourier voltammetry. Moreover, we show that, by replacing ad-hoc manual processes with e-Science tools, we obtain more accurate solutions automatically. © 2011 The Royal Society.","Fourier voltammetry; Parameter sweeps electrochemistry; Scientific workflows","Computer software; Application domains; Australia; Collaboration Tool; Cyber infrastructures; Data archives; e-Science; Fourier; Fourier voltammetry; Global collaboration; Manual process; New theory; Parameter sweeps electrochemistry; Scientific discipline; Scientific instrument; Scientific workflows; University of Oxford; Voltammetry","Abramson, D.; Faculty of Information Technology, Clayton, VIC 3800, Australia; email: david.abramson@infotech.monash.edu.au",,"Royal Society",1364503X,,,,"English","Philos.

In 2000, the aquifer was exploited from more than 9000 wells. The problem is that no precise information was recorded concerning the current extraction rates, their spatial distribution, or their evolution in time. In this study, a geostatistical model of the exploitation rates was constructed based on a multi-linear regression model combining incomplete direct data and exhaustive secondary information. The impacts of the uncertainty on the spatial distribution of the pumping rates on seawater intrusion were evaluated using a 3-D density-dependent groundwater model. To circumvent the large amount of computing time required to run transient models, the simulations were run in a parallel fashion on the Grid infrastructure provided by the Enabling Grid for E-Science in Europe project. Monte Carlo simulations results showed that 8.3% of the aquifer area is affected by input uncertainty. © 2010 IAHS Press.","Geostatistics; Grid computing; Numerical modelling; Seawater intrusion; Uncertainty","Computing time; Current extraction; Density-dependent; Discharge rates; e-Science; Geo-statistics; Geostatistical models; Grid infrastructures; Groundwater models; Input uncertainty; MONTE CARLO; Monte carlo analysis; Monte Carlo Simulation; Multi-linear regression; Numerical modelling; Pumping rate; Seawater intrusion; Transient model; Tunisia; Uncertainty; Aquifers; Groundwater resources; Linear regression; Monte Carlo methods; Numerical methods; Salt water intrusion; Seawater; Spatial distribution; Three dimensional; Grid computing; aquifer; artesian well; discharge; geostatistics; hydrological modeling; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; pumping; regression analysis; saline intrusion; spatial distribution; uncertainty analysis; Korba; Nabeul; Tunisia","Kerrou, J.; Centre for Hydrogeology, Rue Emile Argand 11, CP158, CH-2009 Neuchâtel, Switzerland; email: jaouher.kerrou@unine.ch",,,02626667,,HSJOD,,"English; French","Hydrol.

The increasing demands for computation times as the complexity of the simulation increases (e.g., increased sectorization order, smart antennas, etc., or combining system with link-level simulations) soon become prohibitively high. A WCDMA simulation is essentially a Monte Carlo simulation consisting of a large number of identical and independent processes, which are viable for efficient and cost-effective distributed processing on a grid infrastructure. In the work presented herein, a problem-solving environment (PSE) has been implemented for grid-enabled execution of WCDMA simulations on the production grid infrastructure deployed by the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE (EGEE) project. The problem-solving environment provides a secure, Web-based portal for interacting with the grid middleware (e.g., job submission and monitoring, result retrieval, etc.).

Providing the reader with a Humpty-Dumpty broken into bits, they are not compositions.

Thinking through the teaming up of students who use to focus their attention on one or other aspect of a country, he also touches on the importance of comparative research.

The implementation of this novel approach is described and evaluated for large nanoLC-FTICR-MS datasets. The speed benefits are determined by the network speed and file transfer protocols only and allow almost real-time analysis of complex data (e.g., a 3-gigabyte raw dataset is fully processed within 5 min). Key advantages of this approach are not limited to the improved analysis speed, but also include the improved flexibility, reproducibility, and the possibility to share and reuse the pre- and postprocessing strategies. The storage of all raw data combined with the massively parallel processing approach described here allows the scientist to reprocess data with a different set of parameters (e.g., apodization, calibration, noise reduction), as is recommended by the proteomics community. This approach of parallel processing was developed in the Virtual Laboratory for e-Science (VL-e), a science portal that aims at allowing access to users outside the computer research community.

This paper addresses that question for the case of digital medical images, more precisely mammograms (X-ray images of the breasts). It is argued that the kind of reasoning which treats mobility as a fixed asset of such images is problematic, because it obscures the particular perceptions, circumstances and practices that play a part in the accomplishment of medical images as mobile. The argument is based on ethnographic involvement with an e-Science/telemedicine research project aimed at demonstrating the benefits of a digital mammography database for breast cancer screening services, epidemiological research and radiology teaching in the UK. By focusing on the ways in which mammograms are re-presented as 'mobile data, and on how their movement is practically organized in the context of this project, the paper indicates a new direction for the sociological study of data mobility: one that understands the relationship between 'data and 'mobility as accomplished and emerging rather than fixed and inherent.","e-Science; Immutable mobiles; Medical imaging; Mobility; Science and technology studies; Telemedicine",,"Coopmans, C.; Innovation Studies Centre, South Kensington Camp, London, SW7 2AZ, United Kingdom; email: c.coopmans@imperial.ac.uk",,,1369118X,,,,"English","Inf.

For a variety of reasons including changes in methods, in understanding of the resource, and in policy initiatives in the commissioning of the survey, this problem is widespread in the results of natural resources surveys. We present two generic methods: one method is grounded in a statistical approach using discriminant analysis, and the other exploits the knowledge of experts. We use the context of land cover mapping of Great Britain to explore these approaches for integrating discordant data. We demonstrate that the expert-based approach gives very good levels of identification of locations with incompatible classifications at different times, and gives a much better rate of recognition of change. Some conclusions are made about the need to expand current metadata and data quality reporting to include descriptions of: - data conceptualisations, semantics and ontologies; - who decided and defined what the features of interest in a dataset are, and why. If the benefits of spatial data initiatives such as GRID, E-science and INSPIRE are to be fully realised then some method needs to be found to communicate that information most effectively to the potential user of the data. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Such scientific work is typically represented as workflows — the most common model for characterizing e-Science experiments and data analysis. Hosting and managing scientific applications on the cloud poses new challenges in terms of workflow scheduling which is key in leveraging its inherent cost and performance benefits. Prior research has studied static scheduling when the number of workflows is known in advance and all are submitted at the same time. However, in practice, a scheduler may have to schedule an unpredictable stream of workflows, for example, recent workflow management systems — such as Parsl, do not construct complete workflows at any stage during their execution, rather they generate partial workflows dynamically during execution — somewhat akin to lazy evaluation. This change in the way in which scientific data and workflows are created and processed represents a disruptive change to the way in which scheduling needs to occur. This paper represents a first and necessary step towards addressing scheduling problems of this nature, in which we present a new algorithm, Dynamic Workload Scheduler (DWS) that handles the dynamics of multiple deadline constrained workflows arriving randomly and scheduling these workflows with reducing cost in mind. Our results show that the DWS algorithm achieves an average 10% higher success rate in terms of fulfilling deadlines for different workloads and reduces the overall cost by an average 23% when compared to the most recent comparable algorithm. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"Cost reduction; Work simplification; Performance benefits; Scheduling problem; Scientific analysis; Scientific applications; State of the art; Static scheduling; Workflow management systems; Workflow scheduling; Scheduling","Bubendorfer, K.; School of Engineering and Computer Science, New Zealand; email: kris@ecs.vuw.ac.nz",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065640401

Sub-tenancy architecture (STA), is an extension of MTA, allows tenants to offer services for subtenant developers to customize their applications in the SaaS infrastructure. In a STA system, tenants can create subtenants, and grant their resources (including private services and data) to their subtenants. The isolation and sharing relations between parent-child tenants, sibling tenants or two non-related tenants are more complicated than those between tenants in MTA. It is important to keep service components or data private, and at the same time, allow them to be shared, and support application customizations for tenants. To address this problem, this paper provides a formal definition of a new tenant-based access control model based on administrative role-based access control (ARBAC) for MTA and STA in service-oriented SaaS (called TMS-ARBAC). Autonomous areas (AA) and AA-tree are proposed to describe the autonomy of tenants, including their isolation and sharing relationships. Authorization operations on AA and different resource sharing strategies are defined to create and deploy the access control scheme in STA models.

Commonly, the skill of the experimentalist is heavily relied upon to decide when a good fit of simulated to experimental data has been achieved. As an alternative approach, it is now shown how data analysis can be based on implementation of e-science software tools. Previously, a standard heuristic data analysis approach applied to the oxidation of ferrocene in acetonitrile (0.1 M Bu4NPF6) at a glassy carbon electrode using higher order harmonics available in Fourier transformed ac voltammetry implied that the heterogeneous charge transfer rate constant k 0 is ≥0.25 cm s-1 with the charge transfer coefficient (α) lying in the range of 0.25-0.75. Application of e-science software tools to the same data set allows a more meaningful understanding of electrode kinetic data to be provided and also offers greater insights into the sensitivity of the IRu (Ohmic drop) on these parameters. For example, computation of contour maps based on a sweep of two sets of parameters such as k0 and Ru or α and k0 imply that α is 0.50 ± 0.05 and that k0 lays in the range 0.2-0.4 cm s -1 with Ru around 130 Ohm. Quantitative evaluation of k0, α and Ru for the quasi-reversible [Fe(CN) 6]3-+e[Fe(CN)6]4- process at a glassy carbon electrode in aqueous media is also facilitated by use of e-science software tools. In this case, when used in combination with large amplitude Fourier transformed ac voltammetry, it is found for each harmonic that k 0 for the electrode process lies close to 0.010 cm s-1, α is 0.50 ± 0.05 and Ru is ≤10 Ohm. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Libraries' roles in this increasingly complex area of Web librarianship are often unclearly defined. The authors conducted two focus groups with physicians and researchers at an academic medical center, the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine, to gain a better understanding of the current state of data use and data management practices among translational researchers. Data management practices varied widely among departments, disciplines, and research centers, but common areas of concern important to Web librarianship included privacy, data access, and data stewardship. The results provided qualitative information about creating, managing, maintaining, and validating data in clinical and research environments, and challenges working with clinical research data in universities. These results inform current practices around data access, data sharing, and privacy of research participant data. Libraries can build on existing Web skills by instructing users how to find open source and commercial data sets, partnering to establish and implement improved data collection and archiving practices, and teaching principles of ethical data use. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","biomedical research data; data curation; digital data management; e-science; library roles; library services; medical libraries; translational research",,"Bardyn, T.

By using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model, we investigated the relationship between the proportion of alien occurrence across sites and habitat types (EUNIS) at family level with PAB putative drivers derived from LifeWatch and other open access geographic databases. Our results support the full model as the best-fitting option, highlighting that plant invasion in the Italian terrestrial ecosystems is a function of the combination of PAB conditions. In the first step of the invasion process, the accessibility time from towns plays a major role. By contrast, the abiotic filter imposed by environmental condition (high temperatures and low precipitations) as well the competition with the native community (high species richness) may pose a limit to the settlement and spread of alien species. Because of the high availability of similar data on PAB conditions worldwide, this study represents an effective and easy tool to design appropriate biodiversity conservation policies focused on the prevention of alien spread. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Abiotic factors; Biotic factors; Climate; LifeWatch; LTER-Italy network; Propagule pressure","Biodiversity; Conservation; Ecosystems; Risk assessment; Abiotic factors; Biotic factors; Climate; LifeWatch; Propagule pressures; Database systems; abiotic factor; assessment method; biodiversity; biological invasion; biotic factor; climate conditions; conservation planning; database; European Union; habitat type; infrastructure; integrated approach; introduced species; macroecology; native species; propagule; species richness; terrestrial ecosystem; Italy","Malavasi, M.; Department of Applied Geoinformatics and Spatial Planning, Kamycka 129, Czech Republic; email: malavasi@fzp.czu.cz",,"Elsevier B.V.",1470160X,,,,"English","Ecol.

The result is a set of temporally separated clusters interleaved by sub-sequences of unclustered points. A major novelty is the proposal of an outlier or noise model based on the distinction between intra-cluster (local noise) and inter-cluster noise (transition): the local noise models the temporary absence from a residence while the transition the definitive departure towards a next residence. We analyze in detail the properties of the model and present a comprehensive solution for the extraction of temporally ordered clusters. The effectiveness of the solution is evaluated first qualitatively and next quantitatively by contrasting the segmentation with ground truth. The ground truth consists of a set of trajectories of labeled points simulating animal movement. Moreover, we show that the approach can streamline the discovery of additional derived patterns, by presenting a novel technique for the analysis of periodic movement. From a methodological perspective, a valuable aspect of this research is that it combines the theoretical investigation with the application and external validation of the segmentation framework. This paves the way to an effective deployment of the solution in broad and challenging fields such as e-science. © 2018, The Author(s).","Clustering; Segmentation; Trajectories","Computer applications; Data mining; Image segmentation; Animal movement; Clustering; Inter clusters; Novel techniques; Spatial densities; Spatial trajectory; Theoretical investigations; Trajectory segmentation; Trajectories","Damiani, M.L.; Department of Computer Science, Italy; email: maria.damiani@unimi.it",,"Springer New York LLC",13845810,,,,"English","Data Min.

The current special issue on Theory and Theorizing in Nursing Science celebrates the 50th anniversary of publication of these seminal works in nursing theory. Objective The purpose of this commentary is to consider the future of nursing theory development in light of articles published in the anniversary issue. Approach The Editorial Team for the special issue identified core questions about continued nursing theory development, as related to the nursing metaparadigm, practice theory, big data, and doctoral education. Using a dialogue format, the editors discussed these core questions. Discussion The classic nursing metaparadigm (health, person, environment, nursing) was viewed as a continuing unifying element for the discipline but is in need of revision in today's scientific and practice climates. Practice theory and precision healthcare jointly arise from an emphasis on individualization. Big data and the methods of e-science are challenging the assumptions on which nursing theory development was originally based. Doctoral education for nursing scholarship requires changes to ensure that tomorrow's scholars are prepared to steward the discipline by advancing (not reifying) past approaches to nursing theory. Conclusion Ongoing reexamination of theory is needed to clarify the domain of nursing, guide nursing science and practice, and direct and communicate the unique and essential contributions of nursing science to the broader health research effort and of nursing to healthcare. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Herein, we discuss the stability of the folded and unfolded structures of proteins obtained from Anton's long simulations (Lindorff-Larsen, K.; Piana, S.; Dror, R. O.; Shaw, D.E. Science, 2011, 334, 517-520). Specifically, the stabilities of CLN025, the WW domain variant GTT, the triple mutant of the redesigned protein G variant NuG2, and the de novo-designed three-helix bundle protein are investigated. The solvation free energy of the structures is calculated using the three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the reference-modified density functional theory. The total energy is given by the sum of the conformational energy and the solvation free energy, and their balance results in the stabilization of protein structure, as demonstrated by the correspondence between structures with the lowest total energy of all proteins to their native structures. Overall, these findings indicate that the total energy function is appropriate for evaluating the stability of protein folding systems. Moreover, decomposing the energy terms reveals that proteins achieve their stabilities from the balance between the conformational energy and the solvation free energy. In particular, the solvation entropy is the main contributor to the process of folding from more extended structures to compact structures. The native structure is more stable than the compact structure owing to competition between intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. © 2017 American Chemical Society.",,"Density functional theory; Free energy; Solvation; Stability; Compact structures; Conformational energies; Dimensional reference; Extended structures; Intramolecular and intermolecular interactions; Native structures; Protein structures; Solvation free energies; Proteins; alpha3D protein, synthetic; nerve protein; oligopeptide; protein; YYDPETGTWY; chemistry; molecular dynamics; protein folding; protein stability; solubility; thermodynamics; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Oligopeptides; Protein Folding; Protein Stability; Proteins; Solubility; Thermodynamics","Mitsutake, A.; Department of Physics, Japan; email: ayori@mail.rk.phys.keio.ac.jp",,"American Chemical Society",15206106,,JPCBF,"28969418","English","J Phys Chem B",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032638603

Mapping such workflows in heterogeneous network environments and optimizing their end-to-end performance are crucial to the success of scientific collaborations that require fast system response and smooth data flow. We construct analytical cost models and formulate workflow mapping as optimization problems for minimum end-to-end delay and maximum frame rate. The difficulty of these problems essentially arises from the topological matching nature in the spatial domain, which is further compounded by the resource sharing complicacy in the temporal dimension. For unitary processing applications, we develop a workflow mapping algorithm based on a recursive critical path optimization procedure to minimize the latency; while for streaming applications, we conduct a rigorous workflow stability analysis and develop a layer-oriented dynamic programming solution based on topological sorting to identify and minimize the global bottleneck time. The accuracy of the proposed exact delay calculation algorithm is verified in comparison with an approximate solution, a dynamic distributed system simulation program, and a real network deployment, and the performance superiority of the proposed mapping approaches are illustrated by extensive simulation-based comparisons with existing algorithms and verified by large-scale experiments on real-life scientific workflows through effective system implementation and deployment in real networks. © 2015 IEEE.","distributed computing; end-to-end delay; frame rate; stability; Workflow optimization","Complex networks; Conformal mapping; Convergence of numerical methods; Data flow analysis; Dynamic programming; Heterogeneous networks; Mapping; Mobile telecommunication systems; Optimization; Topology; Distributed system simulations; End to end delay; Frame rate; Heterogeneous network environments; Performance analysis and optimizations; Processing applications; Scientific collaboration; Workflow optimization; Distributed computer systems",,,"IEEE Computer Society",00189340,,ITCOB,,"English","IEEE Trans Comput",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84963726025

Along with this trend comes the need to make at least the most important of these processes available for the long term, to allow later analysis of their execution, or even a re-execution. As such, the preservation of scientific experiments and their results enables others to reproduce and verify the results as well as build on the result of earlier work. All but the simplest processes require to be described by a multitude of information objects, as well as their interconnections and relations, to be successfully preserved. To enable a semantic description of these objects in a structured manner, we developed a formal meta-model that can be utilised in the digital preservation of a process. The meta-model describes classes of elements and their relations, in the form of ontologies, with a core ontology describing the generic concepts, and extension mechanisms to map supplementary ontologies describing more specific aspects. In this paper, we present the overall architecture and individual ontologies, and motivate their usefulness via the application to use cases from different domains. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Context; Digital preservation; Preservation metadata; Process preservation",,"Mayer, R.; Secure Business Austria, Favoritenstrasse 16, Austria",,"Springer Verlag",14325012,,,,"English","Int.

This requires the knowledge of numerous collisional line profiles. Nowadays, the access to such data via an online database becomes essential. STARK-B is a collaborative project between the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade and the Laboratoire d'Étude du Rayonnement et de la matière en Astrophysique (LERMA). It is a database of calculated widths and shifts of isolated lines of atoms and ions due to electron and ion collisions (impacts). It is devoted to modeling and spectroscopic diagnostics of stellar atmospheres and envelopes, laboratory plasmas, laser equipments and technological plasmas. Hence, the domain of temperatures and densities covered by the tables is wide and depends on the ionization degree of the considered ion. STARK-B has been fully opened since September 2008 and is in free access. The first stage of development was ended in autumn 2012, since all the existing data calculated with the impact semiclassical-perturbation method and code by Sahal-Bréchot, Dimitrijević and coworkers have now been implemented. We are now beginning the second stage of the development of STARK-B. The state of advancement of the database and our program of development are presented here, together with its context within VAMDC.

In many e-Science domains different specialists are working together and need to share data or even execute calculations using programs created by other persons. Each specialist may use a different problem solving environment and therefore the collaboration can become quite difficult. Our framework supports different cloud platforms, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Eucalyptus. Therefore it is possible to use hybrid cloud infrastructures, e.g. a private cloud based on Eucalyptus for general base-level computations using the available local resources and additionally a public Amazon EC2 for peaks and time-dependent calculations. Our approach is to provide a secure platform that supports multiple problem solving environments, execute code in parallel with different parameter sets using multiple cores or machines in a cloud environment, and support researchers in executing code, even if the required problem solving environment is not installed locally. Additionally, existing parallel resources can easily be utilized for ongoing scientific calculations. The framework has been validated by and used in our real project addressing large-scale breath analysis research. Its research-prototype version is available as a PaaS cloud service model.

These reports are primarily meant for human use. A recent movement is the addition of RDF metadata to make automatic processing by computers easier. A fine example of this movement is the open government data initiative which, by representing data from spreadsheets and textual reports in RDF, strives to speed up the creation of geographical mashups and visual analytic applications. In this paper, we present a newly linked dataset and the method we used to automatically translate semi-structured reports on the Web to an RDF event model. We demonstrate how the semantic representation layer makes it possible to easily analyze and visualize the aggregated reports to answer domain questions through a SPARQL client for the R statistical programming language. We showcase our method on piracy attack reports issued by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC-CCS). Our pipeline includes conversion of the reports to RDF, linking their parts to external resources from the linked open data cloud and exposing them to the Web. © 2012, The Author(s).","Information extraction; Linked data; Metadata enrichment",,"van Erp, M.; Department of Computer Science, De Boelelaan 1081a, Netherlands; email: marieke@cs.vu.nl",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",18612032,,,,"English","J.

Since in the grid and cloud environments, where we can execute the e-Science applications, heterogeneity of storage systems is higher than that of computational power resources, optimization of data access defines one of challenging tasks nowadays. In this paper we present our approach to management of data access in the grid environment. The main issue is to organize data in such a way that users requirements in the form of QoS/SLA are met. For this purpose we make use of a storage monitoring system and a mass storage system model - CMSSM.

The PSE-relating studies were started in 1970s to provide a higher-level programming language than Fortran, etc. in scientific computations. The trend of the time was natural to deliver more human-friendly programming environment, and was resulting in PSE, CAE (Computer Assisted Engineering), library, etc. At present PSE covers a rather wide area, for example, program generation support PSE, education support PSE, CAE software learning support PSE, GRID/CLOUD computing support PSE, job execution support PSE, e-Learning support PSE, PSE for PSE, etc. The review paper includes the PSE definition, a brief history of PSE, example PSE study activities, challenges of PSE study and a future of PSE studies.","Computer assisted problem solving; E-science; PSE; Scientific simulation","CAE software; Computer assisted; Computer assisted problem solving; E-Commerce; E-engineering; e-Science; Fortran; Higher-level programming languages; Human-friendly; Job execution; Learning support; Novel solutions; Problem solving environments; Problem-solving environment; Program generation; Programming environment; Scientific computation; Scientific simulations; State of the art; Target class; Wide area; Computer programming; Computer simulation; Computer software; FORTRAN (programming language); Innovation; Problem oriented languages; Problem solving","Kawata, S.; Department of Advanced Interdisciplinary Sciences, Yohtoh 7-1-2, Utsunomiya, 321-8585, Japan; email: kwt@cc.utsunomiya-u.ac.jp",,,19759320,,,,"English","J.

""Innovation community"" is a mode especially suitable for academic libraries, aimed at supporting the cultivation of innovation ability, encouraging user participation, joint construction, interaction and communication, designing different theme communities and organizing supporting services and activities so that both libraries and users can become entities of independent innovation. At the same time, this paper seeks to elaborate on the development of ideas on constructing this new mode of ""Innovation community"" by taking the IC2 mode and its auxiliary innovation support plan put forward by Shanghai Jiaotong University Library as a practice case. Design/methodology/approach - The paper adopts the research methodology that combines situation analysis and theoretical explanation, model exhibition and case study. Findings - It is found that ""Innovation community"" is a kind of library service mode especially suitable for learning and research groups with a demand for innovation. Under an e-science and e-education environment, libraries construct an environment and platform for promoting communication and cooperation and supporting interdisciplinary study and research innovation, and more effectively promoting knowledge discovery, research innovation and exploitation of tacit knowledge through individualized design and service of theme communities. Research limitations/implications - IC2ΣJTUL, the practice case of ""Innovation community"", has only constructed an environment at present, and the first term of this plan has not been completed. Therefore, evaluation of the actual operation effect cannot be made until later, and its actual effect has to be tested after a period of operation.

Since scientific data are often highly skewed and exploration tasks exhibit a large degree of spatial locality, we propose the locality-aware allocation of data objects onto a distributed network of interoperating databases. HiSbase is an approach to data management in scientific federated Data Grids that addresses the scalability issue by combining established techniques of database research in the field of spatial data structures (quadtrees), histograms, and parallel databases with the scalable resource sharing and load balancing capabilities of decentralized Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks.

With poverty deepening and environmental degradation worsening, what was necessary, the General Assembly said, was not a new philosophical or political debate, but rather a summit of actions and results (United Nations, 2002). We can question the WSSD accomplishments and whether the subsequent actions and results will contribute in meaningful ways to sustainable development. However, I think it is more important for science educators to ask: What are the implications of WSSD for science education? Why is science education not more intrinsically linked to the goals of human rights, democracy, and social justice? What are the ways in which science education ought to be connected to issues of sustainable development? In essence, where are the footpaths to/from science education? I investigate such questions in this position paper, while arguing that an education in science ought to enable learners to: (a) understand how the natural world works, (b) understand how human systems are interacting with natural systems, (c) assess the status and trends of crucial natural systems, and (d) promote and follow a long-term, sustainable relationship with the natural world. These are the very ways in which an education in science (i.e., science education) ought to be connected to issues of sustainable development. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2006.","Science education; Self- and social-empowerment; Social justice for all vision of education; Sustainable development",,"Kyle Jr., W.C.; Institute for Mathematics and Science Education and Learning Technologies, One University Boulevard, St. Louis, MO 63121-4499, United States; email: bill_kyle@umsl.edu",,,15710068,,,,"English","Int.

A significant effort in recent years has developed robust theories and standards for the representation of these traces across a variety of execution platforms. Whilst these are necessary to enable repeatability they do not exploit the captured information to its full potential. This data is increasingly being captured from applications hosted on Cloud Computing platforms, which offer large scale computing resources without significant up front costs. Medical applications, which generate large datasets are also suited to cloud computing as the practicalities of storing and processing such data locally are becoming increasingly challenging. This paper shows how provenance can be captured from medical applications, stored using a graph database and then used to answer audit questions and enable repeatability. This static provenance will then be combined with performance data to predict future workloads, inform decision makers and reduce latency. Finally, cost models which are based on real world cloud computing costs will be used to determine optimum strategies for data retention over potentially extended periods of time. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","E-science; Machine learning; Provenance; Workflow","Cloud computing; Computation theory; Costs; Data handling; Decision making; Learning systems; Medical applications; Cloud computing costs; Cloud computing platforms; E-sciences; Execution platforms; Large-scale computing; Performance prediction; Provenance; Workflow; Digital storage","Woodman, S.email: simon.woodman@ncl.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011256374

One prominent issue in such network environments with large footprints is that node and link failures are inevitable, hence potentially degrading the quality of data transfer. We consider two generic types of bandwidth reservation requests (BRRs) concerning data transfer reliability: (i) to achieve the highest data transfer reliability under a given data transfer deadline, and (ii) to achieve the earliest data transfer completion time while satisfying a given data transfer reliability requirement. We propose two periodic bandwidth reservation algorithms with rigorous optimality proofs to optimize the scheduling of individual BRRs within BRR batches.

Scientific workflows further integrate these services to answer complex research questions. However, our earlier study conducted on myExperiment has revealed that although the sharing of service-based capabilities opens a gateway to resource reuse, in practice, the degree of reuse is very low. This finding has motivated us to propose ServiceMap to provide navigation facility through the network of services to facilitate the design and development of scientific workflows. This paper proposes ReputationNet as an enhancement of ServiceMap, to incorporate the often-ignored reputation aspects of services/workflows and their publishers, in order to offer better service and workflow recommendations. We have developed a novel model to reflect the reputation of e-Science services/workflows, and developed heuristic algorithms to provide service recommendations based on reputations. Experiments on myExperiment have illustrated a strong positive correlation (with Pearson correlation coefficient 0.82) between the reputation scores computed and the actual performance (i.e. usage frequency) of the services/workflows, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach. © 2014 IEEE.","reputation; scientific workflow; service composition; Service oriented architecture","Complex networks; Correlation methods; Gateways (computer networks); Heuristic algorithms; Information services; Design and Development; Pearson correlation coefficients; reputation; Scientific computing applications; Scientific workflows; Service compositions; Service oriented science; Service recommendations; Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers",19391374,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

However, the current user-support process in cyber-infrastructure needs a feasible tool to support users. This tool must enable the users of a cyber-infrastructure to communicate efficiently with the staffs of a cyber-infrastructure in order to get technical and scientific assistance, whilst saving resources at the same time. This research paper narrates the real story of employing various forms of tools to support the user and staff communication. In addition this paper projects the lessons learned from an exploration of the help-desk tools in the current state of user support process in Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) from support staffs’ perspective. ESGF is a climate cyber-infrastructure that facilitates Earth System Modeling (ESM) and is taken as a case study in this paper. Finally, this study proposes a need for a tool, a framework or a platform that not only improves the user support process to address support servicing needs of end-users of e-Science infrastructures but also eases the life of staffs in providing assistance to the users. With the help of such a tool; the collaboration between users and the staffs of cyber-infrastructures is made easier.

Our framework captures data provenance unobtrusively in the background, allows for user annotations, provides undo/redo functionality at various levels of granularity, presents the captured provenance in an accessible format, and visualizes captured provenance to support analysis of the provenance log. We highlight several motivating use case scenarios which show how provenance queries can be answered by our approach.

It also seeks to focus on the potential challenges that the networked library faces in responding to massive needs of the researchers for digital content in different forms and formats. Design/methodology/approach - The author conducted a personal interview (face-to-face, and email communication) with 75 research faculties and postgraduate students in the colleges of business, engineering, IT, and sciences at the United Arab Emirates University (UAEU). The approach to design the conceptual model for the research-oriented library service was based on the feedback and observations of the interviewees on the pattern of query processing, research consultations (e.g. comprehensive, expert, topical search), e-resources coverage, and relevance of the returns to their queries and information needs. Findings - The proposed conceptual model demonstrates the virtual reference service, processing of research queries, online information search and retrieval, and data delivery to the researchers within a virtual research environment (VRE) in the UAEU. The study argues that the UAEU library should employ new strategies to meet the arising challenges of digital content and ongoing advances in information and communication technology (ICT), as well as considering how to embed itself within a research-intensive university. Research limitations/implications - The personal interview does not claim to be all-inclusive since the research faculties in the humanities and social studies were not reached. The inference of the study is encouraging the directors of the academic and research libraries to consider new models and strategies for providing reliable research-oriented information services for supporting the emerging paradigm of e-research activities. Practical implications - The study derived research-oriented service implications for the subject librarians to engage effectively with the research-devoted community either in the physical or in the virtual sphere, i.e. a two-faceted sphere. Originality/value - An extensive literature review revealed that there is a lack of scholarly works on research-oriented library services that are provided by the academic libraries at the UAE-based universities. The study is the first in the UAE to provide a broad understanding to an academic library in a research-intensive environment for adjusting its web-based information services. It presents also a suitable approach to embed librarians in the activities of the new paradigms of e-learning and e-science. © Copyright - 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

These spaces respectively produced clinical medicine, social medicine, and what were termed the sciences accessoires (i.e., sciences auxiliary to medicine). The medical field-the product of a set of closely interrelated scientific and social determinants, all concerning the functions assigned to hospitals of producing medical knowledge, training physicians and selecting an elite through a system of competitive examinations-was dominated by hospital physicians in the clinical space. That domination worked to preserve the field's autonomy, since the spaces of social medicine and auxiliary sciences overlapped those of other fields and developed through the construction of hybrid rather than specifically medical knowledge and practices; i.e., knowledge and practices in those two spaces could be mastered by other professional groups. However, it was through the development of those dominated spaces that medicine was able to extend the variety and types of its own practices and assume an active role in preventing disease, reducing mortality and pushing forward knowledge of life, thereby increasing its authority in French society.",,,"Pinell, P.; Centre de Sociologie Européenne (CSE) CNRS, 59-61, rue Pouchet, 75017 Paris, France; email: patrice.pinell@cse.cnrs.fr",,"Editions Ophrys",00352969,,,,"English","Rev.

Considering the huge and widely distributed amounts of data, e-science communities investigate different technologies to provide fast access to the growing data sets. Among these technologies, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Data Grid are two models that fit these requirements well, because of their potential to provide a high quality of service with low cost. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using the P2P paradigm for data-intensive e-science applications on the Grid. We argue that additional support is required to achieve fast access to the huge and widely distributed amounts of data and propose eSciGrid to overcome the scalability barriers in today's e-science communities. eSciGrid allows e-science communities to achieve a high query throughput through a decentralized protocol which integrates caching with query processing. The protocol takes into account the physical distance between peers and the amount of traffic carried by each node. The result of this integration is constant complexity for moderate queries and fast data transfers between Grid peers. Our results show that eSciGrid increases the performance of data access on e-science Grids. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Programmers have to face with both parallel and distributed programming paradigms when designing an application. This is especially true when dealing with e-Science applications. Moreover, as parallel processing is moving to the mainstream, it does not seem appropriate to rely on low-level solutions requiring expert knowledge. This paper studies how to combine modern programming practices such as those based on software components and one of the most important parallel programming paradigms which is the well-known master-worker paradigm. The goal is to provide a simple and resource transparent model while enabling an efficient utilization of resources. The paper proposes a generic approach to embed the master-worker paradigm into software component models and describes how this generic approach can be implemented within an existing software component model.

In particular, the upper-ocean heat content and circulation have a critical influence. Decadal prediction is still in its infancy and there is an urgent need to understand the important processes that determine predictability on these timescales. We have taken the first Hadley Centre Decadal Prediction System (DePreSys) and implemented it on several NERC institute compute clusters in order to study a wider range of initial condition impacts on decadal forecasting, eventually including the state of the land and cryosphere. The eScience methods are used to manage submission and output from the many ensemble model runs required to assess predictive skill. Early results suggest initial condition skill may extend for several years, even over land areas, but this depends sensitively on the definition used to measure skill, and alternatives are presented.

To achieve such resolution levels, sophisticated algorithms for tomographic reconstruction are needed. Iterative algebraic algorithms yield high quality reconstructions, but they are computationally expensive and high performance techniques are needed to exploit them in practice. We present here a grid computing approach for tomographic reconstruction of large biological specimens. The approach is based on the computational Single-Program-Multiple-Data model, which basically decomposes the global problem into a number of independent 3D reconstruction subproblems. New performance metrics and job submission policies are proposed here that could be of general interest in the field of Grid Computing. We have evaluated this approach on the grid hosted by the European EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE) project. The influence of the problem size and the parallelism grain has been thoroughly analyzed. Our results demonstrate that the grid is better suited for large reconstructions, as currently needed in electron tomography.

Consequently, a firm understanding of not only the technical structure but of the social and communicative structure of e-science will be necessary in order to adapt licensing solutions to the practice of e-science. © 2007 International Communication Association.",,"Intellectual property; Laws and legislation; Collaborative activities; Distributed collaboration; Intellectual property rights; Intellectual resources; Organizational structures; Physical locations; Scientific researches; Technical structures; Distributed computer systems","Burk, D.L.; Law School, United States",,"Wiley Blackwell",10836101,,,,"English","J.

An important disadvantage of those simulations is the fundamental burden of computation time. This manuscript describes three different techniques in order to improve the efficiency of those simulations. Firstly, the implementation of variance reduction techniques (VRTs), more specifically the incorporation of geometrical importance sampling, is discussed. After this, the newly designed cluster version of the GATE software is described. The experiments have shown that GATE simulations scale very well on a cluster of homogeneous computers. Finally, an elaboration on the deployment of GATE on the Enabling Grids for E-Science in Europe (EGEE) grid will conclude the description of efficiency enhancement efforts. The three aforementioned methods improve the efficiency of GATE to a large extent and make realistic patient-specific overnight Monte Carlo simulations achievable. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To ensure the correctness of grid workflow specification and execution, grid workflow verification and validation must be conducted so that we can identify any violations and consequently take proper action to remove them in time. However, current research on the grid workflow verification and validation is just at the early stage and very few projects focus on them. Therefore, a systematic identification of key research issues in the grid workflow verification and validation field is no doubt helpful and should be presented so that we can be on the right track and reduce unnecessary work as far as possible. Hence, in this paper, we systematically analyse the grid workflow verification and validation and investigate their key research issues. Especially, we identify some important open research points which are not discussed by the current research and hence need further investigation.

This paper investigates the relationship between components to identify these mappings by a set of semantic links and develops relevant rules to form a mechanism for semantically networking and using components. Flexible component reuse can be realized by semantic retrieval and rule reasoning. Extending the notion of component to a general service mechanism, this paper further investigates the organization, reuse and clustering of components in form of Web services and research spaces.

However, this description is unable to account for the presence of multiple time scale dynamics. In this work, we present an alternative model for the interpretation of the stochastic processes underlying these fluctuations of resonance frequencies. Time correlation functions of 15N amide chemical shifts computed from molecular dynamics simulations (MD) were analyzed in terms of a transiently fractional diffusion process. The analysis of MD trajectories spanning dramatically different time scales (∼200 ns and 1 ms [ Shaw, D. E.; Science 2010, 330, 341-346 ]) allowed us to show that our model could capture the multiple scale structure of chemical shift fluctuations.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper gives a glimpse of the new ICI initiative. It briefly describes its promises and coverage. This paper is based on data available in the ICI portal and its information brochure. Findings: The ICI has made an attempt to create a web-based citation database covering a whole range of disciplines, i.e. sciences, technologies, social sciences and humanities. This paper also identifies similar initiatives in the past, which failed due to the absence of web technologies and web-based business models. Research limitations/implications: This paper informs the availability of a web-based ICI to a worldwide audience. Many in-depth studies can now be undertaken to measure productivity of Indian research journals vis-à-vis Indian researchers using datasets of this citation database. Some studies can also be made to measure popularity of Indian journals amongst foreign researchers and foreign research collaborators. Social implications: If this initiative is successful, other countries will be inspired to have their own country-specific citation database to measure performance of home-grown research periodicals.

Many scientific problems are beyond the realm of individual discipline or scientist to solve and hence, require collaborative efforts. Meanwhile, today's science becomes increasingly more data intensive, resulting in a rapid transition from computational science to e-science (or digital science). Recently, scientific workflows have emerged for scientists to integrate distributed computations, datasets, and analysis tools to enable and accelerate scientific discovery. The convergence of the above two trends naturally leads to the concept of collaborative scientific workflows. This paper presents a disciplinary definition of this term, discusses the opportunities, requirements, and challenges of collaborative scientific workflows for the enablement of scientific collaboration, and concludes with our ongoing work in this direction.

For its future development, it would be useful to identify a distinctive lexicon and widely shared conception to help scholars understand its essence. In this study, exploratory work was conducted using a large-scale survey of e-Government articles from 1993 to 2008. A total of 752 abstracts from the world's leading databases (i.e. Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI) and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S)) were retrieved, and 528 were analyzed using Computer-Aided Text Analysis (CATA) software. Based on the content analysis, a widely shared conception of the field held by its members was determined and a methodology to obtain a consensual definition of an academic field was designed. Points for practitioners By determining and presenting a widely shared conception of e-Government, this study aims to provide scholars, particularly the young, with a deeper understanding of the scope and meaning of the field. This consensual conception may serve either as a screen or as a magnet for future practitioners and academics. The methodology may be applied to several academic fields, including administration science, library science, management science, computer science, and others. © The Author(s) 2010.","conceptual construction; consensual conception; e-Government; lexicographic analysis; public administration; semantic reasoning","computer aided design; conceptual framework; database; future prospect; government; public administration; software","Hu, G.; Nanjing University, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing, 210096, China; email: hugw@nju.edu.cn",,,00208523,,,,"English","Int.

In particular, the SCRamjet Engine which is the propulsion system for a hypersonic vehicle has been studied to see if it is able to run. However, most research related to the SCRamjet doesn't provide detailed results. Therefore, the result of SCRamjet research is done in an e-science AHM in order to share advanced resources and to allow collaborative research. Airflow into the combustor of a scramjet engine stays inside for a very short time i.e. on the order of milliseconds. Since the whole process of combustion has to be completed during this short duration, research on supersonic combustion technologies is of great significance. Of the many technologies, this study is concerned with methods that improve the air-fuel mixture efficiency. By selecting a method that uses a cavity and vertical jet injection, this study investigates the characteristics of the flow field by using both numerical analysis and experimental methods. The cavity size alone is varied while the length-height ratio (L/H) of the cavity is fixed at 1, and the sonic jet is injected vertically through a 1-mm-diameter nozzle downstream of the cavity. A numerical analysis reveals that larger cavities correspond to larger vortices, which is a measure of the air - fuel mixture. Specifically, near the bottom of the combustor (y/D = 5), where mixing is most active, large vorticities are seen. Furthermore, for a comparison and verification of the results of the numerical analysis, visualization using shadowgraphs and measurements of the pressure using pressure sensitive paint (PSP) are conducted in the supersonic wind tunnel at Konkuk University. Allowing for better understanding of the physics of the flow, the visualization results show good qualitative agreement with regards to the shape of the Shockwaves and changes in the shear-layer thickness while the results from the pressure measurements confirm that the analysis results are close to the experimental results.","Cavity; Mixing enhancement; Pressure sensitive paint; SCRamjet; Vertical jet injection",,"Seo, H.; Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd., Sacheon 664-710, South Korea",,,03744884,,,,"English","J.

The paper also describes a service SMD management system in the context of the UK e-Science project GEODISE. A suite of tools are developed, which forms the core of the SMD management infrastructure. We demonstrate the added value of the use of SMD through the integration of SMD management with GEODISE application systems.

A seamless distributed computing approach is used to provide remote secure visualization, monitoring and interaction with the laboratory and the diffraction experiment, supervision and input to the data workup and analysis processes, and to enable dissemination and further use of the resulting structural data. The architecture of the system is based on web and grid services (in particular the use of Globus, v1.1.4), which provide a secure environment for two-way information flow and communication between the service users and operators. This capability will enhance operations of instrument and software automation by providing more efficient use of the resources, increasing the throughput of samples and enabling interactions with distributed chemistry information databases, computational services and networks. The viability of these interactions is assessed and directions for future crystallography services suggested.

The number of geographic information systems software packages and algorithms has also grown quickly during this period, fueled by rapid advances in computing and the explosive growth in the availability of digital data describing specific phenomena. Geographic information scientists therefore increasingly find themselves choosing between multiple software suites and algorithms to execute specific analysis, modeling, and visualization tasks in environmental applications today. This is a major challenge because it is often difficult to assess the efficacy of the candidate software platforms and algorithms when used in specific applications and study areas, which often generate different results. The subtleties and issues that characterize the field of geomorphometry are used here to document the need for (1) theoretically based software and algorithms; (2) new methods for the collection of provenance information about the data and code along with application context knowledge; and (3) new protocols for distributing this information and knowledge along with the data and code.

In this paper, we present our ongoing efforts aimed at addressing these critical gaps through the customized design and build of suitable data infrastructure elements. Specifically, our solutions include: (1) ELA—an experimental and laboratory automation software platform that systematically tracks interrelationships between the heterogeneous experimental datasets (i.e., provenance) acquired from diverse sample preparation and materials characterization equipment in a single consistent metadata database, (2) PyMKS—the first Python-based open-source materials data analytics framework that can be used to create high-fidelity, reduced-order (i.e., low computational cost), process–structure–property linkages for a broad range of material systems with a rich hierarchy of internal structures spanning multiple length scales, and (3) MATIN—a HUBzero-based software platform aimed at nucleating an emergent e-science community at the intersection of materials science, manufacturing, and computer science, and facilitating highly productive digital collaborations among geographically and organizationally distributed materials innovation stakeholders.

A large quantity of heterogeneous and distributed data has been produced on phytoplankton traits and their use could be made more effective and efficient if data harmonization and interoperability would be improved. The use of controlled vocabularies and thesauri is an acknowledged good practice to establish the foundation for semantic interoperability, a critical requirement for reuse and sharing of data. In fact, thesauri, collectively constructed, bypass ambiguity issues in natural language, facilitating the identification and integration of the information available in multiple data sources and allowing both scientists and computer applications to interpret more effectively the meaning of data. Here we present a semantic resource on phytoplankton functional traits: the PhytoTraits thesaurus (http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/PhytoTraits/index.php). PhytoTraits is the result of the interdisciplinary collaboration of experts both from the phytoplankton functional domain and from information and communication technologies, working together within LifeWatch Italy, the Italian node of the e-science European infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research. PhytoTraits is the first initiative to deal with the semantics of phytoplankton functional traits, focusing on morpho-functional traits towards standardized bio-volume assessment. It reflects the agreement of a scientific expert community to fix semantic properties (e.g. label, definition) of approximately 120 traits. Following semantic web standard technologies, the thesaurus was implemented in Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), a common data model based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF). PhytoTraits is freely available online, it can be queried through a SPARQL endpoint (http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/PhytoTraits/sparql.php) and is also accessible via API (http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/PhytoTraits/services.php) for integration with other systems. If adopted as a standard and rigorously applied and enriched by the scientific community, PhytoTraits, providing harmonized concepts with associated unique and resolvable URIs, has the potential to significantly reduce the barriers to data discovery, integration, and exchange. © 2017","Functional diversity; Phytoplankton trait; Sematic interoperability; SKOS; Thesaurus","community structure; computer simulation; functional role; heterogeneity; interdisciplinary approach; Internet; niche; phytoplankton; range expansion; research work; species diversity; Italy","Rosati, I.; LifeWatch ItalyItaly; email: ilaria.rosati@cnr.it",,"Elsevier B.V.",15749541,,,,"English","Ecol.

Data information literacy-the skills needed to understand, use, manage, share, work with, and produce data-reflects the confluence of data skills with information literacy competencies. This research assessed perceptions of data information literacy and attitudes on its instruction for graduate students in meteorology. As academic librarians have traditionally provided information literacy instruction, the research determined if they were perceived as having a role in data information literacy instruction. The modified Delphi method was applied to obtain the perspectives of a panel of experts, representing students, librarians, professors, and researchers, for the purpose of forecasting and consensus-making. Through the consideration of the University of Oslo's Department of Geosciences' Meteorology Section, the research found that data information literacy skills were relevant to the work of meteorology students. Stakeholders perceived that academic librarians could play a future role in general instruction but that they would have to overcome obstacles to be involved in data information literacy instruction. For librarians to enter this domain, they would need to improve their technical skills, enhance their discipline-specific knowledge, or rely on collaborations. The significance of these findings was limited by the modest target population under examination; as a consequence, the results were strongly linked to the specific setting. Further studies would be necessary to determine their generalizability. 2016 Emily P. Frank and Nils Pharo.",,,,,"Association of College and Research Libraries",00100870,,,,"English","Coll. Res.

This process includes large computations that require advanced computing infrastructure; however, using rapidly evolving high-performance computing platforms can be difficult for biochemists. In this paper, we present a science gateway for virtual screening that has been tailored to the specific needs of our local users. The gateway provides user-friendly access to distributed computing infrastructures for high-throughput experiments with a few clicks. Its design is based on the generic layer developed for another gateway for neuroimaging data analysis, including data and computation management, as well as support for its operation. To facilitate scalability, the system architecture allows for adding new computing platforms to the back-end without affecting the front-end, from which the user can dynamically choose the preferred infrastructure. This paper describes the user-centered design process, the system architecture and a performance assessment using gLite grid, Hadoop, and a local cluster.

Informatics experts from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) have pioneered a principled informatics infrastructure to capture and disseminate data from biomarker validation studies, in effect, providing a national-scale, real-world successful example of how to address these challenges. EDRN is a distributed, collaborative network and it requires its infrastructure to support research across cancer research institutions and across their individual laboratories. The EDRN informatics infrastructure is also referred to as the EDRN Knowledge Environment, or EKE. EKE connects information about biomarkers, studies, specimens and resulting scientific data, allowing users to search, download and compare each of these disparate sources of cancer research information. EKE's data is enriched by providing annotations that describe the research results (biomarkers, protocols, studies) and that link the research results to the captured information within EDRN (raw instrument datasets, specimens, etc. ). In addition EKE provides external links to public resources related to the research results and captured data. EKE has leveraged and reused data management software technologies originally developed for planetary and earth science research results and has infused those capabilities into biomarker research. This paper will describe the EDRN Knowledge Environment, its deployment to the EDRN enterprise, and how a number of these challenges have been addressed through the capture and curation of biomarker data results. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

A large number of these datasets are surfacing online in public and private catalogs, often annotated with XML metadata, as part of community efforts to foster open research. With this rapid expansion comes the challenge of filtering and selecting datasets that best match the needs of scientists. We address a key aspect of the scientific data discovery process by ranking search results according to a personalized data quality score based on a declarative quality profile to help scientists select the most suitable data for their applications. Our quality model is resilient to missing metadata using a novel strategy that uses provenance in its absence. Intuitively, our premise is that the quality score for a dataset depends on its provenance - the scientific task and its inputs that created the dataset - and it is possible to define a quality function based on provenance metadata that predicts the same quality score as one evaluated using the user's quality profile over the complete metadata. Here we present a model and architecture for data quality scoring, apply machine learning techniques to construct a quality function that uses provenance as proxy for missing metadata, and empirically test the prediction power of our quality function. Our results show that for some scientific tasks, quality scores based on provenance closely track the quality scores based on complete metadata properties with error margins between 1-29 percent.","Accessibility; Data quality; E-Science; Information retrieval; Missing metadata; Provenance; Scientific data; Social perception",,"Simmhan, Y.; University of Southern California, Los Angeles CA 90089, United States; email: simmhan@usc.edu",,,10765204,,,,"English","Int.

The project has developed a grid-based solution that supports the electronics design process, incorporating usage of large-scale high-performance computing (HPC) resources, data and metadata management and support for fine-grained security to protect commercially sensitive datasets. In this paper, we illustrate how the nano-CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) grid has been applied to optimize transistor dimensions within a standard cell library. The goal is to extract high-speed and low-power circuits which are more tolerant of the random fluctuations that will be prevalent in future technology nodes. Using statistically enhanced circuit simulation models based on three-dimensional atomistic device simulations, a genetic algorithm is presented that optimizes the device widths within a circuit using a multi-objective fitness function exploiting the nano-CMOS grid. The results show that the impact of threshold voltage variation can be reduced by optimizing transistor widths, and indicate that a similar method could be extended to the optimization of larger circuits.

This paper proposes a conceptual reference model of collaborative network coordination that satisfies flexibility and agility requirements of virtual organisation by building on common software service abstractions and lifecycle methodology. In particular, the model focuses collaborative service networks and introduces the concept of virtual business service that represents business service processes as software service abstractions and supports flexible regulation and agile enforcement of their coordination by means of software service lifecycle methodology. For demonstration and evaluation purpose, we present a case study of service-oriented systems analysis for virtual organisation of a collaborative e-science network that adopts our conceptual reference model. © 2008 Springer-Verlag London Limited.","Conceptual modelling; Organisational virtualisation; Service-oriented ICT infrastructure; Service-oriented systems analysis; Virtual service enterprises","Abstracting; Communication; Computer networks; Computer software; Information technology; Metropolitan area networks; Modal analysis; Network protocols; Systems analysis; Systems science; Technology; Business processing; business services; case studies; Collaborative networks; Common software; E sciences; Information and communication technology (ITC); Life Cycle (LC); production networks; reference models; service networks; Service oriented software; Service-oriented; software services; Springer (CO); Virtual organisations; Virtual service; Distributed computer systems","Zirpins, C.; Computer Science Department, , London, United Kingdom; email: C.Zirpins@cs.ucl.ac.uk",,,18632386,,,,"English","Serv.

This infrastructure allows scientists to process complex and time consuming computations in parallel on demand. Phylogenetic inference for large data sets of DNA/protein sequences is known to be computationally intensive and could greatly benefit from this parallel supercomputing approach. Bayesian algorithms allows the estimation of important parameters on species divergence modus and time but at the price of running repetitive long series of MonteCarlo simulations. As part of the BioinfoGrid project, we ported parallel MrBayes to the EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE) grid infrastructure. As case study we investigate both a challenging dataset of arthropod phylogeny and the most appropriate model of amino acid replacement for that data set. Our aim is to resolve the position of basal hexapod lineages with respect to Insecta and Crustacea.

In particular, our motivation was to aid the development of cyberinfrastructure for Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEAs) for marine ecosystems. The IEA process involves analysis of natural and socio-economic information based on diverse and disparate sources of data, requiring collaboration among scientists of many disciplines and communication with other stakeholders. Here we describe our bottom-up approach to developing cyberinfrastructure through a collaborative process engaging a small group of domain and computer scientists and software engineers. We report on a use case evaluated for an Ecosystem Status Report, a multi-disciplinary report inclusive of Earth, life, and social sciences, for the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem. Ultimately, we focused on sharing workflows as a component of the cyberinfrastructure to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility. We developed and deployed a software environment to generate a portion of the Report, retaining traceability of derived datasets including indicators of climate forcing, physical pressures, and ecosystem states. Our solution for sharing workflows and delivering reproducible documents includes IPython (now Jupyter) Notebooks. We describe technical and social challenges that we encountered in the use case and the importance of training to aid the adoption of best practices and new technologies by domain scientists.

From the perspectives of architecture, comparison and reuse, the purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey on four mainstream units ontologies: quantity-unit-dimension-type, quantities, units, dimensions and values, ontology of units of measure and units ontology (UO) of the open biomedical ontologies, in order to address well the state of the art and the reuse strategies of the UO. Design/methodology/approach: An architecture of units ontologies is presented, in which the relations between key factors (i.e. units of measure, quantity and dimension) are discussed. The criteria for comparing units ontologies are developed from the perspectives of organizational structure, pattern design and application scenario. Then, the authors compare four typical units ontologies based on the proposed comparison criteria. Furthermore, how to reuse these units ontologies is discussed in materials science domain by utilizing two reuse strategies of partial reference and complete reference. Findings: Units ontologies have attracted high attention in the scientific domain. Based on the comparison of four popular units ontologies, this paper finds that different units ontologies have different design features from the perspectives of basis structure, units conversion and axioms design; a UO is better to be applied to the application areas that satisfy its design features; and many challenges remain to be done in the future research of the UO. Originality/value: This paper makes an extensive review on units ontologies, by defining the comparison criteria and discussing the reuse strategies in the materials domain. Based on this investigation, guidelines are summarized for the selection and reuse of units ontologies. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","E-science; Materials ontology; Materials science domain; Ontology reuse; Units of measure; Units ontology",,"Li, K.; School of Information Science and Engineering, China; email: mengyao_lk@163.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",00330337,,,,"English","Program",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020848050

ESPAS provides access to metadata and/or data from an extended network of data providers distributed globally. The interoperability of the heterogeneous data collections is achieved with the adoption and adaption of the ESPAS data model which is built entirely on ISO 19100 series geographic information standards. The ESPAS data portal manages a vocabulary of space physics keywords that can be used to narrow down data searches to observations of specific physical content. Such content-targeted search is an ESPAS innovation provided in addition to the commonly practiced data selection by time, location, and instrument.

Astrophysical evidence shows that dark matter exists in the universe, hinting at new physics beyond the Standard Model. Therefore, there are efforts to search for dark matter candidates using direct detection, indirect detection, and collider detection. There are also efforts to build theoretical models for dark matter. Current astroparticle physics involves big investments in theories and computing along with experiments. The complexity of such an area of research is explained within the framework of the e-Science paradigm. The idea of the e-Science paradigm is to unify experiment, theory, and computing.

It is created on the basis of Web Service - Parallel Grid Run-time and Application Development Environment (WS-PGRADE) and gUSE (grid and cloud User Support Environment) technologies, where WS-PGRADE is designed for science workflow operation and gUSE - for smooth integration of available resources for parallel and distributed computing in various heterogeneous DCIs. Some use cases (scientific workflows) are considered for molecular dynamics simulations of complex behavior of various nanostructures. The modular approach allows scientists to use SG portals as research hubs of various virtual experimental labs in the context of practical applications in material science, physics, and nanotechnologies. In addition, workflows and their components are proposed to be used as Lego-style construction units for learning modules of various scale by duration, complexity, targeted audience, and so on.

Together, these two aspects facilitate automation and empower users. Recent progress toward these goals, and the rich set of future possibilities in this regard, can be understood most clearly in the eScience context. Scientific research produces large amounts of complex, numeric content. A new class of DLs with supporting services for such content is vital to advancing scientific practice. Intelligent services also are needed to automate scientific workflows. Simulation environments are especially well suited for automation with digital libraries. The SimDL framework generates simulation-supporting DL instances. This framework includes a set of service implementations, a software toolkit, formal definitions of services and content, and processes for producing workflows of services and layers. Integrating such DL instances within a scientific research infrastructure leads to the automation of many routine tasks and to more intelligent services. This gives a glimpse of the future of more intelligent information systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Digital libraries; eScience; Infrastructure; Simulation","Automation; Computer aided software engineering; e-Science; Information systems; Information use; Infrastructure; Intelligent information systems; Intelligent Services; Intelligent technology; Scientific researches; Scientific workflows; Simulation; Simulation environment; Digital libraries","Leidig, J.P.; School of Computing and Information Systems, United States",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",09259902,,JIISE,,"English","J Intell Inform Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925514230

It is difficult to deploy and maintain a WSN system, especially in the study area of the Heihe River basin where harsh weather conditions and treacherous terrain can compromise the performance of such a system, while at the same time, high-energy efficiency, reliable delivery and high-quality measurements are required. To increase reliability under these conditions, protective and redundancy measures were utilised in the deployment. These nodes are now installed to collect data and transmit them through several repeaters to the base station in the experimental research establishment, where the data are automatically transmitted to the server in the establishment, and finally transferred to supercomputers in our institute through an optical fibre channel, thus achieving complete automated online data storage, analysis and real-time display.

This dimension of 'big data' research calls for the development of computational tools to manage such a vast amount of data, as well as tools that can improve communication and access to information from collaborating researchers and from the wider community. Whenever research projects have a defined temporal scope, an additional issue of data management arises, namely how the knowledge generated within the project can be made available beyond its boundaries and life-time. DC-THERA is a European 'Network of Excellence' (NoE) that spawned a very large collaborative and interdisciplinary research community, focusing on the development of novel immunotherapies derived from fundamental research in dendritic cell immunobiology. In this article we introduce the DC-THERA Directory, which is an information system designed to support knowledge management for this research community and beyond. We present how the use of metadata and Semantic Web technologies can effectively help to organize the knowledge generated by modern collaborative research, how these technologies can enable effective data management solutions during and beyond the project lifecycle, and how resources such as the DC-THERA Directory fit into the larger context of e-science. © The Author(s) 2011.

The E-Curator project led by Museums and Collections at University College London took a practical, multidisciplinary approach to traceable storage and transmission of three-dimensional (3D) laser scan data sets. The objective was to establish protocols for retrievable data acquisition and processing to facilitate remote web-based access to museum e-artefacts and thereby enhance international scholarship. An Internet capable 3D visualization tool was designed, using state-of-the-art colour laser scanning technology for digitizing museum objects in combination with an e-science developed data storage and retrieval solution (Storage Resource Broker). The prototype was developed in discussion with a team of museum curators and conservators who were able to compare the handling of a range of real objects with their virtual copies on-screen. This article will explore two case studies of objects recorded with an Arius3D colour laser scanner and a handheld Metris K-Scan laser scanner to illustrate the 3D recording methodology and highlight how the developed system is capable of complementing traditional cataloguing and analysis methods for museum artefacts and enable digital repatriation. Anthropological research, based on observations from the example of the E-Curator project, is discussing the production, reception, and circulation of 3D digital objects and the networked technology of the digital image. © The Author 2011.

Few, if any, cloud providers or technologies offer quantitative performance guarantees. Regardless of the potential advantages of the cloud in comparison to enterprise-deployed applications, cloud infrastructures may ultimately fail if deployed applications cannot predictably meet behavioral requirements. In this paper, we present the results of comprehensive performance experiments we conducted on Windows Azure from October 2009 to February 2010. In general, we have observed good performance of the Windows Azure mechanisms, although the average 10 min VM startup time must be accounted for in application design. We also present performance and reliability observations and analysis from our deployment of a large-scale scientific application hosted on Azure, called ModisAzure, that show unusual and sporadic VM execution slowdown of over 4× in some cases and affected up to 16% of task executions at times. In addition to a detailed performance evaluation of Windows Azure, we provide recommendations for potential users of Windows Azure based on these early observations. Although the discussion and analysis is tailored to scientific applications, the results are broadly applicable to the range of existing and future applications running in Windows Azure. © 2011 IOS Press and the authors.

Current models range from single ion channels, through very complex models of individual cardiac cells, to geometrically and anatomically detailed models of the electrical activity in whole ventricles. A critical issue for model developers is how to choose parameters that allow the model to faithfully reproduce observed physiological effects without over-fitting. In this paper, we discuss the use of a parametric modelling toolkit, called NIMROD, that makes it possible both to explore model behaviour as parameters are changed and also to tune parameters by optimizing model output. Importantly, NIMROD leverages computers on the Grid, accelerating experiments by using available high-performance platforms.

We suggest that there are three steps that lead to environmental risk perceptions: acquisition of information, interpretation and synthesis of different pieces of information, and understanding of that information in light of previous knowledge, perceptions, or attitudes. In this study we presented 211 college students in the sciences and non-sciences with ecological and exposure information using text, tables and maps to examine the factors that affect information acquisition and interpretation concerning ecological issues at a fictitious hazardous waste site. Students were allowed about an hour to read the materials and answer questions. The percent of students answering each question correctly varied from 4 to 82%, indicating that some questions were extremely difficult to answer. We attributed these differences to variations in the number of places information was presented (in text, tables, maps, or a combination) and the complexity of the information (how many pieces of information were required to answer the question correctly). The correlation between the number of students answering each question correctly and these combined measures (frequency, complexity) was -0.72. Thus, although there were differences in accuracy concerning ecological information as presented in this study, the major differences were accounted for by how the information was presented, and how much information was required. This suggests that risk communicators should carefully determine which ecological information is critical for the target audience, and ensure that it is presented several times (in different forms). That a lower percentage of people correctly answered questions that required synthesizing several pieces of information suggests that this complexity should be reduced where possible, or that the pieces of information should be tied clearly to the conclusion. Self-declaration of effort and perceptions of safety of the site did not markedly influence the relationship between accuracy, difficulty of finding information, and complexity of information. Other possible confounding variables (i.e., science vs non-science major) only accounted for about 27% of the variation in student's overall score on ecological questions; age, ethnicity, and gender did not enter as significant variables. We cannot manage environmental hazards with appropriate stakeholder input unless we understand how to present environmental information to achieve a full understanding. Protection of human health and the environment requires that people understand ecological and exposure information, particularly on buffer lands. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Buffer lands; Exposure; Habitatuse; Information acquisition; Knowledge; Risk communication; Risk perception","Health risks; Information dissemination; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Information acquisition; Risk communication; Environmental impact; data acquisition; ecological impact; environmental hazard; environmental protection; environmental risk; habitat use; hazard assessment; hazardous waste; pollution exposure; risk perception; access to information; accuracy; adult; article; attitude to health; correlation analysis; environmental exposure; environmental health; female; frequency analysis; geographic distribution; hazardous waste; health behavior; health hazard; health survey; human; information processing; male; risk benefit analysis; safety; Adult; Data Collection; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Hazardous Substances; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Perception; Risk Assessment; United States","Burger, J.; Division of Life Sciences, 604 Allison Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8082, United States; email: burger@biology.rutgers.edu",,,01676369,,EMASD,"17622500","English","Environ.

However, currently great effort is being put into reducing the number of in-flight engine shutdowns, aborted take-offs and flight delays through the use of advanced engine health monitoring technology. This represents a benefit to society through reduced delays, reduced anxiety and reduced cost of ownership of aircraft. This is reflected in a change of emphasis within aero-engine companies where, instead of selling engines to customers, there is a fundamental shift to adoption of power-by-the-hour contracts. In these contracts, airlines make fixed regular payments based on the hours flown and the engine manufacturer retains responsibility for maintaining the engine. To support this new approach, improvements in in-flight monitoring of engines are being introduced with the collection of much more detailed data on the operation of the engine. At the same time advances have been made in Internet technologies providing a worldwide network of computers that can be used to access and process that data. The explosion of available knowledge within those large datasets also presents its own problems and here it is necessary to work on advanced decision support systems to identify the useful information in the data and provide knowledge-based advice between individual aircraft, airline repair and overhaul bases, world-wide data warehouses and the engine manufacturer. This paper presents a practical framework in which to build such a system that is inherent in the emerging Grid computing paradigm that provides the necessary computing resources.

We illustrate through a semantic web based knowledge management approach the potential of applying semantic web technologies in GEODISE, an e-Science pilot project in the domain of Engineering Design Search and Optimization (EDSO). In particular, we show how ontologies and semantically enriched instances are acquired through knowledge acquisition and resource annotation. This is illustrated not only in Protégé with an OWL plug-in, but also in a light weight function annotator customized for resource providers to semantically describe their own resources to be published. In terms of reuse, advice mechanisms, in particular a knowledge advisor based on semantic matching, are designed to consume the semantic information and facilitate service discovery, assembly and configuration in a real problem solving environment. An implementation has demonstrated the integration of the advisor in a text mode domain script editor and a GUI mode workflow composition environment.

Efficiently managing workflow applications on the Cloud computing data-centres is challenging due to the following problems: (i) they need to perform computation over sensitive data (e.g., Healthcare workflows) hence leading to additional security and legal risks especially considering public cloud environments and (ii) the dynamism of the cloud environment can lead to several run-time problems such as data loss and abnormal termination of workflow task due to failures of computing, storage, and network services. To tackle above challenges, this paper proposes a novel workflow management framework call Deploy on Federated Cloud Framework (DoFCF) that can dynamically partition scientific workflows across federated cloud (public/private) data-centres for minimising the financial cost, adhering to security requirements, while gracefully handling run-time failures. The framework is validated in cloud simulation tool (CloudSim) as well as in a realistic workflow-based cloud platform (e-Science Central). The results showed that our approach is practical and is successful in meeting users security requirements and reduces overall cost, and dynamically adapts to the run-time failures. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud federation; deployment; monetary cost; scheduling; scientific workflow optimisation; security","Cryptography; Data privacy; Health care; Public risks; Storage as a service (STaaS); Work simplification; Abnormal terminations; Cloud environments; Large scale scientific simulations; Real-world problem; Scientific workflows; Security requirements; Workflow applications; Workflow managements; Digital storage",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21687161,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

A questionnaire was administered to science students at the University of Auckland in New Zealand (N = 693) to test a theoretical model of science self-concept tied to the work of Pierre Bourdieu. In this model, a student's social capital (i.e., relationships with parents, teachers and peers) and cultural capital (i.e., science related resources) are seen as key determinants of a student's belief that science is a domain in which they can succeed. Results from a Structural Equation Model (SEM) show that, of the factors included in the model, exposure to passionate science teachers during high school was the main predictor of science self-concept for our sample of university science students, while having peers who value science was also found to be important. Interestingly, science-related resources and parents' value of science were not significant predictors of science self-concept, but the number of university generations in the family did have a positive association. Students who self-identified as male had higher levels of science self-concept, even after accounting for social and cultural factors in our theoretical model. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of the field of science education and Bourdieu's sociological theory. © Copyright © 2020 Turnbull, Meissel, Locke and O'Neale.","cultural capital; gender; habitus; higher education; science capital; science education; self-concept; social capital",,"Turnbull, S.M.; Faculty of Education and Social Work, New Zealand; email: s.turnbull@auckland.ac.nz

However, predicting the execution times of e-Science workflows in heterogeneous distributed systems is a challenging job due to the complex structure of workflows, variations due to input problem-sizes, and heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the shared resources. To this end, we propose two novel workflow execution time-prediction methods based on the machine learning ensemble models. In this paper, we showcase our approach for two different real Grid environments. Our approach can effectively predict the execution time of the scientific workflow applications in the Grid for various problem sizes, Grid sites, and runtime environments. We characterized the workflow performance in the Grid using the attributes that define structure of workflow as well as the execution environment. Contrary to common ensembles, our ensemble systems employed three strong learners, which balance the weaknesses of each other by their strengths to model the workflow execution times. The proposed methods have been thoroughly evaluated for three real-world e-science workflow applications. The experimental results demonstrated that our proposed multi-model ensemble models can significantly decrease the prediction error (by 50%, on average) as compared with methods based on the radial basis function neural network, local learning, and performance templates. The proposed methods can also be applied with similar effectiveness and without any major modification for other heterogeneous distributed environments, such as the Cloud. © 2013 IEEE.","distributed execution of e-science workflows; execution time prediction of e-science workflows; Machine learning ensemble systems; performance modeling of e-science workflows","Machine learning; Radial basis function networks; Distributed environments; E-science workflows; Ensemble systems; Execution environments; Heterogeneous distributed systems; Performance templates; Radial basis function neural networks; Workflow applications; Forecasting","Nadeem, F.; Department of Information Systems, Saudi Arabia; email: fabdullatif@kau.edu.sa",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062700783

Analytical equations that enable us to set the best constraints to properly reduce processing time and hence optimize signal searches play a crucial role in this matter. These are increasingly important because the production of unbiased samples from variability indices and statistical parameters has not been achievable so far. We discuss the constraints used in periodic signals detection methods as well as the uncertainties in the estimation of periods and amplitudes. The frequency resolution necessary to investigate a time series is assessed with a new approach that estimates the necessary sampling resolution from shifts on the phase diagrams for successive frequency grid points. We demonstrate the underlying meaning of the oversampling factor. We reassess the frequency resolutions required to find the variability periods of EA stars and use the new resolutions to analyse a small sample of EAup Catalina stars, i.e. EA stars previously classified as having insufficient number of observations at the eclipses. As a result, the variability periods of four EAup stars were determined. Moreover, we have a new approach to estimate the amplitude and period variations. From these estimations, information about the intrinsic variations of the sources is obtained. For a complete characterization of the light-curve signal, the period uncertainty and period variation must be determined. Constraints on periodic signal searches were analysed and delimited. © 2018 The Author(s).

In particular, there is increasing collaboration among researchers, which has led to the increasing use of processing techniques and the need to share results and observations. Researchers usually need to compose experiments using available services to fulfill their requirements. However, finding and/or specifying scientific applications is not a trivial task and many scientists lack the computational knowledge necessary to compose their experiments. [Objective] Therefore, the objective of this work is to develop an infrastructure in which researchers can work with heterogeneous information, accessing scientific communities according to their interests. As a result, they can create new experiments with the help of compositions of semantic web services. [Methods] Considering the infrastructure model, a prototype was specified and evaluated in a real-world context. [Results] This evaluation found evidence for the feasibility of the use of this infrastructure in scientific scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed platform where scientists can collaborate in order to specify an experiment and share its results, considering semantic information.

In the past decade, e-Science has rapidly developed around the world. There are now e-Science strategic plans, projects and extensive research activities on the national and international scales that encompass particle physics, astronomy, earth science, ecology, marine science, medicine, life sciences and other disciplines. However, there is no uniform and clear understanding of the essence, characteristics, infrastructure and application of e-Geoscience. This paper first discusses and analyzes the development of e-Science in a global context and then explores its development in China. Next, the development of e-Geoscience is discussed, particularly regarding the details of its design and implementation in China, including a conceptual model, a mode of application, a logical hierarchy, and functional and technical systems. Finally, the paper introduces a typical application, called the Northeast Asia Joint Scientific Exploration and Cooperative Research Platform (NAJSECRP), which is operating in research institutions in China, Russia and Mongolia. This platform can not only provide geodata and bibliographies and promote resource sharing but also provides a collaborative research platform for scientific exploration. In practice, this platform has been shown to save costs and improve the efficiency of transnational, interdisciplinary scientific exploration and cooperative research. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Big data; Cloud computing; e-Geoscience; e-Science; Information sharing; Internet of Things (IoT); Northeast Asia","Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Earth (planet); Geology; Societies and institutions; E-geoscience; E-sciences; Information sharing; Internet of Things (IOT); Northeast Asia; Big data","Fang, S.; State Key Laboratory of Resources and Environmental Information Systems, China; email: fsfno1@163.com",,"Springer New York LLC",13873326,,,,"English","Inf.

Some authors have identified an ever-increasing use of the concept of ‘theoretical model’, stemming from the so-called semantic view of scientific theories. However, it can be recognised that, in didactics of science, there are over-simplified transpositions of the idea of model (and of other meta-theoretical ideas). In this sense, contemporary philosophy of science is often blurred or distorted in the science education literature. In this paper, we address the discussion around some meta-theoretical concepts that are introduced into didactics of science due to their perceived educational value. We argue for the existence of a ‘semantic family’, and we characterise four different versions of semantic views existing within the family. In particular, we seek to contribute to establishing a model-based didactics of science mainly supported in this semantic family. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,,"Ariza, Y.; Centro de Estudios de Filosofía e Historia de la Ciencia (CEFHIC), Argentina; email: angelyefrin@hotmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",09267220,,,,"English","Sci.

Nevertheless, it is a common practice for a MR/KB to periodically update its ontologies to their latest versions by “migrating” the available instance descriptions to the latest ontology versions. Such migrations incur gaps regarding the specificity of the migrated metadata, i.e. inability to distinguish those descriptions that should be reexamined (for possible specialization as consequence of the migration) from those for which no reexamination is justified. Consequently, there is a need for principles, techniques, and tools for managing the uncertainty incurred by such migrations, specifically techniques for (a) identifying automatically the descriptions that are candidates for specialization, (b) computing, ranking and recommending possible specializations, and (c) flexible interactive techniques for updating the available descriptions (and their candidate specializations), after the user (curator of the repository) accepts/rejects such recommendations. This problem is especially important for curated knowledge bases which have increased quality requirements (as in E-science). In this paper, we formalize the problem and propose principles, rules, and algorithms for realizing the aforementioned scenario, for the RDF/S framework.

Such events can cause critical and possibly fatal disruption of the electromagnetic systems on spacecraft and on ground-based structures such as electric power grids, so there is a clear need to understand the events in their totality as they propagate through space and time. The e-Science challenge posed is that the data was gathered by many observatories and communities that have hitherto not needed to work together. Firstly, this involves the problem of helping users to more easily find and understand the relevance of data, especially data from outside their domain. Secondly, it involves solving challenges of data integration.

The tool is designed to support creative thinking while providing the means for the user to evaluate the validity of the visualization in terms of statistical uncertainty. We present an overview of the application and the results of an evaluation exploring public health researchers' responses to maps as a new way of viewing familiar data, in particular the use of thematic maps with adjoining descriptive statistics and forest plots to support the generation and evaluation of new hypotheses. Methods: A series of qualitative evaluations involved one experienced researcher asking 21 volunteers to interact with the system to perform a series of relatively complex, realistic map-building and exploration tasks, using a 'think aloud' protocol, followed by a semi-structured interview The volunteers were academic epidemiologists and UK National Health Service analysts. Results: All users quickly and confidently created maps, and went on to spend substantial amounts of time exploring and interacting with system, generating hypotheses about their maps. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the tool is able to support creativity and statistical appreciation among public health professionals and epidemiologists building thematic maps. Software such as this, introduced appropriately, could increase the capability of existing personnel for generating public health intelligence. © Schattauer 2011.","Creativity; Epidemiology; Geographic information systems; Public health; Visualization","article; coding; creativity; epidemiology; female; geographic information system; human; interview; male; national health service; public health; statistics; task performance; thinking; uncertainty; United Kingdom; Clinical Coding; Creativeness; Epidemiology; Female; Geographic Information Systems; Great Britain; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Public Health; State Medicine; Task Performance and Analysis; Thinking; Uncertainty","Thew, S.

Multicasting has been typically considered for on-demand applications and services, e.g., video-on-demand, IPTV, etc., which usually require start of data transmission immediately. We consider that multicast sessions can be provisioned starting with flexible times and that the multicast client can specify a maximum allowed time by which all data needs to be delivered to destinations. This is true for e-Science and high-performance applications, in which data distribution is not necessarily immediate. In this paper, we study the problem of provisioning dynamic multicast data-distribution requests (MDDRs) with flexible scheduling over optical WDM networks. We consider the practical case of fractional-capacity multicast sessions that require less than the entire wavelength capacity (nodes are equipped with multicast-capable opaque switches). We devise provisioning methods based on the multicast tree (or light-tree) distribution model. In our first approach (named Rand), we generate multiple randomized alternate trees on which we try to provision the multicast session and then assign wavelengths and schedule the session. In our second approach (named AllSlots), we dynamically generate light-trees depending on the network state. In our next approach (named Break), when provisioning an entire tree fails, we try to break the tree into time-independent subtrees. We also study the impact of allowing data to be buffered at intermediary nodes and then transmitted toward destinations (method named Buffer) and consider an approach that partitions the data sets. Finally, we study the impact of the switch architecture on our provisioning by restricting our approaches to full-wavelength MDDRs. © 2010 Optical Society of America.","Bandwidth granularities; Flexible scheduling; Large-scale data distribution; Multicast requests; Optical network; Scientific computing applications","Data distribution; Flexible scheduling; Multicast request; Optical networks; Scientific computing applications; Real time systems; Scheduling; Wavelength division multiplexing; Multicasting","Andrei, D.; University of California, Davis, CA 95616, United States; email: andrei@cs.ucdavis.edu",,,19430620,,,,"English","J.of Opt.

However, adoption of Semantic Web technologies is limited and user perception from the non-IT domain sceptical. Furthermore, little attention has been given to evaluating semantic browsers with real users to demonstrate the enhancements and obtain valuable feedback. The Sealife project investigates semantic browsing and its application to the life science domain. Sealife's main objective is to develop the notion of context-based information integration by extending three existing Semantic Web browsers (SWBs) to link the existing Web to the eScience infrastructure. Methods: This paper describes a user-centred evaluation framework that was developed to evaluate the Sealife SWBs that elicited feedback on users' perceptions on ease of use and information findability. Three sources of data: i) web server logs; ii) user questionnaires; and iii) semi-structured interviews were analysed and comparisons made between each browser and a control system. Results: It was found that the evaluation framework used successfully elicited users' perceptions of the three distinct SWBs. The results indicate that the browser with the most mature and polished interface was rated higher for usability, and semantic links were used by the users of all three browsers. Conclusion: Confirmation or contradiction of our original hypotheses with relation to SWBs is detailed along with observations of implementation issues. © 2009 Oliver et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Feedback; Semantic Web; Surveys; Context-based information; E-science infrastructures; Evaluation framework; Semantic Browser; Semantic browsing; Semantic Web technology; Semi structured interviews; Users' perception; Web browsers; access to information; article; bioinformatics; biomedicine; biotechnology; computer language; data analysis; human computer interaction; information processing; information retrieval; Internet; semi structured interview; web browser","Oliver, H.; City eHealth Research Centre, , London, EC1V 0HB, United Kingdom; email: Helen.oliver.1@city.ac.uk",,"BioMed Central",14712105,,BBMIC,"19796398","English","BMC Bioinform.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449389609

Problem solving systems typically comprise many agents, each characterized by at least partial autonomy. A challenge for problem solving systems is to coordinate system agent operations during problem solving. This paper explores how competence models of human-human and animal-animal coordination might be used to inform the design of problem solving systems so that the potential for agent coordination is enhanced. System design principles are identified based on a review of competent coordination in human groups, such as work and sport teams, and animal groups, such wolf packs and bee colonies. These principles are then discussed in relation to agent coordination in the domains of E-Science, future combat systems, and medicine, which typify real-world environments comprising problem solving systems. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The portal targets researchers and decision makers, enabling them to execute and couple their computational models in a workflow. The portal provides a framework which allows seamless integration of the models, meaning that each phase of the flow may be executed by a different expert and that the resulting data are shared among other portal users. Due to the nature of these applications and the need to execute many prospective scenarios, their execution requires high computing power. However, we go beyond providing high-performance computational Grid capabilities. We also enable people to complement each other's expertise in understanding the trade-offs in the water allocation decisions.

Such an integrated catalogue should enable researchers to solve problems or analyse phenomena that require a view across several scientific domains. Design/methodology/approach: There are two main approaches for integrating metadata catalogues provided by different e-science research infrastructures (e-RIs): centralised and distributed. The authors decided to implement a central metadata catalogue that describes, provides access to and records actions on the assets of a number of e-RIs participating in the system. The authors chose the CERIF data model for description of assets available via the integrated catalogue. Analysis of popular metadata formats used in e-RIs has been conducted, and mappings between popular formats and the CERIF data model have been defined using an XML-based tool for description and automatic execution of mappings. Findings: An integrated catalogue of research assets metadata has been created. Metadata from e-RIs supporting Dublin Core, ISO 19139, DCAT-AP, EPOS-DCAT-AP, OIL-E and CKAN formats can be integrated into the catalogue. Metadata are stored in CERIF RDF in the integrated catalogue. A web portal for searching this catalogue has been implemented. Research limitations/implications: Only five formats are supported at this moment. However, description of mappings between other source formats and the target CERIF format can be defined in the future using the 3M tool, an XML-based tool for describing X3ML mappings that can then be automatically executed on XML metadata records. The approach and best practices described in this paper can thus be applied in future mappings between other metadata formats. Practical implications: The integrated catalogue is a part of the eVRE prototype, which is a result of the VRE4EIC H2020 project. Social implications: The integrated catalogue should boost the performance of multi-disciplinary research; thus it has the potential to enhance the practice of data science and so contribute to an increasingly knowledge-based society. Originality/value: A novel approach for creation of the integrated catalogue has been defined and implemented. The approach includes definition of mappings between various formats. Defined mappings are effective and shareable. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CERIF; Metadata catalog; Online catalogs; Virtual research environments; Vocabulary homogenization; X3ML tools","article; data science; human; interdisciplinary research; metadata; vocabulary","Ivanović, D.; euroCRISNetherlands; email: chenejac@uns.ac.rs",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",02640473,,ELLID,,"English","Electron.

(1993, 1996) is an ionospheric regional model for predicting the vertical-sounding characteristics that has been frequently used in developing ionospheric web prediction services (Zolesi and Cander, 2014). Recently the model and its outputs were implemented in the framework of two European projects: DIAS (DIgital upper Atmosphere Server; http://www.iono.noa.gr/DIAS/) (Belehaki et al., 2005, 2015) and ESPAS (Near-Earth Space Data Infrastructure for e-Science; http://www.espas-fp7.eu/) (Belehaki et al., 2016). In this paper an updated version of the SIRM model, called SIRMPol, is described and corresponding outputs in terms of the F2-layer critical frequency (foF2) are compared with values recorded at the mid-latitude station of Rome (41.8°N, 12.5°E), for extremely high (year 1958) and low (years 2008 and 2009) solar activity. The main novelties introduced in the SIRMPol model are: (1) an extension of the Rome ionosonde input dataset that, besides data from 1957 to 1987, includes also data from 1988 to 2007; (2) the use of second order polynomial regressions, instead of linear ones, to fit the relation foF2 vs. solar activity index R 12 ; (3) the use of polynomial relations, instead of linear ones, to fit the relations A 0 vs. R 12 , A n vs. R 12 and Y n vs. R 12 , where A 0 , A n and Y n are the coefficients of the Fourier analysis performed by the SIRM model to reproduce the values calculated by using relations in (2). The obtained results show that SIRMPol outputs are better than those of the SIRM model. As the SIRMPol model represents only a partial updating of the SIRM model based on inputs from only Rome ionosonde data, it can be considered a particular case of a single-station model. Nevertheless, the development of the SIRMPol model allowed getting some useful guidelines for a future complete and more accurate updating of the SIRM model, of which both DIAS and ESPAS could benefit. © 2017 COSPAR","Critical frequency of the F2 layer; DIAS; ESPAS; Ionosonde; SIRM model; Solar activity","Fourier analysis; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Upper atmosphere; DIAS; ESPAS; F2 layer; Ionosonde; Solar activity; Radiosondes","Pezzopane, M.; Università di Bologna “Alma Mater Studiorum”, Viale Berti Pichat 6/2, Italy; email: michael.pezzopane@ingv.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",02731177,,ASRSD,,"English","Adv.

This may lead to higher prices for accessing the content via mobile devices, as mobile operators are capping mobile data billing plans in an effort to increase their revenues and prevent congestion. This poses problems for the users that are not willing/do not afford to pay the required price but still want to use multimedia content through the mobile networks. A price reduction for the user, as well as minimising bandwidth consumption can be obtained as a trade-off in multimedia quality. However, as previous research shows, not all people are willing to trade-off quality for a lower price; therefore, there is no straightforward approach to this problem. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to present a model of user willingness to pay for multimedia content quality as a function of the user risk attitude with the aim to provide personalised content depending on the user willingness to trade-off price for multimedia content quality. Design/methodology/approach – A user model was proposed based on a literature review and an existing data set. A stereotypical approach was used where users are divided in two groups: risk averse and risk seekers. An experimental study involving six scenarios was used to validate the findings. Findings – The results of the evaluation show that for the proposed user risk model, risk seekers preferred to pay for multimedia quality, whereas risk adverse users preferred to switch to a lower multimedia quality when monetary cost is involved. However, when the mobile data billing plan had the bandwidth limited, rather than a higher price to be paid when the bundle quantity was exceeded, the risk averse people’s preference for a lower quality still holds, but it does not show that most of the risk seekers prefer to pay for the multimedia quality. Research limitations/implications – This paper adds to the state of the art by providing a novel way to model the user preferences for multimedia quality based on their attitude towards risk, age, and gender. Practical implications – Mobile data users, content providers (application service providers, over-the-top providers), mobile network operators (MNOs) and internet service providers (ISPs) could benefit from the results of this research. For mobile data users, the outcome of this research could be beneficial, as they can obtain personalised content based on their needs. From the content providers’ point of view, providing personalised content can lead to more satisfied users. It could also reduce the bandwidth consumption and the traffic to the server and/or proxy. Reducing the bandwidth consumption could lead to the possibility to acquire more customers and hence increase the revenues. Originality/value – This is among the first studies to assess how the user preference towards multimedia quality if affected by the user attitude towards risk. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case study; Consumer behaviour/choice/demand/empowerment/reviews/consumerism; E-science; End user; Evaluation; Gender; Mobile systems; Personality",,"Molnar, A.; Department of Engineering, United States; email: andreea.molnar@asu.edu",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",09593845,,,,"English","Inf.

In particular, science gateways have gained increasing interest from the e-Science community. These gateways allow hiding the complexity of the underlying resources that give support to the management of scientific data and to the execution of scientific applications. Based on our previous experience with the development of science gateways for diverse application domains in the Brazilian national high-performance computing network (SINAPAD), we have devised a rapid prototyping strategy to lower the barrier for scientific application developers to launch new science gateways. This strategy is based on two main tools. The first tool implements a gateway engine that can be configured by a small set of XML files. Such files completely define the desired functionality of a specific science gateway in the gateway engine. The gateway engine also offers other features not commonly found in related technologies, such as file sharing, data provenance tracking, and restricted anonymous access to underlying computational resources. The second tool implements both an editor and a packager for the aforementioned engine. This tool allows the developer to rapidly deploy and launch a new science gateway in ordinary Web application containers. In this paper, we present our results with the use of both tools in the SINAPAD network. We also discuss about the current limitations of both tools, as well as how we have been dealing with such limitations to provide a more comprehensive toolset to developers.

Web services may be delivered by third parties, and thus are candidates for outsourcing. However, they represent a source of risks, which can jeopardise the robustness of processes. Hence, there is a need for actions which can contribute to the mitigation of possible threats to the continuity of processes. In this paper, risk affecting processes are classified, followed by a discussion about particular changes stemming from web services. Three distinct approaches allowing improvements are described: a newly proposed web services monitoring framework supported by a software solution, the concept of resilient web services, which specifies new design requirements for web services, and digital preservation strategies, which apart from long-term benefits can support sustainability of currently running processes.

One of its main challenges is that the middleware driving this production infrastructure is constantly evolving, as it adapts to the changing needs of the EGI Community. Since the software is provided by external technology providers, it needs to pass through a quality verification process before it is included in the EGI official release called Unified Middleware Distribution (UMD). Therefore, all software components undergo a release process covering the definition of the functionality and quality criteria, the verification of those criteria, and the testing under production environments. This paper details the design, development and implementation of this software validation process. An analysis is performed on several metrics to evaluate the process impact on the stability of the production infrastructure, by capturing malfunctions and other issues at the initial testing phases. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Grid infrastructures; Grid middleware; Software validation","Middleware; Verification; Computing resource; Grid infrastructures; GRID middleware; Production environments; Quality verification; Software component; Software validation; Technology providers; Software testing","David, M.; Laboratório de Instrumentação e Física Experimental de Partículas (LIP)Portugal",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",15707873,,,,"English","J.

How successful are we at applying this steady accumulation of scientific knowledge and so improving the practice of medicine in the USA?. Discussion. The conventional wisdom is that the US healthcare system is plagued by serious cost, access, safety and quality weaknesses. A comprehensive solution must involve the better translation of an abundance of clinical research into improved clinical practice. Yet the application of knowledge (i.e. technology) remains far less well funded and less visible than the generation, synthesis and accumulation of knowledge (i.e. science), and the two are only weakly integrated. Worse, technology is often seen merely as an adjunct to practice, e.g. electronic health records. Several key changes are in order. A helpful first step lies in better understanding the distinction between science and technology, and their complementary strengths and limitations. The absolute level of funding for technology development must be increased as well as being more integrated with traditional science-based clinical research. In such a mission-oriented federal funding strategy, the ties between basic science research and applied research would be better emphasized and strengthened. Summary. It bears repeating that only by applying the wealth of existing and future scientific knowledge can healthcare delivery and patient care ever show significant improvement. © 2012 Szczerba and Huesch; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article; biomedical technology assessment; economics; evidence based medicine; health care delivery; health care quality; human; information dissemination; mass communication; medical research; organization; practice guideline; standard; technology; time; translational research; United States; Biomedical Research; Delivery of Health Care; Diffusion of Innovation; Evidence-Based Medicine; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Information Dissemination; Organizational Culture; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Technology Assessment, Biomedical; Technology Transfer; Time Factors; Translational Medical Research; United States","Huesch, M.D.; USC Leonard D.

Enhanced collaboration, ad hoc access to tools, data and high-performance processing facilities are some of the gains to be made. Scientific workflows are concerned with, amongst others, supporting the repeatability and provenance of experiments. In context of three sets of research (wildfire research, flood modelling and the linking of disease outbreaks to multi-scale environmental conditions), we describe our efforts to provide geospatial capability for scientific workflow software environments to support researchers in exploring, integrating and visualising earth observation and geographic data in conjunction with other research data. We note that functionalities for data ingest (raster and vector), data transformation (reprojection and simplification), data export and spatial overlay operations commonly are required. We find a relative lack of support for geospatial data, services and these functions within several Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) scientific workflow packages. Furthermore, we highlight some software development and data encoding challenges faced when utilising various FOSS geospatial libraries within these scientific workflow environments. Finally, we offer suggestions for improving the integration of geospatial data as well as processing and analysis software tools into such environments. © Società Italiana di Fotogrammetria e Topografia (SIFET) 2011.","Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial; Geospatially enabled scientific workflows","data processing; GIS; performance assessment; research work; software; spatial analysis; spatial data","McFerren, G.; ICT4EO Research Group, , Pretoria, South Africa; email: gmcferren@csir.co.za",,"Springer Verlag",18669298,,,,"English","Appl.

Knowledge Spaces combine approaches that have demonstrated success in automating parts of this integration activity, including content management systems for domain-neutral management of data, workflow technologies for management of computation and analysis, and semantic web technologies for extensible, portable, citable management of descriptive information and other metadata. Tupelo's 'Context' facility and its associated semantic operations both allow existing data representations and tools to be plugged in, and also provide a semantic 'glue' of important associative relationships that span the research record, such as provenance, social networks, and annotation. Tupelo has enabled the recent work creating e-Science cyberenvironments to serve distributed, active scientific communities, allowing researchers to develop, coordinate and share datasets, documents, and computational models, while preserving process documentation and other contextual information needed to produce an integrated research record suitable for distribution and archiving.

Digitization is never neutral, and this article presents how, within the e-Science and Ancient Documents project (eSAD), we are developing a software tool that strives to support the act of interpretation while both avoiding spurious exactitude and allowing genuine uncertainty. We first assert that digitization is both sampling and interpreting. Our model of papyrological interpretation thus takes on board the types of expertise that papyrologists draw onto while interpreting ancient and scarcely legible documents. Mimesis serving as a guiding principle, we present how we digitize our text-bearing artefacts (in particular incised documents), taking into account the real-world strategies of the experts. We then argue that, throughout the interpretation process, uncertainty plays a key role, which we illustrate with the example of a Roman stylus tablet that was interpreted twice 92 years apart. To allow the expression of uncertainty, we show how mimesis is again our design strategy: our tool aims to enable the experts to trace the text-a strategy we observed them deploying; further it will support reasoning about hypotheses of interpretation by setting an epistemological framework in which pieces of evidence towards hypotheses of interpretation can be evaluated as in crossword puzzle solving-another expert strategy. © The Author 2011.

In general, a workflow is defined as set of atomic tasks that may have dependencies between each other. Tasks also may define a so-called ""quorum"" which denotes a number of precedence constraints to be fulfilled before execution may proceed. To solve the problem of designing a quorum that fits a scalable and dynamic environment where data are distributed sparsely or too far apart, we propose a cell approximation method to fit into some form (e.g., voting, grid) of logical structure in quorum-based protocols. In our method, adjacent nodes are configured by an Intra cell which can improve their data locality. Furthermore, Intra-cell relationships can be represented by an Inter cell for minimizing access time. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Cell approximation; Data grid; Quorum system","Access time; Adjacent nodes; Approximation methods; Consensus methods; Data Grid; Data locality; Data sets; Dynamic environments; e-Science; Grid infrastructures; Logical structure; Precedence constraints; Quorum system; Quorum systems; Quorum-based protocols; Replicated data; Service Oriented; Approximation theory; Large scale systems; Signal filtering and prediction","Lee, C.-H.; Dept. of Computer Engineering, , Daejeon 305-764, South Korea; email: clee@cnu.ac.kr",,,13867857,,,,"English","Cluster Comput.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450277234

Provisioning of end-to-end lightpaths in Grid networks is essential to e-Science applications requiring reliable transmission of massive amount of experimental data. Lightpath provisioning service can offer bandwidth guaranteed and dedicated connections to e-Science applications. It can also help collaboration within each research community. Furthermore, network resource management to control the link capacity and the allocation of capacity to connections allows research communities to use the limited network resources efficiently. Network resource management can be simplified by using GMPLS (generalized multiprotocol label switching), which automates end-to-end lightpath provisioning. In this paper, we propose an architecture for Grid network resource management system over GMPLS networks and a Grid network resource scheduling scheme supporting e-Science applications. The proposed system and scheme enables users to create their own controllable and dynamic end-to-end lightpaths.

However most technology enhanced learning and e-Science experiences to date have been designed and run by researchers. There is significant challenge in moving these experiences into the hands of teachers to become an everyday part of learning. One step forward is to understand better the work involved in making these learning experiences work. We present a retrospective analysis of two educational e-Science research projects, each involving access to and analysis of scientific data from remote and handheld sensors; collaboration; and reviewing shared data using advanced software tools. We identify key categories of work from the effort, resources and issues entailed in setting-up and running these experiences. We propose these categories can be used: to help plan other technology enhanced learning experiences, to be further tested and evolved in future research, and as a basis for an overall experience framework to capture the process- and context-related aspects in which these tasks are embedded.

The DNA damage response requires the coordinated interaction between DNA repair and checkpoint pathways. Telomeres of budding yeast are capped by the Cdc13 complex. In the temperature-sensitive cdc13-1 strain, telomeres are unprotected over a specific temperature range leading to activation of the DNA damage response and subsequently cell-cycle arrest. Inactivation of cdc13-1 results in the generation of long regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and is affected by the activity of various checkpoint proteins and nucleases. This paper describes a mathematical model of how uncapped telomeres in budding yeast initiate the checkpoint pathway leading to cell-cycle arrest. The model was encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) and simulated using the stochastic simulation system Biology of Ageing e-Science Integration and Simulation (BASIS). Each simulation follows the time course of one mother cell keeping track of the number of cell divisions, the level of activity of each of the checkpoint proteins, the activity of nucleases and the amount of ssDNA generated. The model can be used to carry out a variety of in silico experiments in which different genes are knocked out and the results of simulation are compared to experimental data. Possible extensions to the model are also discussed. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Checkpoint; Modelling; Stochastic; Systems biology; Telomere; Yeast","nuclease; single stranded DNA; article; budding; cell cycle; cell cycle arrest; cell division; computer model; DNA damage; enzyme activity; mathematical model; simulation; stochastic model; telomere; temperature sensitivity; yeast; Saccharomycetales","Proctor, C.J.; Institute for Ageing and Health, , Newcastle upon Tyne NE4 6BE, United Kingdom; email: c.j.proctor@ncl.ac.uk",,"Royal Society",17425689,,,"17015293","English","J.

To implement these workflows, developers are currently using different patterns; mainly task-based and dataflow. However, since these patterns are usually managed by separated frameworks, the implementation of these applications requires to combine them; considerably increasing the effort for learning, deploying, and integrating applications in the different frameworks. This paper tries to reduce this effort by proposing a way to extend task-based management systems to support continuous input and output data to enable the combination of task-based workflows and dataflows (Hybrid Workflows from now on) using a single programming model. Hence, developers can build complex Data Science workflows with different approaches depending on the requirements. To illustrate the capabilities of Hybrid Workflows, we have built a Distributed Stream Library and a fully functional prototype extending COMPSs, a mature, general-purpose, task-based, parallel programming model. The library can be easily integrated with existing task-based frameworks to provide support for dataflows. Also, it provides a homogeneous, generic, and simple representation of object and file streams in both Java and Python; enabling complex workflows to handle any data type without dealing directly with the streaming back-end. During the evaluation, we introduce four use cases to illustrate the new capabilities of Hybrid Workflows; measuring the performance benefits when processing data continuously as it is generated, when removing synchronisation points, when processing external real-time data, and when combining task-based workflows and dataflows at different levels.

One of the causes for remaining out of that field could lie on gender stereotypes. Undergraduate stereotypes and beliefs are important as could easily uphold future gender segregation at the workplace. In the research arena the measurement of those biased beliefs is important as most commonly used Likert scales (LS) could raise problems in terms of accuracy. As fuzzy rating scales (FRS) are a promising measurement alternative, the aim of this study is to compare the properties of FRS against LS. We conducted a cross-sectional study with 262 STEM and non-STEM participants who answered to a questionnaire that, besides gendered beliefs and injustice perception towards the situation of women at the workplace, included personal characteristics as coursed degree and working experience. Results pointed out, on one hand, that FRS allowed for a better capture of the variability of individual responses, but on the other hand, that LS were better valued than FRS in what is concerned with satisfaction and ease of response. Advantages of FRS for psychosocial measurement are discussed to facilitate the study around causes of segregation that excludes women from the STEM labour market. © 2020 by the authors.","Fuzzy rating scale; Gender equality; Likert scale; STEM studies; Stereotypes measurement","comparative study; fuzzy mathematics; gender; labor market; measurement method; perception; questionnaire survey","García-Izquierdo, A.L.; Department of Psychology, Spain; email: angarcia@uniovi.es",,"MDPI",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089915419

Research grant providers such as the European Union increasingly require open access publishing of research results and data. However, despite its significance to research, the adoption rate of open data technology remains low across all disciplines, especially in Europe where research has primarily focused on technical solutions (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework) or considered only parts of the issue. Methods and findings In this study, we emphasized the non-technical factors perceived value and uncertainty factors in the context of academia, which impact researchers’ acceptance of open data–the idea that researchers should not only publish their findings in the form of articles or reports, but also share the corresponding raw data sets. We present the results of a broad quantitative analysis including N = 995 researchers from 13 large to medium-sized universities in Germany. In order to test 11 hypotheses regarding researchers’ intentions to share their data, as well as detect any hierarchical or disciplinary differences, we employed a structured equation model (SEM) following the partial least squares (PLS) modeling approach. Conclusions Grounded in the value-based theory, this article proclaims that most individuals in academia embrace open data when the perceived advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Furthermore, uncertainty factors impact the perceived value (consisting of the perceived advantages and disadvantages) of sharing research data. We found that researchers’ assumptions about effort required during the data preparation process were diminished by awareness of e-science technologies (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework), which also increased their tendency to perceive personal benefits via data exchange. Uncertainty factors seem to influence the intention to share data. Effects differ between disciplines and hierarchical levels. © 2020 Stieglitz et al.

Since then, provenance and document context have supported the organization of archival knowledge (especially through classification and description procedures). Such relationships were gradually refined over the years and from different experiences between European archives and their classification and ordering systems. Historically, the principle of provenance is a pivotal moment in the development of archival theory, crucial to understanding the nature of records and archives. However, in archival theory, the principle of provenance still does not correspond to a single term or a single definition and scarce normalization terminology remains one of the problems of archival science, which leads to a lack of consensus about the division between the two principles of provenance and original order. Recently, the concept of provenance has been addressed by many other disciplines flaw, library and information science, computer science and visual analytics) and applied to different domains (cloud-based storage, preservation of digital records, digital evidence, digital humanities, e-science, open data, linked data, knowledge organization and indexing. As the use of provenance reaches new domains it is no longer just an organizing principle but also a means of reaching for authenticity and reliability of data and objects in digital environments or museums or to reestablish the original organic relationship in library collections. © 2019 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

The Unified Middleware Distribution (UMD) and Cloud Middleware Distribution (CMD) are the channels to deliver the software for the EGI e-Infrastructure consumption. The software is compiled, validated and distributed following the Software Provisioning Process (SWPP), where the Quality Criteria (QC) definition sets the minimum quality requirements for EGI acceptance. The growing number of software components currently existing within UMD and CMD distributions hinders the application of the traditional, manual-based validation mechanisms, thus driving the adoption of automated solutions. This paper presents umd-verification, an open-source tool that enforces the fulfillment of the QC requirements in an automated way for the continuous validation of the software products for scientific disposal. The umd-verification tool has been successfully integrated within the SWPP pipeline and is progressively supporting the full validation of the products in the UMD and CMD repositories. While the cost of supporting new products is dependant on the availability of Infrastructure as Code solutions to take over the deployment and high test coverage, the results obtained for the already integrated products are promising, as the time invested in the validation of products has been drastically reduced. Furthermore, automation adoption has brought along benefits for the reliability of the process, such as the removal of human-associated errors or the risk of regression of previously tested functionalities. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Automation; Continuous integration; Software quality assurance; Software quality control; Software testing; Software verification and validation","Application programs; Automation; Integration testing; Middleware; Open source software; Open systems; Quality assurance; Quality control; Software testing; Verification; Automation adoption; Continuous integrations; Integrated products; Quality requirements; Software quality assurance; Software quality control; Software validation; Software verification and validation; Computer software selection and evaluation","Orviz Fernández, P.; Instituto de Física de Cantabria, Spain; email: orviz@ifca.unican.es",,"Springer Netherlands",15707873,,,,"English","J.

Such analyses are modeled as scientific workflows — applications composed of many individual tasks that exhibit data dependencies. Typically, these applications suffer from significant variability in the interplay between achieved parallelism and data footprint. To efficiently tackle the data deluge, cost effective solutions need to be deployed by extending private computing infrastructures with public cloud resources. To achieve this, two key features for such systems need to be addressed: elasticity and network adaptability. The former improves compute resource utilization efficiency, while the latter improves network utilization efficiency, since public clouds suffer from significant bandwidth variability. This paper extends our previous work on MemEFS, an in-memory elastic distributed file system by adding network adaptability. Our results show that MemEFS’ elasticity increases the resource utilization efficiency by up to 65%. Regarding the network adaptation policy, MemEFS achieves up to 50% speedup compared to its network-agnostic counterpart. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Big data and HPC systems; Big data for e-Science; Distributed hashing; Elasticity; High-performance I/O; In-memory file system; Large-scale scientific computing; Large-scale systems for computational sciences; Network adaptation; Network variability; Scalable computing","Big data; Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Elasticity; File organization; Large scale systems; Computational science; Distributed hashing; E-sciences; File systems; High-performance I/O; Network adaptation; Scalable computing; Distributed computer systems","Uta, A.; Department of Computer Science, Netherlands; email: a.uta@vu.nl",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016194002

While domain researchers are experts in their field and apply sophisticated theoretical models in computational simulations, they are not necessarily also HPC experts or IT specialists in general. Thus, they appreciate easy-to-use solutions tailored to their research, which hide the complex underlying computing and data infrastructures. Science gateways form such end-to-end solutions and their development for compute-intensive simulations necessitates expertise to connect HPC research infrastructures including grid and cloud infrastructures to support with the efficient access to such resources. HPC experts and IT specialists fulfilling this task may have only rudimentary knowledge about the research domain of a simulation. Thus, it is crucial that they gather the requirements of a research use case, which they aim to support efficiently via a science gateway. In the last 10 years quite a few web development frameworks, science gateway frameworks and APIs with different foci and strengths have evolved to support the developers of science gateways in implementing an intuitive solution for a target research domain. The selection of a suitable technology for a specific use case is essential and helps reducing the effort in implementing the science gateway by re-using existing software or frameworks. Thus, a solution for a user community can be provided more efficiently. This paper introduces the general architecture of science gateways, goes into detail for criteria to design science gateways efficiently and gives examples of mature science gateways and science gateway frameworks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Applied modeling and simulation; Cloud computing and applications; e-Sciences; Internet and web computing; Large scale scientific computing; Large scale systems for computational sciences","Computation theory; Large scale systems; Web crawler; Computational science; Computational simulation; E-sciences; High performance computing (HPC); Internet and web computing; Model and simulation; Research infrastructure; Web development frameworks; Distributed computer systems","Gesing, S.; University of Notre Dame, United States; email: sandra.gesing@nd.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015395737

The objective of the methodology that was used was to combine the aspects that refer to spatial information and cultural items into a single, common issue, and to describe them in a formalized way with use of Unified Modeling Language (UML). As a result, the study presents a proposal of the Humanities Infrastructure Architecture based on spatially-oriented movable cultural items, taking into account their use in the context of interoperability, along with the concept of creating spatial databases that would include movable monuments.

This is an important context for studying nuanced adoption behaviours that define a digital divide. Large-scale studies are required to determine what behaviours exist in such populations, but can offer limited ability to draw inferences about why. The purpose of this paper is to report a large-scale study inside China that probes a nuanced “digital divide” behaviour: consumer demographics indicating ability to pay by electronic means but behaviour suggesting lack of willingness to do so, and extends current demographics to help explain this. Design/methodology/approach – The authors report trans-national access to commercial “Big Data” inside China capturing the demographics and consumption of millions of consumers across a wide range of physical and digital market channels. Focusing on one urban location we combine traditional demographics with a new measure that reflecting migration: “Distance from Home”, and use data-mining techniques to develop a model that predicts use behaviour. Findings – Use behaviour is predictable. Most use is explained by value of the transaction. “Distance from Home” is more predictive of technology use than traditional demographics. Research limitations/implications – Results suggest traditional demographics are insufficient to explain “why” use/non-use occurs and hence an insufficient basis to formulate and target government policy. Originality/value – The authors understand this to be the first large-scale trans-national study of use/non-use of digital channels within China, and the first study of the impact of distance on ICT adoption. © 2016, © Authors.

Commercial cloud providers are increasingly offering high performance and GPU-enabled resources that are ideal for many e-Science applications. However, the opacity of the cloud's internal network, while a necessity for elasticity, limits the options for e-Science programmers to build efficient and high performance codes. We introduce health indicators, markers, metrics, and score as part of a network health system that provides a model for describing the overall network health of an e-Science application. We then explore the suitability of a range of tomographic techniques to act as health indicators using two testbeds - the second of which spanned one hundred AWS instances. Finally, we evaluate our work using a real-world medical image reconstruction application. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Network health; Network tomography","Cloud computing; Health; Image reconstruction; Medical image processing; Medical imaging; Cloud providers; E-science applications; Health indicators; High performance codes; Internal network; Network tomography; Overall networks; Tomographic techniques; Distributed computer systems","Bubendorfer, K.; School of Engineering and Computer Science, New Zealand; email: kris@ecs.vuw.ac.nz",,"Elsevier",0167739X,,FGCSE,,"English","Future Gener Comput Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958898764

The key feature of xBook is that it can be used as an offline resource at remote sites during excavations and can be synchronized with a central server at any time. While some scientists can record data in xBook in the field where no internet connection is available, colleagues can already work with and analyse the previously synchronized data via the central server at any location in the world. Due to the modular implementation, any relational data schema can be implemented in xBook. This way, xBook provides a flexible data management service that is not tailored to a specific discipline or view but can be customized to any specific need to support e-Science applications. It could potentially be used in any application and offers the synchronization feature to any domain. Incarnations of the xBook framework are used in archaeology, and archaeobiology (anthropology and archaezoology).

Accurate and timely epidemic models require large, fresh datasets. The World Wide Web, due to its explosion in data availability, represents a valuable source for epidemiological datasets. From an e-science perspective, collected data can be shared across multiple applications to enable the creation of dynamic platforms to extract knowledge from these datasets. Our approach, MEDCollector, addresses this problem by enabling data collection from multiple sources and its upload to the repository of an epidemic research information platform. Enabling the flexible use and configuration of services through workflow definition, MEDCollector is adaptable to multiple Web sources. Identified disease and location entities are mapped to ontologies, not only guaranteeing the consistency within gathered datasets but also allowing the exploration of relations between the mapped entities.

These datasets consist of petabytes of raw data and billions of documents. Yet to the best of our knowledge, a search engine technology that searches and cross-links all different data types in life sciences does not exist. We have developed a prototype distributed scientific search engine technology, 'Sciencenet', which facilitates rapid searching over this large data space. By 'bringing the search engine to the data', we do not require server farms. This platform also allows users to contribute to the search index and publish their large-scale data to support e-Science. Furthermore, a community-driven method guarantees that only scientific content is crawled and presented.

By controlling the generation and running of different configurations through a database engine, we are able to not only analyse the data on the fly but also direct the running of jobs and the algorithms for generating further structures. As an exemplar case, we probe the distribution of Al and extra-framework cations in the structure of the zeolite Mordenite. We compare our computed unit cells with experiment and find that whilst there is excellent correlation between computed and experimentally derived unit cell volumes, cation positioning and short-range Al ordering (i.e. near neighbour environment), there remains some discrepancy in the distribution of Al throughout the framework. We also show that stabilitystructure correlations only become apparent once a sufficiently large sample is used. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This concept implies studying a huge size of data from heavy flavor physics anytime and anywhere even if we are not on-site in accelerator laboratories. The components of this concept include data production, data processing, and data analysis. We apply this concept to the current CDF experiment at Tevatron.

Through a year-long consultation with UK researchers, a coherent strategy has been developed, which will nurture Century-of-Information Research (CIR); it crystallises the ideas developed by the e-Science Directors' Forum Strategy Working Group. This paper is an abridged version of their latest report which can be found at: http://wikis.nesc.ac.uk/escienvoy/ Century_of_Information_Research_Strategy which also records the consultation process and the affiliations of the authors. This document is derived from a paper presented at the Oxford e-Research Conference 2008 and takes into account suggestions made in the ensuing panel discussion. The goals of the CIR Strategy are to facilitate the growth of UK research and innovation that is data and computationally intensive and to develop a new culture of 'digital-systems judgement' that will equip research communities, businesses, government and society as a whole, with the skills essential to compete and prosper in the Century of Information. The CIR Strategy identifies a national requirement for a balanced programme of coordination, research, infrastructure, translational investment and education to empower UK researchers, industry, government and society. The Strategy is designed to deliver an environment which meets the needs of UK researchers so that they can respond agilely to challenges, can create knowledge and skills, and can lead new kinds of research. It is a call to action for those engaged in research, those providing data and computational facilities, those governing research and those shaping education policies. The ultimate aim is to help researchers strengthen the international competitiveness of the UK research base and increase its contribution to the economy. The objectives of the Strategy are to better enable UK researchers across all disciplines to contribute world-leading fundamental research; to accelerate the translation of research into practice; and to develop improved capabilities, facilities and context for research and innovation. It envisages a culture that is better able to grasp the opportunities provided by the growing wealth of digital information. Computing has, of course, already become a fundamental tool in all research disciplines. The UK e-Science programme (2001-06)-since emulated internationally-pioneered the invention and use of new research methods, and a new wave of innovations in digital-information technologies which have enabled them. The Strategy argues that the UK must now harness and leverage its own, plus the now global, investment in digital-information technology in order to spread the benefits as widely as possible in research, education, industry and government. Implementing the Strategy would deliver the computational infrastructure and its benefits as envisaged in the Science & Innovation Investment Framework 2004-2014 (July 2004), and in the reports developing those proposals. To achieve this, the Strategy proposes the following actions: 1. support the continuous innovation of digital-information research methods; 2. provide easily used, pervasive and sustained e-Infrastructure for all research; 3. enlarge the productive research community which exploits the new methods efficiently; 4. generate capacity, propagate knowledge and develop skills via new curricula; and 5. develop coordination mechanisms to improve the opportunities for interdisciplinary research and to make digital-infrastructure provision more cost effective. To gain the best value for money strategic coordination is required across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. A coherent strategy is essential in order to establish and sustain the UK as an international leader of well-curated national data assets and computational infrastructure, which is expertly used to shape policy, support decisions, empower researchers and to roll out the results to the wider benefit of society. The value of data as a foundation for wellbeing and a sustainable society must be appreciated; national resources must be more wisely directed to the collection, curation, discovery, widening access, analysis and exploitation of these data. Every researcher must be able to draw on skills, tools and computational resources to develop insights, test hypotheses and translate inventions into productive use, or to extract knowledge in support of governmental decision making. This foundation plus the skills developed will launch significant advances in research, in business, in professional practice and in government with many consequent benefits for UK citizens.

Portlets can be reused by different projects, e.g. the high-profile Integrative Biology project (with the University of Oxford), and in different Java Specification Request 168 Portlet Specification (JSR 168) compliant portal frameworks. Deployment and maintenance of applications developed as portlets becomes easier and manageable. A community process is already beginning and many portal frameworks come with free-to-use useful portlets. As rendering is carried out in the framework, applications can be easily accessible and internationalized. Portlets are compatible with J2EE, thus providing additional capabilities required in the service-oriented architecture (SOA). We also describe how Web service gateways can be used to provide many of the functionalities encapsulated in a portal server in a way to support Grid applications. Portals used as a rich client can allow users to customize or personalize their user interfaces and even their workflow and application access. CCLRC facilities will be able to leverage the work so far carried out on the National Grid Service (NGS) and e-HTPX portals, as they are fully functional and have received detailed user feedback. This demonstrates the usefulness of providing advanced capabilities for e-Research and having the associated business logic in a SOA loosely coupled from the presentation layer for an Integrated e-Science Environment.

The growing share and importance of freely accessible research output demands new approaches/metrics for measuring and evaluating these new types of scientific publication.

While students of secondary provision in many developed countries enjoy the liberty of choosing their desired subjects from different areas (i.e., science, business, and arts), students in some developing counterparts are restricted to consider one cluster. With a policy support, students of the science cluster can procure higher education (HE) in any area, while students from other clusters are restricted to study HE in their respective area only. By virtue of this policy, the limited scope of HE and jobs in the areas of business and arts is being occupied by science graduates because of one-way traffic that favors science cluster. This has a grave impact on the HE and job market, which is the central focus of this research. We failed to find such studies conducted in the context of a developing nation. Considering this, the article is the first of its kind. Given the differentiated nature of research questions, multiple techniques were used to collect the data. However, this research bears the norms of qualitative method. Findings confirm that having been denied access to HE, secondary graduates especially from the business cluster, dropped out without furthering their education. This has deteriorated the quality of HE and job performance—more precisely, it has deprived students of the business and arts clusters. This research suggests a revision of the prevailing policy to address these constraints. © The Author(s) 2020.","clustering system in education; education and development; rights in education; secondary education",,"Alam, G.M.; Department of Foundations of Education, Malaysia; email: gazimalamb@yahoo.com",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",10567879,,,,"English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach: Content analysis of research publications on data science was made of papers published in the Web of Science database to identify the main themes discussed in the publications from the LIS perspective. Findings: A content analysis of 80 publications is presented. The articles belonged to the six broad categories: data science education and training; knowledge and skills of the data professional; the role of libraries and librarians in the data science movement; tools, techniques and applications of data science; data science from the knowledge management perspective; and data science from the perspective of health sciences. The category of tools, techniques and applications of data science was most addressed by the authors, followed by data science from the perspective of health sciences, data science education and training and knowledge and skills of the data professional. However, several publications fell into several categories because these topics were closely related. Research limitations/implications: Only publication recorded in the Web of Science database and with the term “data science” in the topic area were analyzed. Therefore, several relevant studies are not discussed in this paper that either were related to other keywords such as “e-science”, “e-research”, “data service”, “data curation”, “research data management” or “scientific data management” or were not present in the Web of Science database.

Computer based diagnosis may play a major role in the early detection and in tracking and even development of efficient pathological speech diagnosis, based on a computerized acoustic evaluation. The health of the Voice is assessed by several acoustic parameters. The exactness of these parameters is often linked to algorithms used to estimate them for speech noise identification. That is why main effort of the scientists is to study acoustic parameters and to apply classification methods that achieve a high precision in discrimination. The primary aim of this paper is for a meta-analysis on voice disorder databases i.e. SVD, MEEI and AVPD and machine learning techniques applied on it. Materials and Methods: This field of study was systematically reviewed in compliance with PRISMA guidelines. A search was performed with a set of formulated keywords on three databases i.e. Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Xplore. A proper screening and analysis of articles were performed after which several articles were also excluded. Results: Forty-five studies that fulfills the eligibility criteria were included in this meta-analysis. After applying eligibility criteria on the peer reviewed and research article and studies that were published in authentic journals and conferences proceedings till June 2020 were chosen for further full-text screening. In general, only those articles that used voice recordings from SVD, MEEI and AVPD databases as a dataset is included in this meta-analysis. Conclusion: We discussed the strengths and weaknesses of SVD, MEEI and AVPD. After detailed analysis of the studies including the techniques used and outcome measurements, it was also concluded that Support Vector Machine (SVM) is the most common used algorithm for the detection of voice disorders. Other than was also noticed that researchers focus on supervised techniques for the clinical diagnosis of voice disorder rather than using unsupervised techniques. It was also concluded that more work needs to be on voice pathology detection using AVPD database. © 2020 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

With the school principals' support, three primary science teachers' instructional practices are the subject of individual case studies. A range of qualitative methods and data sources including participant observations, individual and collective interviews, teacher and student artifacts were adapted to elicit evidence related to change of teaching practices and perceptions on action research activities. The case study analysis showed that collaborative action research enabled the primary science teachers to change their teaching practices within the classroom conditions. Factors that were identified as important to these changes included: 1) the primary teachers needed school leadership that powerfully attends to their professional development activities; and 2) the teachers needed a university coach to collaboratively reflect and suggest how to teach in the particular subject i.e. science. In the case of a primary teacher who, having no qualifications (i.e., certification-related teacher preparation) in science teaching, additionally needed a community of professional teachers willing to collaboratively reflect on classroom experiences for better inquiry into science teaching practices. As a means to sustain the changes in this educational context, implementing the collaborative action research while providing opportunities for parents to observe and reflect upon teachers' classroom teaching practices was also found to be important. © 2022 Asia-Pacific Science Education.

As case studies, we use personalized prostate and breast cancer screenings. Materials and Methods: We describe an e-Science initiative in Sweden, e-Science for Cancer Prevention and Control (eCPC), which supports biomarker discovery and offers decision support for personalized intervention strategies. The generic eCPC contribution is a workflow with 4 nodes applied iteratively, and the concept of e- Science signifies systematic use of tools from the mathematical, statistical, data, and computer sciences. Results: The eCPC workflow is illustrated through 2 case studies. For prostate cancer, an in-house personalized screening tool, the Stockholm-3 model (S3M), is presented as an alternative to prostate-specific antigen testing alone. S3M is evaluated in a trial setting and plans for rollout in the population are discussed. For breast cancer, new biomarkers based on breast density and molecular profiles are developed and the US multicenter Women Informed to Screen Depending on Measures (WISDOM) trial is referred to for evaluation. While current eCPC data management uses a traditional data warehousemodel, we discuss eCPC-developed features of a coherent data integration platform. Discussion and Conclusion: E-Science tools are a key part of an evidence-based process for personalized medicine. This paper provides a structured workflow from data and models to evaluation of new personalized intervention strategies. The importance of multidisciplinary collaboration is emphasized. Importantly, the generic concepts of the suggested eCPC workflow are transferrable to other disease domains, although each disease will require tailored solutions. © The Author 2017.

Geoscience is one of the first domains that take lead in initiatives such as open data, open code, open access, and open collections, which comprise key topics of Open Science in academia. The meaning of being open can be understood at two levels. The lower level is to make data, code, sample collections, and publications, etc., freely accessible online and allow reuse, modification, and sharing. The higher level is the annotation and connection between those resources to establish a network for collaborative scientific research. In the data science component of the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO), we have leveraged state-of-the-art information technologies and existing online resources to deploy a web portal for the over 1, 000 researchers in the DCO community. An initial aim of the portal is to keep track of all research and outputs related to the DCO community. Further, we intend for the portal to establish a knowledge network, which supports various stages of an open scientific process within and beyond the DCO community. Annotation and linking are the key characteristics of the knowledge network. Not only are key assets, including DCO data andmethods, published in an open and inter-linked fashion, but the people, organizations, groups, grants, projects, samples, field sites, instruments, software programs, activities, meetings, etc., are recorded and connected to each other through relationships based on well-defined, formal conceptual models. The network promotes collaboration among DCO participants, improves the openness and reproducibility of carbon-related research, facilitates accreditation to resource contributors, and eventually stimulates new ideas and findings in deep carbon-related studies. © 2017 Ma, West, Zednik, Erickson, Eleish, Chen,Wang, Zhong and Fox.","Data stewardship; eScience; Knowledge network; Ontologies; Semantic web","Carbon; Data Science; e-Science; Geology; Ontology; Portals; Semantic Web; Conceptual model; Data stewardship; Key characteristics; Knowledge networks; Reproducibilities; Sample collection; Scientific researches; State of the art; Open Data; carbon; information technology; knowledge; publishing; research program","Ma, X.; Department of Computer Science, United States; email: max@uidaho.edu",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",22966463,,,,"English","Front.

SWFs are executed by means of workflow management systems (WMSs), which orchestrate the workload on top of computing infrastructures. The advent of cloud computing infrastructures has opened the door of using on-demand infrastructures to complement or even replace local infrastructures. However, new issues have arisen, such as the integration of hybrid resources or the compromise between infrastructure reutilisation and elasticity. In this article, we present an ad hoc solution for managing workflows exploiting the capabilities of cloud orchestrators to deploy resources on demand according to the workload and to combine heterogeneous cloud providers (such as on-premise clouds and public clouds) and traditional infrastructures (clusters) to minimise costs and response time. The work does not propose yet another WMS but demonstrates the benefits of the integration of cloud orchestration when running complex workflows. The article shows several configuration experiments from a realistic comparative genomics workflow called Orthosearch, to migrate memory-intensive workload to public infrastructures while keeping other blocks of the experiment running locally. The article computes running time and cost suggesting best practices.

To have a better understanding of complex biological networks and existing relationships among the components, network models have been using for a long time. Complex networks from diverse scopes like Sociology or Biology exist in many e-science data sets. Mostly we need computational algorithms for dealing with networks; for example, detecting characteristic patterns, network motifs or problems involving sub-graph mining and graph isomorphism. In this paper, we studied previous strategies for motif discovery in biological networks and then proposed a new strategy based on an optimization method and parallel computing. The proposed method is implemented on different networks and is compared with current strategies.

The method integrates two existing approaches, SCRAM and CK theory. SCRAM provides the framework for requirements management, while CK theory provides a framework for reasoning about design and its evolution. The method is demonstrated with the definition and refining of requirements for the BioVeL web toolkit. The objective of BioVeL is to allow scientists to understand, run, modify and construct workflows for data analysis with minimal training using a web-based interface. The proposed method is supported by prototyping activities for gathering user feedback, and refining requirements and design proposals. Using this method, the prototypes evolved from simple workflow execution enablers to include more complex functionalities for reviewing, modifying and building workflows in later versions. This paper presents a contribution to the application of techniques for requirements engineering. SCRAM–CK is an amalgamated method that combines a user-centred continuous refinement approach with support for design evolution through prototyping.

This paper aims to understand the current state of e-Infrastructure uptake in Africa and present some of these initiatives across the African continent by exploring the current landscape emerging from a survey of early consumers. These initiatives are discussed in terms of key projects and user communities that they are addressing. In line with wider perceptions that e-Infrastructures will re-shape the ways research is performed, this study yielded 34 current or planned e-Infrastructure projects across 13 African countries addressing a range of research domains, and identified 7 user communities across these disciplines. Our findings suggest that the African research community is increasingly interested and involved in e-Infrastructure development activities in response to the issue of limited access to dedicated global research and education resources. The study can contribute to the ongoing discussion on how e-Infrastructures can positively promote the research, technological development and innovation potential of developing countries. © 2015, Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.

The data transfer across data centres leads to bandwidth cost and time delay. It is more important to solve the data placement problem for these applications. The existing data placement approaches can only reduce the data transfer frequency, but not improve overall performance. In this paper, we propose a data placement strategy based on large neighbourhood search (LNS). The strategy has initial strategy generation stage and relaxation and re-insertion stage.

Although organized under the auspices of the e-Science Institute, the participants came from a variety of disciplines and brought a range interests. The workshops themselves were run as experiments in running smart meetings with the intentions of exchanging and recording knowledge and decisions discussed in the meeting. A recurring theme in the workshops was not only that technology can be provided in a smart space to help in the knowledge transfer and recording process, but also that the technology will only be adopted and exploited if the users of the smart space can easily use it. There are other human factors that affect the success of collaboration in a smart space. These include the willingness for participates to collaborate if they have concerns over privacy and anonymity, particularly when discussions and decisions are recorded using technology. The dynamics of how participants work together in groups to transfer knowledge can also be enhanced through the use of smart spaces. The fact that the workshops were run in different physical environments also provided insights into how the physical design of the meeting space might have on effective collaboration and therefore effective transmission of knowledge.

Within the past few years, it has also become feasible for uniprocessor hard real-time systems. However, garbage collection for multi-processors does not yet meet the requirements of hard real-time systems. In this paper, we present a hard real-time garbage collector for a Java chip multi-processor that provides non-disruptive and analyzable behavior. For retrieving the references in local variables of threads, we propose a protocol that minimizes disruptions for high-priority tasks while still providing good bounds on the time until stack scanning finishes. Also, we developed a hardware unit that enables transparent, preemptible copying of objects, which eliminates the need to block tasks while copying objects. Evaluation of the hardware shows that the copy unit introduces only little overhead and does not limit the critical path. Analyses for different aspects of the system are presented, which indicate that comprehensive analysis of the presented system is indeed possible. Measurements resulted in release jitter for high-priority tasks of 362 μs or less on an embedded multi-processor with eight cores clocked at 100 MHz. This indicates that with the proposed garbage collector, high scheduling quality and garbage collection do not contradict each other on chip multi-processors.

As the number of records grows, so does the difficulty to manage them, presenting challenges to save, retrieve, share, and manage sounds. These challenges are complicated by the fact that animal sound recordings have specific peculiarities, associated to the context in which the sound was recorded. For example, sounds emitted by individuals that are in groups may be different from ones emitted by isolated individuals. Although these characteristics may be relevant to biologists, they are seldom explicit in the recording metadata. This paper discusses our ongoing research on the management of sound recordings, considering factors such as environmental or social contexts, which are not treated by current systems. This work exploits retrieval based on context analysis. Query parameters include context variables that are dynamically derived using public services and ontologies associated with sound recording metadata.

Currently, these bases are being used to improve diagnosis, research and teaching, but in many cases, the infrastructure required has a prohibitive cost for many medical centres. However, resources can be attached from existing e-Science infrastructures. Therefore, many efforts have been made to establish best practices that allow the use of such infrastructures. However, e-Science relies on open, distributed, collaborative environments, built on top of very specialized technologies, such as Grid and Cloud computing, which require reasonable technical skills for their usage. Therefore, science gateways have become essential tools that assist users in interacting with e-Science applications. This paper describes TRENCADIS, a technology that supports the creation and operation of virtual knowledge bases. To this end, it provides developers with components and APIs for building secure data services that can be annotated and queried through ontology templates, based on DICOM and DICOM-SR. This technology was used in this paper to build a gateway for assisting diagnosis and research in breast cancer. We also present here the results of a study conducted to evaluate the gateway, from the point of view of the usability perceived by a group of physicians and radiologists. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","DICOM; DICOM-SR; Knowledge base; Usability","Biomedical applications; Breast Cancer; Collaborative environments; DICOM; DICOM-SR; e-Science; Grid and cloud computing; Knowledge base; Knowledge basis; Medical images; Medical knowledge; Science gateway; Secure data; Specialized technologies; Technical skills; Usability; Virtual knowledge; Distributed computer systems; Knowledge based systems; Medical applications; Diagnosis","Segrelles Quilis, J.

The study revealed the pressing and challenging big data management issues can broadly be classified as data governance, infrastructure management, and workflow management. The study identifies a gap in adopting effective workflow management system and coordinated outsourcing plan within the organisation. Although the study is limited by its sample size and generalisation, the findings are useful for other IT managers and practitioners of data-intensive organisations to examine their data management practices on the need to balance the demand for efficient scientific operations and sustainable business growth. This study recognised that although the organisation is implementing up-to-date and practical solutions to meet these challenges, effort is needed to harmonise and align these solutions with business growth strategies to sustain future growth.

Compute Clusters without energy intensive aircondition would run into thermal disaster within minutes. PCs participating in Desktop-Grids usually do not make use of any aircondition. In return and with raising energy prices, data centers have implemented lower costs air-conditioning means like e.g. free cooling, improving their thermodynamic-efficiency and PUE rating.

Objects, including research data and related information, are transferred and shared in electronic form easily in an e-Science environment. Provenance, as a complete record of the changes applied to an object, provides a basis to trust an object. At this point, this paper proposes the ""Provenance Security from Origin up to Now (PSecON)"" scheme to solve the problem of how to trust provenance which is used for object trust. Through PSecON, while tracing the real source of an object transferred between e-Science environments, researchers can ensure the integrity of the object and its provenance, and confirm its actual origin. PSecON satisfies transparent audits and audit availability as well as the confidentiality and privacy of data and its provenance. These are provided by the history pool as an open board and by information hashing, respectively. PSecON supports forgery prevention and detection for provenance as well via two-way certification. Moreover, PSecON is scalable and ensures efficient and fast tracking of provenance. Based on the detailed description of PSecON in the e-Science domain, this paper demonstrates the soundness of PSecON to ensure provenance security and its easy applicability to real-world systems by analyzing the time, space and transmission overhead. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

It is specially suited for high-throughput computing since the jobs evaluating the parameter space are loosely coupled or independent. A tool that integrates the modeling of a parameter study with the control of jobs in a distributed architecture is presented. The main task is to facilitate the creation and deletion of job templates, which are the elements describing the jobs to be run. Extra functionality relies upon the GridWay Metascheduler, acting as the middleware layer for job submission and control. It supports interesting features like multi-dimensional sweeping space, wildcarding of parameters, functional evaluation of ranges, value-skipping and job template automatic indexation. The use of this tool increases the reliability of the parameter sweep study thanks to the systematic bookkeeping of job templates and respective job statuses. Furthermore, it simplifies the porting of the target application to the grid reducing the required amount of time and effort. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The AMUC prototype harnesses graphic input via an electronic tablet as a query mechanism, time and position signals obtained from the sketch being mapped to the properties of data streams stored in the motion capture repository. As well as proposing a pragmatic solution for exploring motion capture datasets, the project demonstrates the conceptual value of iterative prototyping in innovative interdisciplinary design.

It was found that the pentad location and strength of the ITCZ had close relations with the typhoon frequency. Higher latitude location or strengthened ITCZ were found to be favorable for the occurrence of typhoons over the Northwestern Pacific. An index was defined for ascertaining the location of the ITCZ. It was found that the index defined with the maximum value of pentad and monthly meridional shear of zonal wind speed could better describe the location of ITCZ than another index defined with the maximum value of convergence. Correlation analysis between the index of ITCZ and the maximum cloud cover in the tropics showed that there were close relations between the ITCZ determined by the index and the maximum tropical cloud belt. The strength index of an ITCZ was defined as the zonal wind speed difference at latitudes south and north of the ITCZ. It was found that there are close relations between the ITCZ intensity and typhoon occurrence in the South China Sea [10°N-20°N, 100°E-120°E] and regions east of the Philippines and near the Mariana Islands [5°N-20°N, 127.5°E-150°E]. © Science Press, Ocean University of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH 2008.","ITCZ; Location index of the ITCZ; Strength index of the ITCZ; Typhoon over northwestern Pacific",,"Sun, J.; Physical Oceanography Laboratory, , Qingdao 266100, China; email: sunjilin@ouc.edu.cn",,,16725182,,,,"English","J.

Monitoring of Grid scientific workflows is essential not only for performance analysis but also to collect provenance data and gather feedback useful in future decisions, e.g., related to optimization of resource usage. In this paper, basic problems related to monitoring of Grid scientific workflows are discussed. Being highly distributed, loosely coupled in space and time, heterogeneous, and heavily using legacy codes, workflows are exceptionally challenging from the monitoring point of view. We propose a Grid monitoring architecture for scientific workflows. Monitoring data correlation problem is described and an algorithm for on-line distributed collection of monitoring data is proposed. We demonstrate a prototype implementation of the proposed workflow monitoring architecture, the GEMINI monitoring system, and its use for monitoring of a real-life scientific workflow. © 2008 - IOS Press and the authors.

Its super-scheduler is based on the proposed OGSA-EMS Architecture, in that it becomes the first working implementation that implements the documented component relationships within the OGSA-EMS architecture document v.1.0. Through the efforts and experience in the design and implementation, it has been confirmed that the documented OGSA-EMS architecture is quite feasible, but will require significant amount of refinement and speed improvements to finalize its detailed specifications. The super-scheduler also supports co-allocation across multiple sites to support automated execution of grid-based MPIs that execute across machines. Such a resource allocation requires sophisticated interactions between the OGSA-EMS components not covered in the current OGSA-EMS architecture, some of which are non-trivial.

Traditionally, software systems for music composition have been single user systems. As accessibility to the Internet has increased, some systems have been adapted so that musicians can produce collaborative work. However, many such systems are still based around the composition methods of the original single user systems. Various service oriented architectures are emerging based on WebServices or GridServices and other Internet technologies for dynamically building systems out of distributed components. Many e-Science projects are using these architectures to build collaborative environments. The software described in this paper takes such concepts and tools from service oriented architectures and e-Science, and applies them to develop software specifically for collaborative electro-acoustic composition on the Internet, allowing compositional tools and components to be published, discovered and used within a distributed environment. An objective is to explore and determine methods of composition appropriate for this environment. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2006.",,"Collaborative electro-acoustic compositions; Composition methods; Software systems; WebServices; Acoustic waves; Acoustoelectric effects; Computer software; Computer supported cooperative work; Distributed computer systems; World Wide Web; Online systems","Gibson, I.; School of Technology, , Leeds, United Kingdom; email: i.gibson@leedsmet.ac.uk",,,02683768,,IJATE,,"English","Int J Adv Manuf Technol",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750002036

However, publishers are not text mining specialists, nor typically are the end-user scientists who consume their products. This situation suggests a web services based solution, where text mining specialists process the literature obtained from publishers and make their results available to remote consumers (research scientists). In this paper we discuss the integration of web services and text mining within the domain of scientific publishing and explore the strengths and weaknesses of three generic architectural designs for delivering text mining web services. We argue for the superiority of one of these and demonstrate its viability by reference to an application designed to provide access to the results of text mining over the PubMed database of scientific abstracts.

It automatically senses and collects useful information from the nature, transforms raw information into resources in the environment, and organizes resources in semantic rich normal forms that can be easily understood by both machine and human. Geographically dispersed people and resources can work in cooperation to accomplish tasks and solve problems by actively participating material flows, energy flows, technology flows, information flows, knowledge flows and service flows in the environment through roles and machines, improving the environment and the nature. Parameters, characteristics and principles of the environment are proposed from the system methodology point of view.

However, currently great effort is being put into reducing the number of in-flight engine shutdowns, aborted take-offs and flight delays through the use of advanced engine health monitoring technology. This represents a benefit to society through reduced delays, reduced anxiety and reduced cost of ownership of aircraft. This is reflected in a change of emphasis within companies such as Rolls-Royce Plc where instead of selling engines to customers there is a fundamental shift to adoption of power-by-the-hour contracts. In these airlines make fixed regular payments based on the hours flown and the engine manufacturer retains responsibility for maintaining the engine. To support this new approach, improvements in in-flight monitoring of engines are being introduced with the collection of much more detailed data on the operation of the engine. At the same time advances have been made in Internet technologies providing a worldwide network of computers that can be used to access and process that data. The explosion of available knowledge within those large datasets also presents its own problems and here it is necessary to work on advanced decision support systems to identify the useful information in the data and provide knowledge-based advice between individual aircraft, airline repair and overhaul bases, world-wide data warehouses and the engine manufacturer. This paper presents a practical framework in which to build such a system that is inherent in the emerging Grid computing paradigm that provides the necessary computing resources.

It is nowadays considered a fundamental skill for students and citizens, that has the potential to affect future generations. At the roots of computational-thinking abilities stands the knowledge of computer programming, i.e. coding. With the goal of fostering computational thinking in young students, we address the challenging and open problem of using methods, tools and techniques to support teaching and learning of computer-programming skills in school curricula of the secondary grade and university courses. This problem is made complex by several factors. In fact, coding requires abstraction capabilities and complex cognitive skills such as procedural and conditional reasoning, planning, and analogical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new paradigm called ACME (“Code Animation by Evolved Metaphors”) that stands at the foundation of the Diogene-CT code visualization environment and methodology. We develop consistent visual metaphors for both procedural and object-oriented programming. Based on the metaphors, we introduce a playground architecture to support teaching and learning of the principles of coding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scalable code visualization tool using consistent metaphors in the field of the Computing Education Research (CER). It might be considered as a new kind of tools named as code visualization environments. © 2021, The Author(s).","Coding tools and techniques; Computers and education; Educational support; Learning environments",,"Veltri, E.; Università degli studi della BasilicataItaly; email: enzo.veltri@unibas.it",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",23659440,,,,"English","Int. j. educ. technol. high. educ.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102044596

Occasionally, after such interviews, children are confronted with misinformation regarding their experiences. The question that arises is whether their earlier interviews may protect them from reporting misinformation. The goal of the present experiment was to assess whether empirically based interviewing by means of the National Institute for Child Health and Development (NICHD) Protocol would affect the reporting of misinformation in children. Children were involved in an interactive event (i.e., science demonstration). Following this, three experimental groups were created: one group was interviewed using the NICHD Protocol, one group had to freely recall what they experienced, and one group was not asked to retrieve any memories about the event. Next, all children received misinformation concerning the event and were then subjected to a final memory test. We found that children’s recall during the NICHD interview protected children against the incorporation of misinformation in their accounts of the event. This effect was absent in the other two conditions. The current experiment suggests that evidence-based investigative interviewing can inoculate children’s memory against the corrupting impact of misinformation. © 2020, The Author(s).","Investigative interviewing; Misinformation; NICHD protocol; Retrieval-enhanced suggestibility",,"Otgaar, H.; Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Netherlands; email: Henry.Otgaar@maastrichtuniversity.nl",,"Springer",08820783,,,,"English","J.

One common feature of girls’ developmental years is the experience of gender discrimination, yet relatively few studies have examined how girls’ own experiences with gender discrimination may shape their connectedness to school and STEM. Using data from a cross-sectional study of ethnically and socioeconomically diverse adolescent girls (N = 295; Mage = 15.1, SD = 1.1; 54% White, 21% African American, 13% Latinx), we examined the unique and interactive effects of girls’ subjective experiences with gender discrimination and implicit gender-science stereotypes on school connectedness and STEM orientation. Participants completed a survey on their experiences with gender discrimination, school connectedness, math and science achievement motivations, and the gender-science implicit association test. Results demonstrated that girls who experienced more gender discrimination reported lower levels of school connectedness. Gender discrimination also negatively predicted math achievement motivations for girls who more strongly endorsed implicit gender-science stereotypes (i.e., science associated with men and liberal arts associated with women).

The purpose of these investments has been to advance scientific progress in the supported scientific disciplines such as biodiversity and ecological research. However, there is scare research on how these CI investments impact scientific progress. We conducted a longitudinal case study of CI development and scientific progress based on the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program in the United States. We contribute to filling in the research gap by finding CI investments result in impacts both internal and external to the particular discipline of biodiversity. We also find a feedback effect from the discipline to CI development, such that the science and its supporting CI coevolve. The coevolution of CI development and the scientific discipline hinges on the “linking-pin” of data infrastructure. The large-scale data sharing within the discipline and across disciplines, in turn, is contingent on CI governance and how data are structured. The identification of the synergistic coevolution of CI and science enriches coevolutionary theories as well as CI development research. Accordingly, further research and policy changes relating to why and how to fund CI development for sciences, are necessary. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coevolution; Cyberinfrastructure; Data sharing; Longitudinal case study; Scientific discipline","Biodiversity; Data Sharing; Ecology; Cyber infrastructures; Data infrastructure; Feedback effects; Large scale data; Long-term ecological research; Longitudinal case study; Scientific discipline; Scientific progress; Investments","Yu, Y.; School of Information, 59 Zhongguancun Street, Haidian, China; email: yanyu@ruc.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",01664972,,TNVTD,,"English","Technovation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090483672

For example, the conversion of academic scientific knowledge into technologies that can be owned and sold (i.e., science commercialization) is a growing global trend and key stakeholders have different ethical responses to this contested commodity. Commercialization of science can be viewed as a good thing because people believe it bolsters economic growth and broadly benefits society. Others view it as bad because they believe it discourages basic research that ought to be freely shared without concern for profit. Taking a descriptive sociological approach, we posit that the stance of a religious tradition toward capitalism will help shape individual scientists’ views on science commercialization and test whether the religious tradition of scientists correlates with their attitude toward the commercialization of science. To maximize variance on the religious tradition dimension, we analyze pooled data from a cross-national survey of university biologists and physicists encompassing France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Taiwan, Turkey, UK and the USA. We indeed find religious tradition differences. Hindus and scientists with no religious tradition are more likely to agree that commercialization of science “harms a university’s commitment to knowledge production” than Protestants. We end with a discussion on business ethics and the moral limits of the market as well as implications for entrepreneurs of contested commodities. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Academic capitalism; Contested commodity; Religion",,"Peifer, J.L.; Loomba Department of Management, One Bernard Baruch Way, United States; email: jpeifer@baruch.cuny.edu",,"Springer Netherlands",01674544,,,,"English","J.

However, comparative studies have focused more on cognitive skills and less on non-cognitive skills as plausible factors for the continual success. Thus, this study aimed to examine the non-cognitive factors related to students' science achievement in TIMSS. This study adopted secondary data analysis where the analysis was carried out on TIMSS 2015 data for respondents from Malaysia and Japan. This study proposed two models for each country which contained five constructs, namely four independent variables which are science teaching practices, victims of bullying, attitude towards science, school climate, and one independent variable i.e. science achievement. From the structural model of multiple group comparison analysis, almost all non-cognitive factors in the model showed significant difference between the two countries except for the relationship between attitude towards science and science achievement in TIMSS. © 2019 Eurasian Society of Educational Research.","Attitude towards science; School climate; Science achievement; Science teaching practices; Victims of bullying",,"Mohtar, L.E.; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Malaysia; email: lilelny@gmail.com",,"Modestum LTD",13058215,,,,"English","Eurasia J.

However, computational support for large-scale scientific experiments is still incipient and is considered one of e-science's greatest challenges. In this vein, providing provenance information to a scientist is part of these challenges. Provenance information helps to assure the reliability and reproducibility of experiments. Therefore, this work has as its main objective to present a new ontology—Open Provenance Model Ontology-e (OPMO-e)—which is part of an architecture, named SciProvMiner. Open Provenance Model Ontology-e is a new ontology that encompasses both prospective and retrospective provenance. SciProvMiner captures the provenance and implements all inference and completeness rules defined by Open Provenance Model to provide provenance information beyond those already established. We hypothesize that the capture and management of provenance data will provide scientists with implicit strategical information about the experiment through OPMO-e. Case studies were carried out to evaluate OPMO-e use considering SciProvMiner. The obtained results revealed that the use of the proposed ontology and SciProvMiner can enhance scientist's knowledge about an experiment.

Transatlantic experiences were compared and contrasted. Including strong participation from both Europe and the USA with high quality responses from experienced practitioners, the consultation was undertaken as part of a joint initiative and took the form of an online questionnaire supported by a set of stakeholder interviews and other discussions. Topics included were functions and features such as provision of numerical models and data, usability, and ease of access; show-stopping issues such as flexibility, reliability and longevity; centralised and distributed structures, and funding models. The results demonstrated a broadly similar set of experiences and implied a future as an evolution of that which exists today.

There are however domains where running services all the time is not suitable, for example when applying simulation workflows in the eScience domain. The simulation services orchestrated by these workflows are typically used only rarely and irregularly, keeping them running all the time would result in a significant waste of resources.

We will present the motivation and main idea of our solution approach and will also provide details about some of the results of our work.

The overwhelming volume of remote sensing imagery requires automated methods or systems for feature discovery. Existing research focuses on automatic extraction of isolated or elementary features, such as buildings and roads. It is rather understudied to discover complex geospatial features, which is spatially composed of elementary features. From the e-Science perspective, service computing technologies have shown great promise for widespread automation of data analysis and computation. The discovery of complex features would benefit from service computing technologies by computing spatial relations and their fuzziness among elementary features using geoprocessing services. The discovery process can be automated using an ontology approach. The paper presents how ontologies for complex geospatial features, enriched with fuzzy sets of spatial relations, can automate the workflow generation. Spatial computation functions, fuzzy membership functions, and mathematical fuzzy logical operators, are provided as services, and plugged into workflows on demand to enjoy the benefits of service computing technologies. A prototype system demonstrates on-demand uncertainty-aware detection of complex geospatial features in a geoprocessing service environment. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Complex geospatial feature; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy spatial relation ontology; Geoprocessing workflow; Geospatial service; Remote sensing imagery",,"He, L.; Department of Mathematics, China",,"Springer Verlag",18650473,,,,"English","Earth Sci.

This provides a well-defined interface layer that abstracts from both underlying PID systems and higher-level applications. Our practical implementation is based on the Handle System, yet the fundamental concept of PID-based ADTs is transferable to other infrastructures, and it is well suited to achieve interoperability between them.","Data-intensive science; E-Science infrastructures; Persistent identifiers; Scientific data management; Unique identifiers","Abstracting; Information management; Interoperability; Data intensive science; E-science infrastructures; Persistent identifiers; Scientific data management; Unique identifiers; Abstract data types",,,"Ubiquity Press Ltd",16831470,,,,"English","Data Sci.

Access control for such systems is defined as the ability to authorise or repudiate access to resources by a particular user. Traditional access control solutions are inherently inadequate for collaborative systems because they are effective only in situations where the system knows in advance which users are going to access the resources and what are their access rights so that they can be predefined by the developers or security administrators, but in collaborative systems the number of users as well as their usage on resources is not static. Targeting collaborative systems, a fine grained, flexible, persistent trust-based model for protecting the access and usage of digital resources is defined in this paper using radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). RBFNN classifies the users requesting the resources as trustworthy and non-trustworthy based on their attributes. RBFNN is used for classification because of its ability to generalise well for even unseen data and non-iterative method employed in its training. A proof of concept implementation backed by extensive set of tests on the real data collected for one such collaborative systems, i.e. Enabling Grids for E-Science grid demonstrated that the design is sound for collaborative systems where access of resources are provided to large and unknown users with their variant set of requirements. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","access control; classification; collaborative systems; Radial Basis Function Neural Network; trust","Access to resources; Collaborative environments; Collaborative systems; Non-iterative method; Radial basis function neural networks; Security administrator; trust; Trust-based access control; Classification (of information); Access control","Gupta, B.; Department of Computer Science, , Delhi, 110007, India; email: pbedi@cs.du.ac.in",,,0952813X,,,,"English","J.

Past research on upstream transmission in passive optical networks (PONs) has mainly considered packet-switched traffic and has focused on optimizing packet-level performance metrics, such as reducing mean delay. This study proposes and evaluates a dynamic circuit and packet PON (DyCaPPON) that provides dynamic circuits along with packet-switched service. DyCaPPON provides (i) flexible packet-switched service through dynamic bandwidth allocation in periodic polling cycles, and (ii) consistent circuit service by allocating each active circuit a fixed-duration upstream transmission window during each fixed-duration polling cycle. We analyze circuit-level performance metrics, including the blocking probability of dynamic circuit requests in DyCaPPON through a stochastic knapsack-based analysis. Through this analysis we also determine the bandwidth occupied by admitted circuits. The remaining bandwidth is available for packet traffic and we conduct an approximate analysis of the resulting mean delay of packet traffic. Through extensive numerical evaluations and verifying simulations we demonstrate the circuit blocking and packet delay trade-offs in DyCaPPON. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic circuit switching; Ethernet passive optical network; Grant scheduling; Grant sizing; Packet delay; Stochastic knapsack","Bandwidth; Flexible electronics; Frequency allocation; Packet networks; Passive optical networks; Stochastic systems; Dynamic Circuits; Ethernet passive optical networks; Grant scheduling; Grant sizings; Packet delay; Stochastic knapsack; Electric network analysis","Reisslein, M.; School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287-5706, United States; email: reisslein@asu.edu",,"Elsevier",15734277,,,,"English","Opt.

The rate of growth of scientific data makes eScience workflows data-intensive, challenging existing workflow solutions. Efficient methods of handling large data in scientific workflows based on web services are needed. The purpse of this paper is to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach - In a previous paper the authors proposed Data-Flow Delegation (DFD) as a means to optimize orchestrated workflow performance, focusing on SOAP web services. To improve the performance further, they propose pipelined data-flow delegation (PDFD) for web service-based eScience workflows in this paper, by leveraging from the domain of parallel programming. Briefly, PDFD allows partitioning of large datasets into independent subsets that can be communicated in a pipelined manner. Findings - The results show that the PDFD improves the execution time of the workflow considerably and is capable of handling much larger data than the non-pipelined approach. Practical implications - Execution of a web service-based workflow hampered by the size of data can be facilitated or improved by using services supporting Pipelined Data-Flow Delegation. Originality/value - Contributions of this work include the proposed concept of combining pipelining and Data-Flow Delegation, an XML Schema supporting the PDFD communication between services, and the practical evaluation of the PDFD approach.

Especially with respect to increasing costs of operating data centers, the intelligent yet automated and secure sharing of resources is a key factor for success. With the D-Grid Scheduler Interoperability (DGSI) project within the German D-Grid Initiative, we provide a strategic technology for the automatically negotiated, SLA-secured, dynamically provisioned federation of resources and services for Grid-and Cloud-type infrastructures. This goal is achieved by complementing current DCI schedulers with the ability to federate infrastructure for the temporary leasing of resources and rechanneling of workloads. In this work, we describe the overall architecture and SLA-secured negotiation protocols within DGSI and depict an advanced mechanism for resource delegation through means of dynamically provisioned, virtualized middleware. Through this methodology, we provide the technological foundation for intelligent capacity planning and workload management in a cross-infrastructure fashion. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cloud computing; Grid computing; Middleware; Negotiation; Resource management; SLAs; Virtualization","Capacity planning; Cross-community; Dynamic elasticity; e-Science; Grid environments; Key factors; Negotiation; Negotiation protocol; Operating data; Quasi-static; Resource management; SLAs; Technical levels; Virtualizations; Workload management; Cloud computing; Elasticity; Interoperability; Middleware; Network architecture; Planning; Scheduling; Grid computing","Papaspyrou, A.; Technische Universität Dortmund, Dortmund, Germany; email: alexander.papaspyrou@tu-dortmund.de",,,15707873,,,,"English","J.

When digital research is studied, the emphasis has been on the diffusion of technological innovations, rather than the social and political dynamics shaping the design and role of technologies in research. However, what researchers know, and with whom they collaborate, could be transformed through the strategic use of advances designed to support research, defined here as research-centred computational networks. This article presents a framework for conceptualizing the social and technological choices shaping the next generation of research in ways that could open - democratize - key aspects of the research process that move well beyond academic publication. The framework highlights the limited scope of innovation to date, and identifies a variety of factors that maintain and enhance institutional control over the research process, at the risk of losing the creative and productive bottom-up participation by networked researchers and citizen researchers among the public at large.

This model is then employed to automate the generation of the trial management systems used in collaborative cancer clinicaltrials. The integration of the Web services standards with the standard domain metamodel enables the generated systems to support syntactic, semantic and computational interoperability that is essential for collaborative e-Science application. Automating the model-driven system generation not only speeds up its development, but also enforces its conformance to these standards.

The state of atmospheric sensible variables at the time of the image is a key driver of atmospheric path radiance and transmissivity effects. A thorough assessment of the state of the atmosphere is rarely conducted in HSI analysis, however, even in rigorous scientific literature. This is due in part to the historical lack of meteorological data associated with imagery collects, and the difficulty in accessing and analyzing the data that is available. With the expanding availability of online climatological and observational atmospheric data and the advent of web enabled search and retrieval tools, easy access to worldwide atmospheric data relevant to atmospheric compensation is possible. In this project, a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is developed that automatically retrieves relevant atmospheric data from several online data stores based on input image metadata. The RBDMS provides researchers with a single, easily accessible repository of meteorological data to aid in researching atmospheric effects.

More in general, in the e-science environment, it is considered as a critical and urgent requirement to integrate services across distributed, heterogeneous, dynamic ""virtual organizations"" formed by different resources within a single enterprise. In the last decade, Astronomy has become an immensely data-rich field due to the evolution of detectors (plates to digital to mosaics), telescopes and space instruments. The Virtual Observatory approach consists of the federation under common standards of all astronomical archives available worldwide, as well as data analysis, data mining and data exploration applications. The main drive behind such an effort is that once the infrastructure is complete, it will allow a new type of multi-wavelength, multi-epoch science, which can only be barely imagined. Data mining, or knowledge discovery in databases, while being the main methodology to extract the scientific information contained in such Massive Data Sets (MDS), poses crucial problems since it has to orchestrate complex problems posed by transparent access to different computing environments, scalability of algorithms, reusability of resources, etc. In the present paper we summarize the present status of the MDS in the Virtual Observatory and what is currently done and planned to bring advanced data mining methodologies in the case of the DAME (DAta Mining and Exploration) project. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper examines various techniques for generating geo-referenced metadata, including converting placenames to coordinates and using entity extraction to discover places in unstructured text, such as abstracts. It describes several prototype services developed, which deliver geo-referenced data in different ways - as search results overlaid onto a map, as location specific data delivered to location aware mobile devices just in time, and as raw structured metadata supplied by web services, which could be combined with other data sets in support of e-science. Findings: Although library metadata standards can accommodate location, catalogers rarely provide location information related to the content of the intellectual product. Entity extraction services can find location information in free text contents, such as abstracts, and even provide the appropriate coordinates for the identified places, thus enabling geo-referenced browsing and searching of metadata. Libraries should consider multiple strategies for delivering these data, to maximize its utility for end users. Just-in-time information retrieval is rarely used in library systems, but is an essential technique for mobile location-based information services. Originality/value: The paper describes several distinct ways in which location-based information services can be delivered to end users.

These rich resources do, however, bring with them substantial challenges associated with organizing and using data. These processes are often referred to as 'data management'. The Data Management through e-Social Science (DAMES) project is working to support activities of data management for social science research. This paper describes the DAMES infrastructure, focusing on the data-fusion process that is central to the project approach. It covers: the background and requirements for provision of resources by DAMES; the use of grid technologies to provide easy-to-use tools and user front-ends for several common social science data-management tasks such as data fusion; the approach taken to solve problems related to data resources and metadata relevant to social science applications; and the implementation of the architecture that has been designed to achieve this infrastructure.

Thus, ever-increasing amounts of data about genomic features are stored in public databases and can be readily visualized by genome browsers. To perform in silico experimentation conveniently with this genomics data, biologists need tools to process and compare datasets routinely and explore the obtained results interactively. The complexity of such experimentation requires these tools to be based on an e-Science approach, hence generic, modular, and reusable. A virtual laboratory environment with workflows, workflow management systems, and Grid computation are therefore essential. Findings: Here we apply an e-Science approach to develop SigWin-detector, a workflow-based tool that can detect significantly enriched windows of (genomic) features in a (DNA) sequence in a fast and reproducible way. For proof-of-principle, we utilize a biological use case to detect regions of increased and decreased gene expression (RIDGEs and anti-RIDGEs) in human transcriptome maps. We improved the original method for RIDGE detection by replacing the costly step of estimation by random sampling with a faster analytical formula for computing the distribution of the null hypothesis being tested and by developing a new algorithm for computing moving medians. SigWin-detector was developed using the WS-VLAM workflow management system and consists of several reusable modules that are linked together in a basic workflow. The configuration of this basic workflow can be adapted to satisfy the requirements of the specific in silico experiment. Conclusion: As we show with the results from analyses in the biological use case on RIDGEs, SigWin-detector is an efficient and reusable Grid-based tool for discovering windows enriched for features of a particular type in any sequence of values. Thus, SigWin-detector provides the proof-of-principle for the modular e-Science based concept of integrative bioinformatics experimentation. © 2008 Inda et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,"Breit, T.

It explains and emphasises the relevance of LIS-based information services and expertise in e-Science activities. Design/methodology/approach - Projects were analysed to determine the extent to which institutions or persons with LIS expertise were involved and information services provided. Findings - Very few of the e-Science projects made use of LIS-based services. This omission could reduce the quality of e-Science-related research in the long term and LIS experts could lose their role and expertise in serving scientists. Further research is needed to verify this. Additionally research is needed to determine whether e-Science projects in other countries are also lacking LIS services. Research limitations/ implications - The research was undertaken during the preliminary phase of the projects. Practical implications - Funding should emphasise the inclusion and provision of LIS services. Originality/value - The findings show a lack of LIS services in e-Science projects, which could otherwise enhance the projects' development and the distribution of their results. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Communication technologies; Digital libraries; European Union; Germany; Information science; Information services","Digital libraries; Grid computing; Information retrieval; Information science; Information services; Information theory; Libraries; Communication technologies; E sciences; European Union; Germany; Arctic engineering","Osswald, A.; Institute of Information Science, , Cologne, Germany; email: achim.osswald@fh-koeln.de",,,14684527,,OIRNA,,"English","Online Info.

Here, we explore this question with a special focus on both core, to a large extent biologically rooted (e.g., personality, intelligence), and surface, more malleable and socio-culturally conditioned (e.g., creative self-concept), predictors of real-life creativity. Using a series of multivariate structural equation models (N = 803), we examined how creative self-concept, lower-level personality aspects, and cognitive ability (divergent thinking and intelligence) relate to creative activities and achievements across domains. Creative activity in certain domains (i.e., science or art) fully mediated the links between creative self-concept, intelligence, divergent thinking, personality, and creative achievement. No cross-domain effects were observed; while creative activity in art predicted achievement in art, it did not predict science accomplishment. Similarly, the activity in science predicted achievement in science, but not in the arts. The structure of the most relevant predictors of creative activity across domains differed. Creative activity in science was mainly predicted by intelligence, divergent thinking and the Intellect aspect of the Openness to Experience trait. Creative activity in art was predicted by the Openness aspect of the Openness to Experience personality trait and creative self-concept. For everyday creative activity, intelligence, personality, and creative self-concept played a more balanced and similar role.

Most importantly, inter-core crosstalk (XT) and resource fairness need to be considered to satisfy high-quality transmission and to avoid unnecessary resource occupation of formerly arriving AR requests. We propose a dynamic HTA-RSCA algorithm that combines time recycling and reuse mechanisms in the time domain with routing, spectrum and core assignment (RSCA) in the spatial-spectrum domain. Specially, pretreatment techniques include super-channel (Sp-Ch) order pre-definition and time-spectrum partition. These appropriate operations are ready for efficient resource searching and requests assignment. Taking transmission quality into consideration, XT-avoid principle is involved in Sp-Ch order pre-definition and dynamic time domain mechanisms to realize the fair and flexible provisioning. XT-awareness is included in the final allocation step to rank available resources options. Simulation results confirm that the dynamic HTA-RSCA can reduce network blocking probability (BP) than comparison algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt applying time mechanisms to address dynamic provisioning of hybrid IR and AR requests in SDM-EONs. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Advance reservation (AR); Elastic optical networks; Immediate request (IR); Inter-core crosstalk (XT); Routing spectrum and core assignment (RSCA); Super-channel","Blocking probability; IPTV; Space division multiple access; Time domain analysis; Dynamic provisioning; Dynamic service provisioning; Network blocking; Pretreatment technique; Resource searching; Reuse mechanism; Spatial spectra; Transmission quality; Dynamics","Huang, S.; State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications, China; email: shghuang@bupt.edu.cn",,"Academic Press Inc.",10685200,,OFTEF,,"English","Opt.

Using population data from administrative registers in Sweden, the findings show that younger siblings, net of parental characteristics, are more likely to choose a STEM field if their older sibling has attended or is already attending a STEM program. Moreover, a gender difference is clear concerning the choice of a STEM field among younger siblings: Girls are more likely to choose a STEM field if they have an older sister who has attended a STEM program, than if they have an older brother in a similar program. However, the corresponding results are not found for boys.

STEM learning was hypothesized to be more challenging for impulsive students, since it requires the practice and repetition of tasks as well as concerted attention to task performance. Impulsivity was assessed in a cross-sectional sample of 2,476 students in grades 6–12. Results show impulsivity affects a larger population of students, not limited to students with learning disabilities. Impulsivity was associated with lower sources of self-efficacy for science (SSSE), interest in most STEM domains (particularly math), and self-reported STEM skills. The large negative effect size observed for impulsivity was opposed by higher mindset, which describes a student’s belief in the importance of effort when learning is difficult. Mindset had a large positive effect size associated with greater SSSE, STEM interest, and STEM skills. When modeled together, results offer that mindset interventions may benefit impulsive students who struggle with STEM. Together, these data suggest important interconnected roles for impulsivity and mindset that can influence secondary students’ STEM trajectories. © 2019 Marriott et al.

All communication systems are composed of the same basic elements and all face comparable challenges. In this Commentary, we explore the extent to which research investigating how non-human animals communicate with each other (animal communication) overlaps in questions and approaches with research focused on how humans communicate with each other. We place a special focus on human communication involving scientific content, i.e. science communication. We begin with a brief review of the fields of animal communication and science communication. We next synthesize literature from each field to examine the roles, impacts and potential interactions of communication system elements – signaling environments, signalers, signal form and receivers – on effective communication. We find that research examining animal and human communication, including science communication, often has different emphases. Animal communication research, for example, tends to focus more on the role of the signaling environment through quantification of receiver responses. In contrast, science communication research currently emphasizes relationship building between signalers and receivers, and quantifies aspects of the receiver’s psychology. Informed by our cross-disciplinary assessment, we propose potentially productive avenues of future research in both animal communication and science communication. © 2018.

The spectrophotometric signal is affected not only by image movement and deformation due to wavefront error but also by electrical variation in the detector system. These time-variation components, coupled to the transit signal, distort the measurements of atmospheric composition in transit spectroscopy. Here we propose a new concept for improvement of spectrophotometric accuracy through the calibration of the time-variation components in the detector system by developing densified pupil spectroscopy that provides multiple spectra of the star-planet system. Owing to a group of pixels exposed by the object light (i.e., science pixels), pixel-to-pixel variations can be smoothed out through an averaging operation; thus, only common time-variation components over the science pixels remain. In addition, considering that the detector plane is optically conjugated to the pupil plane, a pupil mask can completely block astronomical light coming into residual pixels. The common time-variation components are reconstructed with the residual pixels and reduced into a random term. Applying the densified pupil spectrograph with a mid-infrared detector system to a large space cryogenic telescope such as the Origins Space Telescope, we show that the system nearly achieves photon noise-limited performance and detects absorption features through transmission spectroscopy and secondary eclipse of terrestrial planets orbiting M-type stars at 10 pc with 60 transit observations. Thus, the proposed method contributes to the measurement of planetary habitability and biosignatures of the nearby transiting habitable candidates. © 2018.

While large-scale research projects have developed sophisticated data distribution networks to share their data with researchers globally, there is no such support for the many millions of research projects generating data of interest to much smaller audiences (as exemplified by the long tail scientist). In data-oriented research, every aspect of the research process is influenced by data access. However, sharing and accessing data efficiently as well as lowering access barriers are difficult. In the absence of dedicated large-scale storage, many have noted that there is an enormous storage capacity available via connected peers, none more so than the storage resources of many research groups. With widespread usage of the content delivery network model for disseminating web content, we believe a similar model can be applied to distributing, sharing, and accessing long tail research data in an e-Science context. We describe the vision and architecture of a social content delivery network – a model that leverages the social networks of researchers to automatically share and replicate data on peers' resources based upon shared interests and trust. Using this model, we describe a simulator and investigate how aspects such as user activity, geographic distribution, trust, and replica selection algorithms affect data access and storage performance. From these results, we show that socially informed replication strategies are comparable with more general strategies in terms of availability and outperform them in terms of spatial efficiency.

However, some drawbacks, such as the lack of solid expertise in one specific discipline, have also been exposed. A simple and efficient way of implementing an interdisciplinary study is reported to be one that combines areas that are computable (i.e., science and engineering) and non-computable (i.e., emotions or abstractions often found in the arts and humanities). This approach has been verified in studies conducted in the last four years on mostly firstand second-year undergraduate students with different majors, with close to 1,000 participants, and has successfully shown to yield diverse mixing between different disciplines, with approximately 300 different outcomes. This particular approach to interdisciplinarity is easy and simple to implement, yields different interconnections among various disciplines, exhibits clear measures of success, and can be done along with expertise training in a traditional field. © 2017, E-FLOW PDF NeuroQuantology.

With the emergence of e-science workflows, which are used in different domains like astronomy, life science, and physics, to model and execute vast series of dependents functionalities and a large amount of manipulated data, the workflow management systems are required to provide customizable programming environments to ease the programming effort required by scientists to orchestrate a computational science experiment. A key issue for e-science WfMS is how to deal with the change of the execution environment constraints and the variability and confliction of end users and cloud providers objectives for the execution of the same workflow or sub-workflow. They have to customize their management processes to insure the adaptability of the execution environment to the scientific workflows specificities, especially when dealing with large-scale (data, computing, I/O)-intensive workflows. In this paper, we propose a dynamically re-configurable framework for the deployment of scientific workflows in the Cloud (called DR-SWDF) that allows customizing the workflow deployment process according to a set of objectives and constraints of end users or cloud providers defined differently for the tasks or partitions of the same workflow. The DR-SWDF framework offers a K-means based algorithm that allows dynamically clustering the input workflows or sub-workflows in order to identify the most convenient techniques or algorithms to be applied for their scheduling and deployment in the cloud. The simulations results run on three examples large-scale scientific workflows show that our proposed framework can achieve better results than the use of a generic purpose approach. © 2017 SCPE.","Cloud computing; Configuration; K-means; Partitioning; Provisioning; Scheduling; Scientific workflows; Workflow management system","Cloud computing; Clustering algorithms; Computer aided software engineering; Environmental management; Information management; Scheduling; Work simplification; Configuration; K-means; Partitioning; Provisioning; Scientific workflows; Workflow management systems; Distributed computer systems",,,"West University of Timisoara",18951767,,,,"English","Scalable Comput.

This article aims to examine how the interactions and perceptions of users from a defined domain, i.e. science education, vary across different groups of teachers while retrieving video. Given the prevalence of digital resources in use in education today, it is critical to assess users' perspectives and experiences for retrieving information across different contexts and individual user groups. Design/methodology/approach ? Interactive search experiments with 28 users were performed. A pre-experiment questionnaire collected the demographic information used to form groups for comparison in the present study. Users attempted six experimenter-developed topics using a prototype video retrieval system; experimental measures were recorded, including all actions, completion rates, errors and durations. Users rated their experiences and levels of satisfaction with different aspect of the system after each search topic. Data analyses included mean comparisons across the different groups. Findings ? A variety of influences emerged from the results, including significant variations among teachers' interactions, levels of satisfaction and expectations across different groups of users. Research limitations/implications ? Understanding the interactions and perceptions when retrieving digital video provides insights for information professionals on how to better support the needs of different users. If systems are not taking into account users and context, there can be a mismatch between the needs of users and interactive systems, which can lead to low perceptions and further underuse of digital resources. Originality/value ? Although similar influences on digital libraries have been analysed in other contexts, they have not been directly assessed, as they specifically pertain to experiences with and perceptions of video. © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Information retrieval; User interfaces; User studies","data analysis; error; expectation; experimental model; human; human experiment; information retrieval; library; perception; questionnaire; satisfaction; teacher; videorecording","Albertson, D.; University of AlabamaUnited States; email: dea@ua.edu",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02640473,,ELLID,,"English","Electron.

As successful projects come to an end, it is necessary to find (new) models to secure continuous exploitation of products generated by these projects. Taking this step requires business considerations that are not trivial to do from the role of a researcher. This paper presents our experiences in adopting a methodology from lean business development, the Business Model Canvas (BMC). This methodology enables structured reflection upon the business model and facilitates exploring alternative ones (pivoting). We have applied the BMC to one of the science gateways designed, developed, and operated by the Academic Medical Center (AMC) e-Science group: the AMC Computational Neuroscience Gateway. The current gateway BMC is explained in the paper and used as basis for a reflection to improve its sustainability. Alternative business models are given as examples of BMC iteration or pivots. This exercise helped us to structure the various aspects to be considered when designing or reflecting upon the business model of our gateway. It also facilitated the visualization of the complete business picture and helps the reflection about improvements in the business model toward sustainability. We believe that this methodology could be valuable also for the reflection about sustainability of other science gateways that are growing from academic groups that do not have business training. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Business Model Canvas (BMC); science gateway (SG); sustainability; virtual research environment (VRE)","Iterative methods; Neurology; Sustainable development; Academic medical centers; Business modeling; Business models; Business training; Infrastructure project; Lean business; Science gateway; Virtual research environment; Computational neuroscience","Shahand, S.; E-Science Group, Meibergdreef 9, Netherlands; email: s.shahand@amc.uva.nl",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",15320626,,CCPEB,,"English","Concurr.

Workflows help overcome barriers by hiding details of underlying computational infrastructure and are portable between various platforms including cloud; they are also increasingly accepted within e-science research communities. Issues arising from the range of workflow systems available and the complexity of workflow development have been addressed by focusing on workflow interoperability, and providing customised support for different science communities. However, the deployments of such environments can be challenging, even where user requirements are comparatively modest. RESWO (Reconfigurable Environment Service for Workflow Orchestration) is a virtual platform-as-aservice cloud model that allows leaner customised environments to be assembled and deployed within a cloud. Suitable distributed computation resources are not always easily affordable and can present a further barrier to engagement by scientists. Desktop grids that use the spare CPU cycles available within an organisation are an attractively inexpensive type of infrastructure for many, and have been effectively virtualised as a cloud-based resource. However, hosts in this environment are volatile: leading to the tail problem, where some tasks become randomly delayed, affecting overall performance. To solve this problem, new algorithms have been developed to implement a cloudbursting scheduler in which durable cloud-based CPU resources may execute replicas of jobs that have become delayed. This paper describes experiences in the development of a RESWO instance in which a desktop grid is buttressed with CPU resources in the cloud to support the aspirations of bioscience researchers. A core component of the architecture, the cloudbursting scheduler, implements an algorithm to perform late job detection, cloud resource management and job monitoring. The experimental results obtained demonstrate significant performance improvements and benefits illustrated by use cases in bioscience research.","Cloudbursting; Hybrid cloud; Workflow","Algorithms; Distributed computer systems; Research; Scheduling; Cloudbursting; Computational infrastructure; Computational resources; Distributed computations; Hybrid clouds; Reconfigurable environment; Research communities; Workflow; Interoperability","Winter, S.

Design/methodology/approach: The investigation used primary and secondary sources from the history of science and made the link to the actual debate on copyright, piracy and scientific communication. Findings: The paper describes how Elzevier, through non-authorized exploitation of a new product and without consideration of the editor's legitimate interests, in a context of missing copyright protection, largely contributed to the dissemination of the French Journal de Savants and its content, and finally to the success of scientific journals. Obviously, rights infringement can not only promote the interest and objective of the rights holder but also and above all contribute to the emergence and development of new forms of scientific life. Sometimes, when barriers to communication and debate are too strong, tolerated and calculated infringement may be an option to move the lines/change the situation. Research limitations/implications: In the post-Gutenberg galaxy, made up of open access, common goods and public domain, open data and e-Science, evaluation, innovation, sustainability, communication and sharing, copyright is not necessarily the (only) option to develop scientific communication. At least, the authors have to study lessons from academic publishing, copyright protection and piracy very carefully.

These data include simulation input and output files, intermediate results files, log and error files, associated metadata, and information capturing the processes that generate the data. The question of how to effectively store and manage data files within a Grid computing environment is increasingly becoming an important issue. This paper illustrates how we built a lightweight e-Science infrastructure for data management within a Grid computing environment, including the integration of data curation activities into the entire Grid-based simulation process. Rather than focusing on specific implementation details, we aim to identify the key issues and research challenges, describing how various existing technologies and tools can be best integrated to address these requirements and challenges. Although the case of quantum mechanical simulation of materials properties is used in the paper, much of the discussion is as generic as possible so that approaches, methods and practice (e.g. integrated approach, workflow taxonomy and development approach, simple but useful semantic annotation approach) can be applied to wider domains and disciplines to facilitat the digital research. A comparison between our approach and Cloud computing, and lessons learned in data management within the Grid computing environment, are also presented. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

However, modular reasoning about programs that use subtypes requires that each overriding method obeys the specifications of all methods that it overrides. For example, if method scale is specified in a supertype Vector2d to take at most 42 ns to execute, then an override of scale cannot take more than 42 ns to execute in any subtype, such as Vector3d. The problem is that subtype objects typically contain more information, such as the z coordinate in Vector3d, and thus their methods often require more time to execute than the methods they override. In this paper, we show how to specify timing constraints for subtypes in a way that both allows overriding subtype methods to have more time to execute and yet permits precise modular verification and checking of timing constraints. Our techniques allow object-oriented coding and design patterns based on subtype polymorphism to be used in real-time and safety-critical software.

The objective of this research is to investigate the factors which influence scientists' data sharing behaviors. Two theoretical perspectives, institutional theory and theory of planned behavior, are employed in developing a conceptual model, which shows the complementary nature of the institutional and individual factors influencing scientists' data sharing behaviors. Institutional theory can explain the context in which individual scientists are acting; whereas the theory of planned behavior can explain the underlying motivations behind scientists' data sharing behaviors in an institutional context. This research will use a survey method to investigate the data sharing factors at individual and institutional levels. The findings from this study have the potential to accelerate both scientific collaborations and further enable data-intensive scientific research. This research can provide useful guidelines for designing data sharing repositories, developing relevant policies for data sharing, and facilitating individual scientists' data sharing within different scientific communities.","Data science; Data sharing; E-Science; Scientists; STEM",,"Kim, Y.; School of Information Studies, , Syracuse, NY 13244, United States; email: ykim58@syr.edu",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc",15508390,,,,"English","Proc.

A working environment offering full support for using visualization as a research tool could take dialect geography into the era of e-Science. Despite the advent of electronic data processing, electronic publishing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), an analysis of the most important computerized tools for dialect geography research suggests that there is little support for the use of modern data mining and analysis techniques connected to visualization for the analysis and interpretation of dialect data. In this article, we use the electronic publication of two major dialect dictionaries to illustrate the value of visualization as a research tool by showing how visual data mining and combining dialect data with independent data sets applies to dialect geography research. We argue that there is no need for large-scale software development because visualization, as a research tool, is supported to a large extent by geo-browsers such as 'Google Earth', which make it possible to flexibly combine and visualize different types of geo-referenced data. © The Author 2010.

In silico oncology simulation models may be used for evaluating and comparing different therapeutic schemes, while at the same time considering different values of critical parameters which present substantial inter-patient variability. As the number of the involved parameters characterizing both the complex tumour biosystem and possible treatment schemes increases, the resulting exponential increase in computational requirements makes the use of a grid environment for the execution of the simulations a particularly attractive solution. In this paper, a grid-enabled simulation environment for the execution of in silico oncology radiotherapy simulations on grid infrastructures is presented and implementation details are discussed. The environment provides a web portal as the end-user interface and contains advanced features that facilitate the execution of in silico oncology simulations in grid environments. Special consideration has been given during the development of the environment in order to simplify the maintenance and extension of the application, while additional services for Quality of Service provisioning have been applied. The simulation environment has been employed in order to perform several scenarios of glioblastoma multiforme radiotherapy simulations on the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE (EGEE) grid infrastructure.

Scientific Grids handle large amounts of data and share resources, but the implementation of service-based applications that use scientific infrastructures remains a challenging task, due to the heterogeneity of Grid middleware and different programming models. This paper proposes an e-Science environment providing functionality in a simplified way, considering the Grid as a source of computational power and an information infrastructure. To promote integration among components and user interaction, the paper outlines a SOA-based scientific environment where an experiment is modeled through an abstract workflow defining the functional model of the experiment. The tasks are mapped to the corresponding scientific services by a workflow engine, separating logical aspects from implementation issues. Services depend on the type of experiment and can be re-used, wrapped, or moved into a new workflow. Infrastructural services discover suitable resources that match user requirements and schedule workflow tasks. Further, they monitor the execution of each task and aggregate the results. The proposed approach provides a simple-to-use and standardized way for the deployment of scientific workflows in a distributed scientific environment, including the Grid. © 2011, IGI Global.","E-Science; Grid; Service Oriented Architectures; Web Services; Workflows","Computer programming; Experiments; Information services; Middleware; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Abstract workflow; Computational power; e-Science; Functional model; Grid; GRID middleware; Information infrastructures; Large amounts of data; Programming models; Scientific grids; Scientific infrastructure; Scientific service; Scientific workflows; Service-based; User interaction; User requirements; Work-flows; Workflow engines; Web services","Bosin, A.; Università degli Studi di CagliariItaly",,"IGI Global",19380194,,,,"English","Int.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper provides an example of the deployment of UCLP in the GÉANT2/National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) scenario, and compares how network operators, advanced users and regular end users would do their work, with and without UCLP. Findings - The paper provides high-level technical information about UCLP as well as depicting the drivers for its use in the European research networking community. Research limitations/implications - This paper does not explain the details of the deployment of the software in the GÉANT2/National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) scenario, it just explains the benefits that the deployment of the software would provide. If the deployment was to be done today, some improvements to UCLP should be done, as well as support for more equipment vendors should be added. Practical implications - UCLP could provide more flexibility to the e-science community if it was deployed over the European research networking infrastructure, because it would isolate network users from each other while providing them an unprecedented degree of control over the network. Originality/value - Nowadays, several control/management solutions for networks exist, but none that is capable of partitioning a physical network into slices and handoff its management to the users, like UCLP does. This is the first UCLP paper that studies a hypothetical deployment of UCLP in the European research networking scenario, and evaluates the drivers and implications of such a deployment.","Bandwidths; Computer networks; Computer software; Configuration management; Graphical user interfaces",,"Grasa, E.; Technical University of Catalonia, , Barcelona, Spain; email: eduard.grasa@tsc.upc.edu",,,10662243,,,,"English","Internet Res.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348998056

This report persuaded the Department of Health that a radical solution was needed to improve the standard recording of routine clinical care. One of the obvious rewards emanating from this improved standard would be the ability to learn new clinical knowledge from an analysis of the data collected. The UK government has made a huge investment in developing IT within the National Health Service, with the Medical Research Council also investing in a research programme in e-health and e-science. Electronic medical records hold promise for large-scale pharmacogenetic studies of drug effectiveness and safety for important diseases, including cancer. Many of the ingredients required to start the process of learning new knowledge from routinely collected clinical data are already in place.

In this paper we consider how ideas and principles from such platforms can usefully be applied in a Grid context, specifically, an Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) context. To this end, we identify weaknesses in OGSA in the areas of generic service provision, scalability/performance engineering, and, especially, lack of support for QoS specification and realization, and suggest how these can be alleviated. We believe that such areas will become increasingly important as sophisticated e-Science applications start to exploit the potential of OGSA's service-based architecture.

We are witnessing the Marine Revolution, which challenges us to develop unifying, ecosystem-based approaches to the science and use of the sea. Knowing (i.e., science) marineprocesses should form the fundamental basis for doing (i.e., conservation and management), within a global human ecological framework.The issues of human ecology are about the same by land or sea, but these subdivisions of Earth are fundamentally different. The sea must be understood in its own right, rather than be driven by terrestrially-derived models. For example, animal diversity is on a species level by land; marine diversity is at higher taxonomic levels and, if viewed functionally, is greater than the land's. This has important implications in the design of protected areas. Another example concerns the roles of large organisms in ocean processes; fishery ecology has been neglected, but a total ecosystem viewpoint is essential towards placing fisheries on a sustainable basis.New perspectives toward the sea are rapidly emerging. Satellites have the potential for revolutionizing oceanography. Ecotoxicology is in the process of addressing pollution on an ecosystem basis.

Accordingly, the sustainable AI-STEAM course with the experiential learning framework has been implemented and verified, so as to confirm that the AI-STEAM course is not too difficult for young students. Many basic concepts involved in the AI-STEAM course, regarding programming logic, electromechanical concepts, interface design, and the application of image recognition, were measured in this study. The results showed that the students not only made significant progress in learning effectiveness, but also in particular made significant improvements in two parts: electromechanical concepts and image recognition knowledge.

A typical such application comprises multiple communicating tasks to be executed on virtualized resources also called as virtual machines (VMs). However, scheduling multiple tasks to VMs is non-trivial and is proven to be NP-Complete. The primary agenda of any scheduling technique is to reduce the makespan, which reflects the completion time of the exit task. Focusing on makespan reduction for scheduling multiple tasks across heterogeneous VMs, in this paper, we propose a model called H3CSA based on a meta-heuristic crow search algorithm (CSA). In order to assess the performance of H3CSA, its performance is compared with baselines such as HEFT-B, HEFT-T, HEFT-L, a genetic algorithm based technique (N-GA) and particle swarm optimization based technique (PPSO). Simulation results show improved performance of H3CSA with respect to N-GA and PPSO for smaller applications. However, considering sizeable applications H3CSA shows comparable performance with respect to N-GA and improved results for PPSO. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Multitasking; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Scheduling; Cloud environments; Communicating tasks; Completion time; E-science applications; Scheduling techniques; Search Algorithms; Task-scheduling; Virtualized resources; Genetic algorithms","Narayan Sahoo, M.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India; email: sahoom@nitrkl.ac.in",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc",21615748,,,,"English","Trans. emerg. telecommun. technol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105523701

Advance reservation (AR) is obligatory on initial-delay-tolerant services, like e-science and grid computing, that are having a remarkable involvement in next-generation internet traffic. In this paper, the authors proposed a routing and spectrum assignment (RSA) algorithm, which improves spectrum utilization by minimizing the blocking probability. This technique ensures spectrum availability for each connection request, but depending on the call arrival time and slot availability, there may be some delay and it is referred as spectrum allocation using reservation. The other proposed algorithm considers reservations based on prediction called as spectrum allocation using prediction and reservation. The simulation results show that the latter technique increases spectrum utilization even more and decreases call blocking compared to existing RSA algorithms.

Despite the shaken faith in ‘grand narratives’, science retains a special cognitive status and a special place in society. To explain this phenomenon, Max Weber’s concept of types of rationality and types of domination is used. The author associates Weber’s concept of the ‘disenchantment of the world’ with the concept of progress. It is shown that the phenomenon of the ‘re-enchantment of the world’ cannot be considered a regression since it depends on the advancement of science and technology. At present, the concept of progress is being replaced by the concept of complication. It is shown that in the situation of the complication and ‘re-enchantment of the world’, the model of rationality is technoscience, i.e., science with its own technical conditions, possibilities, and applications. Technoscience is both an ideal type and concrete historical phenomenon. It forms a theoretical and practical space in which the rational and the extraordinary can coexist. This makes it possible to assert that today’s science can lay claim to the charismatic type of domination, thereby reviving the unviable, according to Max Weber, phenomenon of ‘the charisma of reason’. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","disenchantment and re-enchantment of the world; Progress; rationality; technoscience; types of authority",,"Stoliarova, O.E.; RAS Institute of Philosophy, 12/1 Goncharnaya street, Russian Federation; email: olgastoliarova@mail.ru",,"Routledge",02691728,,,,"English","Soc.

In view of the exascale era of supercomputers that is rapidly approaching, it is of the utmost importance to design novel solutions that can take full advantage of the upcoming computing infrastructures. The convergence of High Performance Computing (HPC) and data-intensive analytics is key to delivering scalable High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA) solutions for scientific and engineering applications. The aim of this paper is threefold: reviewing some of the most relevant challenges towards HPDA at scale, presenting a HPDA-enabled version of the Ophidia framework and validating the scalability of the proposed framework through an experimental performance evaluation carried out in the context of the Centre of Excellence in Simulation of Weather and Climate in Europe (ESiWACE).

In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that provenance traces recorded during execution are also instrumental to answering questions about the observed differences between sets of results obtained from similar but not identical workflow configurations. Such differences in configurations may be introduced deliberately, i.e., to explore process variations or accidentally, typically as the result of porting efforts or of changes in the computing environment. Using a commonly used workflow programming model as a reference, we consider both structural variations in the workflows as well as variations within their individual components. Our why-diff algorithm compares the graph representations of two provenance traces derived from two workflow variations. It produces a delta graph that can be used to produce human-readable explanations of the impact of workflow differences on observed output differences. We report with Neo4j graph database.

Data are accessed by the research communities to produce sophisticated simulations of the earth system and to study the impact of climate change. Although these e-infrastructures provide relevant data, little is known about the User eXperience (UX) and the issues that users face during their interaction with these infrastructures. AIM: This article presents an investigation about the issues that researchers (end-users) may face while interacting with an e-Science infrastructure and consequently, it elucidates obstacles to access required data. METHOD: Supported by Action Research (AR) methodology, this study was carried out in the context of ESGF by analysing different types of stakeholders especially users and the help desk. Based on Grounded Theory (GT), in a deeply qualitative analysis, we examined 655 e-mail threads that were sent to ESGF help desk as there were questions asked by end-users to access the data served by the e-infrastructure. RESULTS: The outcomes revealed that questions related to workflow in the e-infrastructure were the bottlenecks that mostly impact the UX. Based on the classification scheme of the barriers that is derived as a result, after applying GT, we classified such bottlenecks and made suggestions to improve UX in e-Science infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: According to our knowledge, this is the first study focused on discussing UX in e-Science infrastructure as it explains the barriers that limit and delay the research process of scientists while they interact with the e-infrastructure. Henceforth, the full benefit of the data projects hosted by the e-infrastructure is not realized. If these barriers would be treated using a joint-strategy initiated by the stakeholders of an e-infrastructure, the research process for the users will be faster and they will have a better UX. © The Author(s) 2019.

In this paper, we propose the concept of virtual dataspaces and domain scientific data cloud (DSDC) to address the challenges of management, reusability, and service of scientific data in scientific domain. The application of DSDC is also introduced, which is used in the materials science domain for e-Science applications. Virtual dataspaces is then defined, which is used to integrate and organize both structured and unstructured scientific data in cloud environment. To build the virtual dataspaces, a logical resources model based on ontology is discussed. And then a new mapping and evolutionary model of virtual dataspaces is described in a ""pay-as-you-go"" fashion. As such, we introduce a ""semi-automatic evolution"" method. A scientific data cloud application model is also proposed for defining service template. Finally, the virtual dataspaces and DSDC are verified by ""material service safety evaluation"", and the results show that our approach is efficient in scientific data management and suitable for data-intensive application.

Cost benefits for data-intensive applications, ease of access, rich and varied offers for services are examples of positive returns by users. However, beyond this favorable welcome for the technology, some research problems remain and are still challenging. In this paper, we focus on the problems of automatically deploying IaaS for computing and for data management, using the SlapOS Cloud. The core of the system is a distributed protocol for orchestrating data and compute nodes. Using this interaction scheme, users are able to deploy, without any system administrator intervention, a PaaS inside the IaaS basically a Desktop Grid middleware. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that the Desktop Grid and Cloud paradigms may merge and may be widely used by non-experts in the different areas of e-Science. We propose a fully self-organized volunteer Cloud for researchers where they can carry out e-Science experiments and process large amounts of data in a coherent way. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cloud Computing; Desktop Grid; e-Science applications as a service; Emerging platform technologies; Self-configuration of applications; Volunteer Cloud","Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Information management; Middleware; Desktop grid; E-science applications; Platform technology; Self configuration; Volunteer clouds; Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)","Saad, W.; LaTICE, ESSTT 5, Av.

These displays can be connected to distributed computing resources over high-speed network, providing effective means for researchers to visualize, interact with, and understand large volumes of datasets. Typically large display walls are built by tiling multiple physical displays together and running a tiled display wall required a cluster of computers. With the advent of advanced graphics hardware, a single computer can now drive over a dozen displays, thereby greatly reducing the cost of ownership and maintenance of a tiled display wall system. This in turn enables a broader user base to take advantage of such technologies. Since tiled display walls are also well suited to collaborative work, users tend to launch and operate multiple applications simultaneously. To ensure that applications maintain a high degree of responsiveness to the users even under heavy use loads, the display wall must now ensure that the limited system resources are prioritized to maximize interactivity rather than thread-level fair sharing or overall job-completion throughput. In this paper, we present a new resource scheduling scheme that is specifically designed to prioritize responsiveness in collaborative large display wall environments where multiple users can interact with multiple applications simultaneously. We evaluate our scheduling scheme with a user study involving groups of users interacting simultaneously on a tiled display wall with multiple applications. Results show that our scheduling framework provided a higher frame-rate for applications, which led to a significantly higher user performance (approx. 25%) in a target acquisition test when compared against traditional operating system scheduling scheme. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A semantic model for scholarly electronic publishing is proposed, in which the article conclusion is specified by the author and recorded in a machine-understandable format, enabling semantic retrieval, identification of traces of scientific discoveries and knowledge misunderstandings. 89 biomedical articles were analyzed for this purpose. A content model comprising semantic elements and their sequences in articles is developed. Four patterns of reasoning and sequencing of semantic elements were identified in the analyzed articles. The development and testing of a prototype of a Web submission interface to an electronic journal system that partially implements the proposed model are reported. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

This evolution is usually independent of the ontological instance descriptions which are stored in knowledge bases (KBs). Therefore, the effects of an ontology update on instance descriptions which are migrated to a new ontology version should be studied. In this paper, we are interested in the effects of the migration of literal-valued instance triples of an RDF KB to a new ontology version. Note that the datatype of the property of such an instance description may have evolved in the new ontology version, e.g., from integer to decimal or from float to double. We manage the quality of these migrated instance triples and design flexible interactive methods through which the curator of the KB can intervene to correct the 'inaccuracies' of the literal values that are incurred by the migration process. In addition, specialised algorithms are presented, which are highly efficient, since their time and space complexity is linear with respect to the size of the literal-valued instance triples of the KB. Our work is particularly important to e-science applications that are commonly curated and have many datatype properties.

Discovering and representing inherent semantic associations between Web services has attracted much attention due to the wide applications of automatic service discovery and composition. In this paper, we look upon the operations in a WSDL document as service components. An analogy is made between service components and electrons, between Web service and charged body of electrons. First, we are to measure the semantic associations between service components based on the Coulomb force formula in the electrostatic force theory. For this purpose, by statistical computations on the historical logs of service invocations, we give a PageRank-based method for measuring the importance of a service component and define a distance measure between them. Then, by adopting the basic idea of evidence superposition, we give the method for measuring the semantic association between WSDL-described Web services based on those of concerned service components. Our proposal in this paper is intuitively established on the electrostatic force theory, and thus it is physically interpretable.

Programmes were developed to enable students and teachers to access and become involved in local science research and innovation, with the aim being to broaden their awareness of New Zealand science research contexts, adding authenticity and relevance to their school studies. One of these initiatives, known as Science-for-Life, partnered scientists with teachers and students in primary and secondary schools (K-12). A key output from the trial phase of Science-for-Life was the generation of a framework for guiding and coordinating the activities of the eight institutes within the education sector, to improve efficiency, effectiveness and promote sustainability. The framework, based on data gathered from a series of interviews with each institute's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), an online questionnaire, and informed by findings from trial partnership case studies published as institute technical reports and published articles, is presented in this paper.

CMI is a software entity that can migrate from one site to another in order to satisfy its goals in cloud workflow system. However, if a large number of CMIs migrate to one work machine within a short period of time, congestion is so serious that the average executive time for CMIs would be much longer due to the competition for the limited resources. In this paper, we introduce the queuing conception into cloud workflow system to solve this problem. Two queuing models are created for corresponding two different types of work machine, called sole work-node model and compound work-node model. For each model, a set of detailed queuing rules, service rules and the CMI dispatching mechanism are defined. We choose P/N/m/∞ queuing model to implement queuing mechanism in sole work-node model, and use dynamic priority queue to manage waiting CMI. Compound work-node is made up of a lot of sole work-nodes, when a CMI migrated to one compound work-node, it would be dispatched to one sole-work node according to the task type to be executed. The effectiveness of the queuing mechanism is evident in that it can alleviate the load of work nodes, which are illustrated with the experiment results at the end of paper. © 2013 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.","Cloud workflow; Intelligent agent; Migrating workflow system; Queuing mechanism",,"Xiuguo, W.; School of Management Science and Engineering, China",,,18286003,,,,"English","Int.

Portal technologies and portal-based virtual research and learning environments (VREs and VLEs) already have become standard infrastructures within a large number of research communities and institutions. From 2004, a series of research and development projects began to ask the question whether an open source videoconferencing and collaboration system could be used as a complete, or as a part of, VRE. This study presents the evolution of these projects and at the same time, describes the definition of a VRE and their future possible integration. The OneVRE portlet integration project attempted to create missing components, including adding secure and universal identity management. This moves the idea of shared data to a different level by creating a new administrative domain that is outside the control of a single local institution portal and resolves certain administrative virtual organizations problems.

A recent branch of sociology, the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), states that relations among human and nonhuman actors are equally important to understand social phenomena. Since scientists are potential users of huge computational support, their communities provide relevant cases for domain characterization and software design. This paper investigates the possibilities of using ANT to characterize a real instance of those social networks. The active role of nonhuman actors allows us to trace the relations based on material clues left behind by the actors, and also to bring forth features to be explored by the social software. The results of a structural study offer a graphical representation that allows quantitative and qualitative analysis of the social network, while the temporal evolution case study suggests that cyclic associations are more likely to persist. These outcomes may inform a better design of Web 2.0 systems for those communities. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Actor-Network Theory; e-Science; Multimodal networks; Social networks; Sociology","Computation theory; Social sciences; Social sciences computing; Software design; Actor network theory; Domain characterization; E-sciences; Graphical representations; Multimodal network; Quantitative and qualitative analysis; Sociology; Structural studies; Social networking (online)","Prado, A.B.; Institute of Computing, Brazil; email: aprado@ic.unicamp.br",,"Springer-Verlag Wien",18695450,,,,"English","Soc.

Currently, data distribution issues are being resolved by adopting an advanced Internet technology called software defined networking (SDN). Stability of the SDN operations and management is demanded to keep the federated LHC data distribution networks reliable. Therefore, in this paper, an SDN operation architecture based on the distributed virtual network operations center (DvNOC) is proposed to enable LHC researchers to assume full control of their own global end-to-end data dissemination. This may achieve an enhanced data delivery performance based on data traffic offloading with delay variation. The evaluation results indicate that the overall end-to-end data delivery performance can be improved over multi-domain SDN environments based on the proposed federated SDN/DvNOC operation framework. © 2013 The Korean Physical Society.","Federated operations; High energy physics; LHC; Software-defined-networking",,"Byeon, O.; National Institute of Supercomputing and Networking, , Daejeon, 305-806, South Korea; email: ohbyeon@kisti.re.kr",,"Korean Physical Society",03744884,,,,"English","J.

Transactional memory simplifies the implementation of a variety of concurrent data structures. In this paper, we study the benefits of a modest, real-time aware, hardware implementation of transactional memory that we call micro-transactions. In particular, we argue that hardware support for micro-transactions allows us to efficiently implement certain data structures. Those data structures are difficult to realize with the atomic operations provided by stock hardware and provide real-time guarantees for those operations. Our main implementation platform is the Java Optimized Processor system, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of the Java virtual machine, optimized for real-time Java. We report on the performance of data structures implemented with locks, atomic instructions, and micro-transactions. Our results suggest that transactional memory is an interesting alternative to traditional concurrency control mechanisms.

The application of this measure has various potential benefits, including the ability to measure students' needs, guide their development, and understand the influence of training on their career interests over time. We used the O*Net database to draw information regarding what critical work tasks are performed by industrial/organizational (I/O) psychologists -these work tasks were used to build items for the practitioner scale of the SPI-IO. Leong and Zachar developed a scientist scale for an earlier version of the SPI used to assess career orientations in counseling and clinical psychology. The scientist scale is composed of items that are also relevant for I/O psychology. Together, Leong and Zachar's scientist scale and our newly developed practitioner scale comprise the SPI-IO. In Study 1, we used the SPI-IO to measure career orientations in undergraduates and found support for the measure's construct validity. In Study 2, we assessed career orientations in I/O psychology graduate students. With the graduate sample, we sought to again support the SPI-IO's validity and also to determine whether the SPI-IO could account for more variance in career specialty choice (i.e., science vs. practice) than more general measures of career interests (i.e., RIASEC). In all cases, the validity and unique predictive utility of the SPI-IO was confirmed.

Such projects present distinctive challenges which have been neglected by existing escience research and information systems (IS) literature. The paper aims to define a research framework for understanding and evaluating the social, political and collaborative challenges of such projects. Design/methodology/approach: The paper develops a research framework which extends Orlikowski and Gash's concept of technological frames to consider two additional frames specific to such grid projects; bureaucratic frames and collaborator frames. These are used to analyse a case study of a grid development project within Healthcare which aimed to deploy a European data-grid of medical images to facilitate collaboration and communication between clinicians across the European Union. Findings: That grids are shaped to a significant degree by the collaborative practices involved in their construction, and that for projects involving commercial and public partners such collaboration is inhibited by the differing interpretive frames adopted by the different relevant groups. Research limitations/implications: The paper is limited by the nature of the grid development project studied, and the subsequent availability of research subjects. Practical implications: The paper provides those involved in such projects, or in policy around such grid developments, with a practical framework by which to evaluate collaborations and their impact on the emergent grid. Further, the paper presents lessons for future such Interventionist grid projects. Originality/value: This is a new area for research but one which is becoming increasingly important as data-intensive computing begins to emerge as foundational to many collaborative sciences and enterprises. The work builds on significant literature in escience and IS drawing into this new domain. The research framework developed here, drawn from the IS literature, begins a new stream of systems development research with a distinct focus on bureaucracy, collaboration and technology within such interventionist grid development projects. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cloud; Collaboration; E-science; Grid computing; Health information systems; Health services; Information systems; Information systems development",,"Venters, W.; Department of Management, , London, United Kingdom; email: w.venters@lse.ac.uk",,,09593845,,,,"English","Inf.

This e-publication in a form of WWW page, apart from the traditional textual and graphical content, embeds an on-line software tool for the analysis of the 3-D structure of protein based on the hydrophobicity distribution in protein body. The tool uses GridSpace2 platform in order to carry out computations on the PL-Grid [4] high-performance computing infrastructure. This work shows how this specific epublication was accomplished utilizing above mentioned already existing information technologies and e-infrastructure. The tool employs the model called “fuzzy oil drop” that assumes the hydrophobicity distribution in proteins being in form of 3-D Gauss function. The protein of the hydrophobicity core structure accordant with the model with all hydrophobic residues buried in the central part of the protein body and hydrophilic residues exposed toward the water environment could be the protein very well soluble although representing no any form of activity. This is why the observed discrepancies between idealized and observed hydrophobicity distribution is presented in form of δ$i profile revealing the localization of residues representing local hydrophobicity excess as well as local hydrophobicity deficiency. The distribution of these discrepancies appeared to be specific and function related. The e-publication makes available the tool to calculate the δ$i profile of any protein under consideration.

These experiments involve data discovery, knowledge discovery, integration, linking, and analysis through different software tools and activities. Scientific workflow is one technique through which such activities and processes can be interlinked, automated, and ultimately shared amongst the collaborating scientists. Workflows are realized by the workflow enactment engine, which interprets the process definition and interacts with the workflow participants. Since workflows are typically executed on a shared and distributed infrastructure, the information on the workflow activities, data processed, and results generated (also known as provenance), needs to be recorded in order to be reproduced and reused. A range of solutions and techniques have been suggested for the provenance of data collection and analysis; however, these are predominantly workflow enactment engine and domain dependent.

At the same time, these global technologies after becoming an integral part of the national sciences create and promote the new forms of organizing research corresponding to the globalized world science; that is, modern ICTs per se appear as a tool of globalization and transition to the information society. Both mentioned aspects of ICTs influence give enough motivation to investigate the real processes in those scientific communities that are assimilating this innovation. It is important to note that before our study, the productivity of ICTs within the sciences was not proved, although in principle it was not doubted. This article analyzes the process of ICTs assimilation in the Russian academic community (1994-2004), including dynamics of indicators characterizing not only the level of ICTs use but also their act on professional life and productivity of scientists as well. On the basis of empirical data from Russia obtained during 10 years of sociological monitoring, the research reveals the positive correlation between the level of ICTs use by scientists and their professional success. The new ""virtual"" types of science organizations, such as virtual laboratories and a grid system, that are considered as offshoots of globalization, are not typical to Russian academic science, which keeps safe a more traditional style. Nonetheless, some issues connected with the long-term prospects of e-science are also discussed. © 2007 Brill Academic Publishers.","E-science; ICTS use; International grid system; National scientific communities; Network communication; Professional activities; Scientific productivity; Virtual laboratories","communication; globalization; information technology; innovation; modernization; networking; science and technology; technological development; Eurasia; Russian Federation","Mirskaya, E.; Department of Sociology, , Moscow, Russian Federation; email: elena-mirskaya@mail.ru",,,15691500,,PGDTA,,"English","Perspect.

Whilst currently not supporting all WSRP functionalities, open-source portal frameworks could in future use WSRP Consumers to access remote portlets found from a WSRP Producer registry service. This implies that we need a central registry for the remote portlets and a more expressive WSRP Consumer interface to implement the remote portlet functions. This paper reports on an investigation into a new system architecture, which includes a Web Services repository, registry, and client interface. The Web Services repository holds portlets as remote resource producers. A new data structure for expressing remote portlets is found and published by populating a Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) registry. A remote portlet publish and search engine for UDDI has also been developed. Finally, a remote portlet client interface was developed as a Web application. The client interface supports remote portlet features, as well as window status and mode functions.

The well-established field of humanities computing provides an interesting counterpoint. We use the methodological techniques of 'secondary analysis' and 'visual research', two currently marginal approaches within sociological research but with huge potential within e-environments, as lenses through which the potentials and pitfalls of Grid-supported qualitative work might be anticipated. Rather than a concern with the technical however, we argue for a concurrent attention to the methodological in relation to technological developments. We find that current developments in the qualitative field are more in line with the interests of the humanities and this may shape and constrain the research that sociologists could do. Also, that the conditions to support innovative sociological developments for qualitative Grid computing are not currently well developed or supported. We conclude that in order for a more progressive e-social science agenda to emerge, a broader constituency of sociological researchers should engage with the technological debate, otherwise we risk missing out on opportunities to shape emerging technologies to our research needs.","E-social science; Grid technology; Humanities computing; Secondary analysis; Visual sociology",,"Hodgson, S.M.; University of SheffieldUnited Kingdom",,"University of Surrey",13607804,,,,"English","Sociol.

The main use of synchrotron radiation (SR) facilities by protein crystallographers is to collect the best possible diffraction data for reasonably well defined problems. Significant effort is therefore being made throughout the world to automate SR protein crystallography facilities so scientists can achieve high throughput, even if they are not expert in all the techniques.

The Grid is an attempt to build a virtual abstract operating system, over an arbitrarily large globally distributed collection of heterogeneous resources. The Grid models of authentification, authorisation and accounting, aspire to delivering a single sign-on mechanism for access to this global computer. These models also support dynamic sharing and virtual organisations. The emerging model of composition is based on web services. Has the database research community done this already? Does the DBMS we have today already fit as components in this 'global' machine? Those DBMS contain many of the resources scientists use, and the scientists want more of them, with even more data. There are more research questions than answers so far, and this talk will seek to engage the Database community in addressing them. Digital data are now fundamental to all branches of science and engineering; they play a major role in medical research and diagnosis, and underpin business and governmental decision processes. Increasingly these data are organised as shared and structured collections, which are held in databases, in structured documents and in structured assemblies of binary files. The advent of ubiquitous Internet computing and the scale of modern challenges, such as deciphering the function of all the genes in a large number of species, from bacteria to crops, farm animals and humans, has led to widespread collaboration in the creation, curation, publication, management and exploitation of these structured collections. Although individual collections are typically specialized to hold data of interest to particular communities, substantial advances can be achieved by combining information from multiple data resources. For example, astronomers are building virtual observatories, where data collected at different frequencies, X-ray, radio, optical, infrared, etc., and at different times, can be conveniently combined to discover new properties of the universe. Similarly, functional genomics requires comparison between species, integration with protein biochemistry and crystallography databases, laboratory phenotypical data and population studies. Almost every application involves the execution of computational models or computationally demanding analyses using data from diverse sources. These diverse structured collections are geographically distributed, hosted on a variety of platforms and administered independently according to differing policies. As they increase in scale and number it becomes impractical to arrange their integration by taking local copies or by constructing ad hoc integration schemes. The Grid provides a platform that potentially enables a systematic approach to this integration. It can support authentication and authorisation, resource discovery, data transmission, process creation and scheduling, and dynamic binding across heterogeneous platforms. These facilities could form a consistent foundation for systematic data access and integration that would be a significant advance over current practice, where each environmental requirement of an integration scheme has to be handled separately on each platform. The Grid's designers and implementers need to consider data access and integration as a primary application target for two reasons. Firstly, a great many of the applications of the Grid include a significant data access and integration requirement. Virtually every scientific, engineering, medical and decision-support application depends on accessing distributed heterogeneous collections of structured data. Secondly, the Grid itself uses many structured data collections for its own operation and administration. As Grid technology becomes more sophisticated and autonomic, the number, volume and diversity of these collections will increase. It is therefore imperative that Grid designers and developers support and use systematic data access and integration methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.",,"Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Authentification; Distributed collections; Dynamic sharing; Extended abstracts; Grid model; Heterogeneous resources; Single sign on; Virtual organisations; Web services","Atkinson, M.P.; National e-Science Centre, 15 South College Street, Edinburgh, EH8 9AA, United Kingdom; email: mpa@dcs.gla.ac.uk","James A.Younas M.Lings B.","Springer Verlag",03029743,3540405364; 9783540405368,,,"English","Lect.

The empirical material was limited to articles written by Swedish researchers during the period 1950-1989 and published in international scientific journals utilizing a peer-review system. A model was developed to represent what Swedish researchers have regarded as the core of the acidification theory. Guided by the developed model, a qualitative content analysis of the scientific articles was conducted; i.e., we examined how central components and causal relationships of the theory have been explained and discussed. It should be emphasized that the present article describes an investigation of science itself (i.e., science in action) and is not an up-to-date review of acidification research. Our analysis revealed that some parts of the chain of evidence underlying the acidification theory were accepted before they were scrutinized by the scientific community and that the acidification complex was not conceptualized in accordance with the conceptualization of its various components. Actually, the acidification problem as a whole (i.e., the sum of all of its components) was not treated as a scientific theory that needed to be evaluated. This strongly indicates that the conceptualization was guided by factors that are generally, within the scientific community, considered to be external to the research process. There is no evidence that Swedish acidification research has adhered less stringently to scientific norms than environmental research in general has. Indeed, it is likely that such hidden patterns normally influence the conceptualization of science and we, therefore, conclude that the influence of factors that are not strictly a part of the research process must be further elucidated if the prerequisites and implications of research are to be clarified.","Acidification; Research process; Scientific conceptualization",,,,"National Research Council of Canada",11818700,,ENRVE,,"English","Environ Rev",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7444248027

To satisfy those requirements the paper proposes a novel idea to use the existing well-established Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure together with a suitable data model as a service endpoint registry. The presented ARC Hierarchical Endpoints Registry (ARCHERY) system consists of a minimalistic data model representing services and their endpoints within e-Infrastructures, a rendering of the data model embedded into DNS-records, a lightweight software layer for DNS-record management and client-side data discovery. Our approach for the ARCHERY registry required minimal software development and inherits all the benefits of one of the most reliable distributed information discovery source of the internet, the DNS infrastructure. In particular, deployment, management and operation of ARCHERY is fully relying on DNS.

Steel (2007) pioneered a meta-analysis to explicitly reveal the nature of procrastination and sparked intensive research on its demographic characteristics. However, conflicting and heterogeneous findings reported in the existing literature make it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. In addition, there is still room to further investigate on more sociodemographic features that include socioeconomic status, cultural differences and procrastination education. To this end, we performed quantitative sociodemographic meta-analyses (k = 193, total n = 106,764) to fill this gap. It was found that the general tendency and academic procrastination tendency of males were stronger than females (r = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.02–0.05). No significant effects of differences in socioeconomic status (i.e., poor or rich), multiculturalism (i.e., Han nation or minorities), nationality (i.e., China or other countries), family size (i.e., one child or > 1 child), and educational background (i.e., science or arts/literature) were found to affect procrastination tendencies. Furthermore, it was noteworthy that the gender differences in procrastination tendencies were prominently moderated by measurements, which has a greater effect on the Aitken Procrastination Inventory (API) (r = 0.035, 95% CI: −0.01–0.08) than on the General Procrastination Scale (GPS) (r = 0.018, 95% CI: −0.01–0.05). In conclusion, this study provides robust evidence that males tended to procrastinate more than females in general and academic profiles, and further indicates that procrastination tendencies do not vary based on sociodemographic situations, including socioeconomic status, multiculturalism, nationality, family size, and educational background.

Hence, this study investigates the data librarianship core concepts (motivational factors, challenges, skills and appropriate training platforms) to learn and successfully launch data librarianship services. Design/methodology/approach: A survey method was used and the data were collected through online questionnaire. Purposive sampling method was applied and 132 responses were received with 76 respondents from the public and 56 from the private sector universities of Pakistan. The statistical package for social sciences (SPSS version 25) was used, and descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to analyzed the data. Findings: LIS professionals understand the importance of data-driven library services and perceive that such services are helpful in evolving the image of the library, helping with the establishment of institutional data repositories/data banks, developing data resources and services for library patrons and especially researchers, and receiving appreciation and acknowledgment from the higher authorities. The major challenges that emerged from the data were: missing data policies, limited training opportunities for data librarianship roles, no additional financial benefits, lack of infrastructure and systems, lack of organizational support for the initiation of data-driven services, and lack of skills, knowledge and expertise. Data librarianship is in its early stages in Pakistan, and consequently, the LIS professionals are lacking basic, advanced and technical data-driven skills. Research limitations/implications: The policy, theoretical and practical implications describe an immediate need for framing data policies. Such policies will help the libraries or any other relevant entities to store the data and assign metadata and documentation in such a way that it is easy to retrieve and reusable for others.

It comes to the conclusion that this remark can be regarded as a strategy by the author to defend the imagined prestige of the Ottoman Muslim identity. © 2022 Istanbul Universitesi.

This scenario categorizes a Scientific Software Ecosystem, which involves researchers and scientists working together, using scientific software and related services through scientific workflows. However, to develop scientific workflows, users need suitable platforms to comply with experiment requirements. This paper describes two services designed on top of an open-source E-science Software Ecosystem (E-SECO) platform to support researchers’ activities during the scientific workflow life cycle. Such services focus on data integration and provenance data to support experiment reuse. We conducted two different case studies in a Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation.

The results highlighted science interest and science utility positively influencing science achievement through a sequential pathway of mediators, including science self-efficacy and science identity. The strength of direct effects considerably varied across students, resulting in classifying them into four subgroups. For instance, among females with a low SES subgroup, developing substantial science interest would result in better science self-efficacy and science identity that flourish science achievement.

Online workflow executes in a collaborative and distributed environment and is prone to fraud and information leakage. Workflow authorization models are implemented to ensure that tasks are performed by authorized subjects with compliance of security/privacy polices. However, existing workflow authorization models have some limitations. First, most of the existing research focuses on static workflows, where an order arriving at a workflow traverses tasks in a fixed sequence. In many real applications, however, task routing is not deterministic, having a probability distribution or pattern that may be estimated from historical data. Second, existing research ignores practical resource constraints, like user utilization, order waiting time, etc. To address the limitations, this article studies the workflow authorization model under the more realistic dynamic settings. We formulate a workflow as a queueing system, so business constraints can be analytically represented, under reasonable assumptions. We model the studied problems as pseudo-Boolean satisfiaiblity problems and investigate their theoretical properties. We also develop algorithms and carry out computational studies. The experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of our developed solutions.

Much of this success is due to their ability to provide generic functionality for modeling, execution and monitoring processes. These functionalities work well when process execution follows a well-behaved path towards achieving the models objectives. However, exceptions and anomalous situations that fall outside of the well-behaved execution path still pose a significant challenge to PAIS. The treatment for such exceptions usually involves interventions in systems by human operators, which result in significant additional cost for businesses. In this paper, we introduce a cost-aware recovery composition method that is able to find and follow recovery paths that reduce the cost of exception handling. From a practical point of view, our proposal reduces complexity and the need for manual interventions to handle exceptions. Finally, the feasibility of recovery mechanism is discussed from its implementation into WED-flow framework. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","exception handling; Process-aware information systems; reliability; robustness; WED-flow","Automobiles; Database systems; Industry; Information systems; Information use; Mathematical transformations; Recovery; Reliability; Robustness (control systems); Composition method; Exception handling; Manual intervention; Monitoring process; Process execution; Process-aware information systems; Recovery mechanisms; WED-flow; Large scale systems","Schwerz, A.L.; Department of Computing, Paraná, Brazil; email: andreluis@utfpr.edu.br",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",19391374,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

However, most K-12 teachers are trained within their own subject discipline and may not be capable of implementing an integrated approach to STEM education. There is therefore a need to develop teacher professional development (TPD) programs that can provide high-quality learning opportunities and support for teachers. The overarching goal of this research synthesis is to develop a set of design principles for effective TPD for integrated STEM education. To this end, this paper reviews 48 empirical studies and identifies the elements of effective TPD and potential challenges to implementing integrated STEM education. Content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and sample STEM instructional materials are the three most frequently reported elements of effective TPD programs. However, even with TPD, teachers encounter various obstacles to the implementation of integrated STEM education, including pedagogical challenges (e.g., teachers’ limited STEM knowledge) and structural challenges (e.g., teachers’ lack of preparation time and resources). Based on the findings of this review, a set of design principles (e.g., allocate TPD time for teachers’ micro-teaching) is proposed. This review contributes to the design and implementation of TPD programs by leveraging studies of the effective elements of TPD and addressing the potential challenges to integrated STEM education. © 2021","Literature review; Professional development; STEM education; STEM integration; Teacher education",,"Lo, C.K.; Department of Mathematics and Information Technology, Hong Kong; email: chungkwanlo@eduhk.hk",,"International Forum of Educational Technology and Society",11763647,,,,"English","Educational Technology and Society",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117935471

In general, it is a functional expression of both foreign and science policy conducted by states and non-state actors in the world arena. The emergence of the modern concept of science diplomacy has been taking place since the second half of the 2000s linking research and diplomatic practices. Still, most of the existing literature can be described as somewhat fragmentary and focusing on specific case studies without providing a holistic picture of national science diplomacy models, including the Russian one. The article casts light upon the critical features of the Russian science diplomacy complex based on a systematic approach. It looks into its three main elements, i.e., ""science in diplomacy,"" ""diplomacy for science,"" and ""science for diplomacy."" In this context, the article analyses the activity of the Russian science diplomacy main stakeholders in positive and normative terms. The synthesis of the respective results reveals structural drawbacks of the system in question, which in 2020 have become even more acute than they used to be before. The outlined trends and tendencies infer that the ongoing pandemic did hardly bring on new problems but speeded up processes, which have already around this field. Working from these premises, the author formulates several policy recommendations to optimize current practices, which decision-makers can use in science diplomacy and foreign affairs. © 2021, MGIMO Universty Press.

Drawing on attendee survey data from eleven science festivals across the United States (n = 1,645) and evaluation surveys from a statewide school-based festival program (n = 2,320), we explore the concept of science capital (i.e. science-related cultural capital, science-related social capital, and science-related behavior and practices) within science festival programs. Using linear regression, we utilize attendee demographics and event characteristics to predict shifts in science capital. Our results indicate that members of STEM minority groups (i.e. girls and women; Black/African Americans, Latino/Hispanic/Latinx, Native Americans, Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders) report greater shifts in science capital scores. Time at event and scientist interactions at the event are also associated with greater shifts in scientific cultural capital. We interpret these findings in light of Philip and Azevedo's work (2017) on out-of-school science learning and equity. As a concept, science capital offers a useful lens through which to view informal science learning, science communication, and how public science events (e.g. science festivals) play an important role in contributing to the local STEM learning ecosystem. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","family science; informal learning; informal science learning; out-of-school learning; Science capital; science festivals",,"Gathings, M.J.; Karen Peterman Consulting, United States; email: jen.gathings@etrservices.org",,"Routledge",21548455,,,,"English","Intl.

This study investigated whether the use of ICT at school is linked to students ‘learning outcomes in Finland. We used the Finnish PISA 2015 data (N=5037). Cognitive learning outcomes (i.e. science, mathematics, reading, collaborative problem-solving) were evaluated with computer-based tests. ICT use at school, ICT availability at school, and students’ perceived ICT competence were assessed with self-rating questionnaires. Frequent ICT use at school predicted students’ weaker performance in all the cognitive learning outcomes, when adjusted for age, gender, parental socioeconomic status, students’ ICT competence, and ICT availability at school. Further, the effect of ICT use on learning outcomes was more negative in students with higher than lower ICT skills. Frequent use of ICT at school appears to be linked to weaker cognitive learning outcomes in Finland. This may be explained by working memory overload and task-switching during the use of digital technologies. This finding also suggests that even though students with ICT skills are good at mechanical use of digital device, they may not have abilities for a goal-oriented and self-directed use of digital technologies that could promote their learning. © 2021, Hipatia Editorial.

They help close ‘digital divides’ between and within countries and are an essential factor for national and international development. In collaboration with the West and Central African Research and Education Network (WACREN), the TANDEM project has developed a roadmap for the development of NRENs in the region. This was based on the results of a survey that was conducted to investigate user requirements of networked services. The analysis of the 561 responses to a three-part questionnaire divided into 11 education, 22 research and 2 technical management questions identified key educational and research service needs. This article reports on the results of the survey with respect to research services. Highlights include respondents wanting regular access to online conference and academic articles (89%), a range of research services including online library resources, video conferencing, collaboration tools, online data access and storage, online library resources and inter-university login (>87%), access to remote computing facilities (80%) and high performance computing facilities (77%). A desire to share data with others online (74%) was also identified. Respondents also indicated that they would like to access research services through a range of device types–Laptops (96%), Fixed PC (86%) and Mobile Devices (81%). Poor network connectivity was consistently identified as being a major barrier to research in the region. © The Author(s) 2018.","e-infrastructure; e-science; national research and education networks; open science",,"Kashefi, A.; Brunel UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: armin.kashefi@brunel.ac.uk",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",02666669,,,,"English","Inf.

Specifically, e-science applied in health discipline is called e-health. It is an organized system that deals to diagnose and treat patients. Considering trust is an important role and fundamental for the provision of effective healthcare service, this paper discusses trust requirement in e-health. To highlight the importance of trust in e-health system, a conceptual framework of trust requirements in e-health system is developed. Drawn from literature search framed by STARLITE, a conceptual framework that addresses trust resulting from relationships of various actors based on two perspectives: sociotechnical and technical perspectives are presented. This framework suggests that e-health system must build a trust relationship between actors and understand trust based on sociotechnical and technical perspectives. Further, security and privacy that protect the confidentiality of patient's data, especially m-health (mobile health) also need trust in resource sharing. It can be concluded that trust requirements in e-health depend on how the media transmits a social experience, patient-system relationship, and collaboration of software engineering and healthcare professionals. The implementation of trust requirements has the potential to produce well-engineered software in a healthcare organization, resulting in the use of software for effective diagnosis and treatment of patients. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

The challenging issues to solve the above problem includes what knowledge foundation supports sentence linking process and how to link these unordered short texts for pursuing well coherence. Herein, the authors develop bridging inference based sentence linking model by simulating human beings' discourse bridging process, which narrows semantic coherence gaps between short texts. Such model supports linking process by implicit and explicit knowledge and proposes different bridging inference schemas to guide the linking process. The bridging inference based linking process under different schemas generates different semantic coherence including central semantics, concise semantics and layered semantics etc. To validate the bridging inference based sentence linking model, the authors conduct some experiments. Experimental results confirm that the proposed bridging inference based sentence linking process increases semantic coherence. The model can be used in short- Text origination, e-learning, e-science, web semantic search, and online question- Answering system in the future works.

But one the main difficulties, which scientists face is necessity to have an expertise for design new workflow-applications or reuse already existing ones. The contribution of this paper consists of formal models of the VSO internal structures and user-assistance logic, which may be obtained as a result of the reasoning over knowledge base.","Domain knowledge integration; Scientific experiment; Workflow composite application","Knowledge based systems; Composite applications; Computational experiment; Domain knowledge; Multidisciplinary problems; Scientific experiments; Simulated experiments; Virtual simulations; Workflow applications; Computation theory","Han, K.; North China University of Water Resources and Electric PowerChina",,"Ukrmetallurginform Scientific and Technical Agency Ltd",20760507,,,,"English","Metall.

Unfortunately different communities often use incompatible resource management systems. In this work we try to alleviate the difficulties occurring on bridging the gap between different research eco-systems by federating resources and thus unifying resource access. To this end, our solution presented in this paper outlines a secure, simple, yet highly interoperable and flexible architecture using RESTful Web services and WebDAV. While, first and foremost in the Grid computing domain, there are already standards and solutions in place addressing related problems, our solution differs from those approaches by allowing to federate data storage systems that are not aware of being federated. Access to these is enabled by our federation layer using storage system specific connectors. Hence, our federation approach is intended as an abstraction layer on top of existing storage or middleware solutions, allowing for a more uniform access mechanism. Additionally, our solution also allows for submission and management of computational jobs on said data, thereby federating not only data but also computational resources. Once resource access is unified, information from different data formats can be semantically unified by information extraction methods. It is our belief that the work in this paper can complement existing Grid computing efforts by facilitating access to data storage system not inherently available via commonly used Grid computing standards. © 2013 Daivandy et al.; licensee Springer.","Data federation; Grid computing; Identity federation centralized security; Identity management; Information extraction; Interoperability; Knowledge extraction; Metadata federation; Resource federation; Single sign-on; Trust delegation; Uniform access; WebDAV","Abstracting; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Digital storage; Grid computing; Information retrieval; Interoperability; Middleware; Web services; Data federation; Identity federation; Identity management; Knowledge extraction; Resource federation; Single sign on; Trust delegation; Uniform access; WebDAV; Information management","Daivandy, M.; Jülich Supercomputing Centre, , 52428 Jülich, Germany; email: j.daivandy@fz-juelich.de",,"Springer London",18674828,,,,"English","J.

At the same time, the availability and models of use of networked computing resources needed by e-Science are rapidly changing and see the coexistence of many disparate paradigms: high performance computing, grid and recently cloud, which brings very promising expectations due to its high flexibility. In this paper we suggest a model to promote the convergence and the integration of different computing paradigms and infrastructures for the dynamic on-demand provisioning of the resources needed by e-Science environments, leveraging the Service-Oriented Architecture model. In addition, its design aims at endorsing a flexible, modular, workflow-based collaborative environment for e-Science.

After presenting a classification for the scientific web services, a comprehensive framework for the e-Research process is proposed. Also, the effects of the scientific web services on adoption of the e-Research process are studied. For this purpose, an appropriate questionnaire was prepared and delivered to the graduate students in the Engineering and Management disciplines of Tarbiat Modares and Amirkabir universities, located in Tehran, to assess the scientific web services' usages in their research processes development. After analysis of the acquired data, the findings showed that the scientific web services of information storage and sharing, searching, and communications are the most popular and useful web services in the scientific community, and therefore, have great effects on the adoption of the e-Research process so that the more convenient and desirable these services are, the more popular they get.","E-research process; E-science; Electronic scientific database; Scientific web service",,"Khatibi, V.; Tarbiat Modares UniversityIran; email: vahid.khatibi@gmail.com",,,20088302,,,,"English","Int.

As a multi-grid environment, the accounting process of WLCG is currently enabled by four accounting systems, each of which was developed independently by constituent grid projects. These accounting systems were designed and implemented based on project-specific local understanding of requirements, and therefore lack interoperability. In order to automate the accounting process in WLCG, three transportation methods are being introduced for streaming accounting data metered by heterogeneous accounting systems into GOC at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) in the UK, where accounting data are aggregated and accumulated throughout the year. These transportation methods, however, were introduced on a per accounting-system basis, i.e., targeting at a particular accounting system, making them hard to reuse and customize to new requirements.

A few advanced networks, mainly National Research and Education Networks (NRENs), such as Surfnet, National Lambda Rail and Internet 2, now provide mechanisms for end-users to reserve and provision lightpaths via middleware referred to as Network Resource Mangers (NRMs). Although, some progress has been made in automated intra-domain lightpath services, inter-domain lightpath provisioning still requires manual intervention and presents several key challenges such as scalability of topology information exchanged, consistency and scalability of information model, security of access to the resources, hybrid networking and multi-layer lightpaths, and accounting and billing. In this paper, we describe a new architectural framework called Global Lambda Integrated Facility (GLIF) Interdomain Resource Reservation Architecture (GIRRA) with the goal to provide an integrated response to these challenges. We propose a new approach to model GLIF network domains and GOLEs as virtual switches and to describe their behavior, functionality, policy capabilities, and topology aggregation. We define an inter-domain path computation model to determine paths that meet constraints and access policy restrictions. We propose a security framework for authentication and authorization of users and a model for accounting and billing that aims to provide easy and secure access to the resources. Key aspects of the GIRRA solution are that it focuses on the inter-dependence between different challenges of inter-domain path provision, and it is built around already existing solutions for intra-domain resource provisioning. © 2010 Institut Télécom and Springer-Verlag.","GLIF; Inter-domain networking; Middleware; Path computation; Security","Access policies; Advanced networks; Architectural frameworks; Authentication and authorization; e-Science; End-users; GLIF; Grid resource; Information models; Integrated response; Inter-dependences; Inter-domain; Internet2; Intra-domain; Light path; Lightpath provisioning; Manual intervention; Network domains; Network resource; New approaches; Path computation; Research and education network; Resource provisioning; Resource reservations; Security; Security frameworks; Topology aggregations; Topology information; Authentication; Data transfer; Fiber optic networks; Grid computing; Middleware; Network architecture; Scalability; Security of data; Telecommunication networks; Topology","Karmous-Edwards, G.; Department of Electrical Engineering, Pockelsstrae 14, 38106 Brunswick, Germany; email: gigi_ke@ncsu.edu",,,00034347,,ANTEA,,"English","Ann Telecommun",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650869128

In order to find out an insect's unsteady force generation mechanism, the blowfly's realistic wing motion is simulated. The numerical simulation shows a very complex flow feature and an unexpectedly large amount of aerodynamic force. Lift is mainly generated during the downstroke motion because of the highly effective angle of attack. On the other hand, a large amount of thrust is generated abruptly at the end of the upstroke motion. Furthermore, a parametric study of the flapping wing motion is efficiently performed to examine the effect of the geometric factors of an insect's wing motion by using the e-AIRS PSS system. From extensive numerical results and careful comparisons, we observed that the ""figure-of-eight"" motion was helpful to generate thrust during the upstroke, and the inclined stroke motion was beneficial to generate lift during the downstroke. From the study of a wing's sectional shape, we observed that camber improved lift generation, but deteriorated aerodynamic performance. When the geometric effect of the nerve is considered, however, not only thrust but also the aerodynamic performance is enhanced.","Aerodynamic force generation; E-AIRS; e-Science environment; Insect flight; Unsteady flow",,"Klm, J.-H.; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, , Seoul 151-742, South Korea",,,03744884,,,,"English","J.

Also, unsteady motion of a detached rocket booster has been predicted by using an external flow analysis with an aerodynamic-dynamic coupled solver. A Korean e-Science environment designed for aerospace engineering, e-AIRS [15], supplies a user-friendly interface for such individual work and it can advance to an integrated rocket simulation of internal combustion and external flow variation by controlling the execution and data flow of two flow solvers.

One good example of an e-science application is the VO. The primary goal of the VO is to collect observed data from many telescopes and instruments and to construct a software system for managing heterogeneous data. The other is to allow transparency and to provide the ability to access data distributed throughout the world. Astrometry-oriented projects are currently developed and have been greatly enriched because of the prototype of a VO system. Astrometry is essential to calculate positional variations by using multiple observations of the same object. We used an Aladin sky atlas system of the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center (CDS) for retrieving data. The Aladin sky atlas system is the best candidate of a VO architecture system and can make searches for various kinds of data available. The bipolar outflow objects in star-forming regions are useful targets for astrometric studies. We obtained two images of HH 896 and calculated the proper motions of the bow-shocks observed in the bipolar outflow. Based on our observation and the proper motion calculation, we confirmed the energy source of the bipolar outflow of HH 896.","Astrometry; Bipolar outflow; E-Science; Virtual observatory",,"Sung, H.-I.; Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, Daejeon 305-348, South Korea; email: hisung@kasi.re.kr",,,03744884,,,,"English","J.

The WIMP has been considered a major part of non-baryonic dark matter located in galactic halo. Already, many experimental studies have searched for WIMPs in the last two decades. The same as other particle physics experiemnts, the direct detection methods searching for the WIMP provides many signals and backgrounds. We estimate our liquid or solid detectors to provide at least 10 -2/kg/day and up tp 10 12 background signal a day with a direct detection method. To handle those data, we need to establish a data-finding algorithm based on e-science. Our signal finding and data analysis algorithm will help to discriminate signals from background, to determine the signal amplitude, and to transfer the created huge date to other computing systems. We have developed a data-finding algorithm, the so-called computer aided significant signal detection (CASSD), that is based on the concept of a moving avrage (MA) and the more advanced concept auto regressive moving average (ARMA) and auto regressive indifference moving averag (ARiMA).

Design/methodology/approaches: Proceeding to examine the current state of East Asian collection in the USA and their transformation, this study offers insight on the larger trends in research libraries and strategies used to cope with change. A case study of the C.V. Starr East Asian Library of University of California, Berkeley illustrates concisely particular measures and solutions. Findings and implications: At present the greatest challenge facing research collections, including East Asian collections, is the move from a print tradition to a digital and networked future. The shift is profound: Mass digitization, Web 2.0, Library 2.0, and global information networks have already changed the ways research libraries operate, and these ways are multiplying constantly with the adoption of new strategic directions, including resource aggregation on the open web, creating e-science and e-humanities enterprises, keeping a healthy balance between cyber infrastructure and in-house print collections, and collaborating with the commercial sector to create and integrate scholarly resources. Originality/value: By looking at both the microcosm of East Asian libraries and the macrocosm of large research libraries and their transition, this study demonstrates that as new discovery tools are being adopted and new services offered, research libraries must find new ways to maintain their core values through innovation while moving swiftly in new directions. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Digital libraries; Library management; Organizational change; Research libraries; United States of America",,"Zhou, P.

The successful and sustainable operation of such grid infrastructures is only possible through the use of monitoring tools. The underlying networks upon which grid infrastructures are built are critical to their operation; therefore, network monitoring becomes an important part of the overall grid monitoring strategy. In this paper, the design and implementation of a set of tools for providing access to federated network monitoring data are presented, based on standards developed within the Open Grid Forum Network Measurements Working Group (NM-WG).

Omega C/Jordi Girona 1-3, 08034 Barcelona, Spain","Grid computing originated as paradigm for high performance computing and massive parallel processing. Currently, Grid systems have become an important paradigm for efficiently solving large scale complex problems from many fields. On the other hand, P2P paradigm originated from file sharing but each time more is being used for the development of large scale distributed platforms. Grid and P2P systems have thus followed different trajectories pushed by different motivations, needs and research communities. Yet, both paradigms are evolving in a way that each time more they are sharing common characteristics and are mutually benefiting from their best features. Among these characteristics, we could distinguish the cooperative model for solving complex problems by exploiting the large computing capacity offered by the nodes of the system altogether. As such, Grid and P2P systems have achieved notable success, in particular, for e-Science applications, a family of complex applications arising in science and engineering that need considerable computation power. Despite of important advances in the design and use of Grid and P2P systems, they remain still difficult to implement and apply to real life problems. The main difficulties reside in the lack of easy-to-use middleware for Grid and P2P, in the complexities of setting up and in the tedious task of deploying real world Grid/P2P platforms as well as in experimental studies which are often complex and not easy to repeat. In this chapter we survey and analyze the advances in communication libraries and middleware for both Grid and P2P systems as well as their limitations when used in real Grid and P2P infrastructures. We also bring examples of real life applications based on regularly sequenced data that can be efficiently handled through Grid and P2P approaches. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

The network carries data belonging to these high priority applications as well as that of applications such as e-mail and file transfer protocol, which are of lower priority. The optical network is reconfigured in order to optimise the network performance, and lightpaths are setup and torn down based on the traffic flow. The lightpaths of high priority applications must not be disrupted during reconfiguration. Therefore, an algorithm is proposed for reconfiguration of an optical network, in which lightpaths are setup between node pairs carrying traffic belonging to high priority applications, on a priority basis and are not disrupted during the entire session. Simulation results show that using the proposed algorithm, the value of average weighted hop count (AWHC) is maintained at approximately one for high priority applications.

Science is the search for truth in the outer world, about the body and the environment in which we live, while religion is the search for truth in the innermost world of man, mostly the world of mind, soul and sprit. Science discovers the properties and functions of Nature and Matter whereas religion asks and tries to answer questions regarding the purpose of life, its existence etc. in relation to the individual, society and the universe at large. Thus, briefly, science is an inquiry into the outer world to find the nature and function of every thing related to all worldly phenomenon. Religion on the other hand is an inquiry into the invisible inner world with a lot of emphasis on the purpose of creation, the meaning of life, value-system etc. For example science may discover the properties of electricity or nuclear power but what to do with that power and how and for what purpose it will serve the man and society will be determined by a religion approach and not by science in general. In spite of so much development and progress in science, why have we lost our happiness? Why everybody is full of tension and stress? Why our life has been so unsafe and full of risk? Why science has become a ruler rather then a servant? These are some questions, which jerk violently to the mind of every sensible person. Today there is a need of synthesizing the two apparently divergent fields of knowledge as science and religion with the value of a spiritual approach to life. There is a need in the life to bring a harmony, a synthesis, between the majesty of scientific thinking and the beauty of a value system, which will be for the benefit of an individual and the society and nations at large, and ultimately for the humanity. Einstein often used to say that-""Religion without science is lame and science without Religion is blind. In order to be a complete, fulfilled and purposeful human being covering all the aspects and dimensions of life we have to lead an integrated life combining science and religion in the most harmonious blending for the ultimate benefit of society and mankind."" In the ancient period India was known for super knowledge and prosperity. Its main cause was that there was an integration in between the two branches of knowledge i.e. science and religion. They were so merged together that non can isolate them and their separate existence was not possible. In our country, the Vedas, of which Upanishads are parts, also contain a lot of branches of Science like mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry etc. In fact even biological science like study of herbal medicine and surgery were also developed very well and codified in the Mantras of the Vedas, especially in the Atharva Veda. The Vedas described knowledge as being of two types-the Para and the Apara. The former pertaining to spiritual science and latter to material or secular sciences. The Rishis had realized that collaboration and cooperation between these two branches of human knowledge are essential for the holistic growth of man. Perhaps, this is one reason why the Vedas are considered as the ocean of knowledge pertaining to all kinds of thought, processes and phenomenon in life. The knowledge contained in the Vedas is considered infinite and unlimited for the eternity. According to Pope John Pal II-""Science can purify religion from error and superstition while religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes, Each can draw the other into a wider world, a world in which both can flourish....."". © Common Ground.","Development; Humanity; Progress; Religion; Science; Truth",,"Srivastav, P.K.; Banaras Hindu University, Uttar Pradesh, India",,"Common Ground Research Networks",18331882,,,,"English","Int.

Music teachers from the USA obtained higher attitude ratings towards the use of music integration, while music teachers in Japan integrated music with other subjects to a lesser extent. Teachers in both countries were most likely to integrate music with reading, language, science and math. History and social science integration with music was the least common area of integration among Japanese music teachers, while among American music teachers the practice of integrating music into history and social science content was more common.

Leisure activities such as computer games are an example of this. Using L-Systems (an automaton designed by Aristid Lindenmayer in 1968 to model cell development), students learn about the fractal nature of the natural world, introducing themselves to programming and to the new paradigm of e-Science; a collaborative and computational way to perform scientific activity. Creating these Alife worlds, students are introduced to virtual instruments and can also create hypertextual research strategies (working together with distant students from other places or countries).

This demonstrates that the concept of the Grid is more than merely a marketing phrase, but instead an enabler for new application domains in parallel and distributed computing. Among others, the EU project EGEE (""Enabling Grids for E-Science"") is probably the worlds largest initiative for establishing a permanent Grid infrastructure on a 247 basis. Such a Grid that is always on and there to serve the community just like the ubiquitous networking infrastructures today is on the horizon, waiting for users to utilise it in their applications. This paper explores the different possibilities for utilising Grids in parallel applications, focusing on different parallel computing aspects as provided by Grid environments. Basic concepts such as using the Grid as a large data storage and management basis or as a collection of distributed supercomputers represent a new approach to computational science, where users are expecting to utilise unprecedented amounts of performance for tackling their scientific problems.","Environments; Grid; Infrastructures; Parallel computing","Data storage equipment; Information management; Large scale systems; Parallel processing systems; Supercomputers; Ubiquitous computing; Grid environments; Ubiquitous networking; Grid computing","Praxmarer, P.; GUP-Institute of Graphics and Parallel Processing, Altenbergerstr. 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria; email: praxmarer@gup.jku.at",,,17445760,,,,"English","Int.

On the one hand, there is a desire to give remote participants the same views and capabilities that they would have as local participants. On the other hand, there are settings where experimental specimens and apparatus are large and difficult to manipulate effectively or view from a remote vantage point. This article argues for more novel forms of remote participation by drawing on exploratory interview and observation data gathered in civil engineering laboratories. It is shown that, while experiments are in progress, the engineers studied focus primarily on detecting and preventing specimen failures, and that their unease about remote participation stems from doubts about the ability of remote participants to detect failures adequately. It is argued that this presents the opportunity to consider novel roles for remote participants that exploit the features of e-science technologies. © 2007 International Communication Association.",,"Laboratories; Cyber infrastructures; E-sciences; Engineering laboratories; Experimental research; Experimental specimens; Observation data; Remote participation; Remote users; Earthquake engineering","Birnholtz, J.P.; University of Toronto, Canada",,"Wiley Blackwell",10836101,,,,"English","J.

A global service management system in such context is required to achieve efficient resource sharing and collaborative service provisioning. This paper presents VEGA system software, a novel grid platform that combines experiences from operating system design and current IP networks. VEGA is distinguished by its two design principles: a) ease of use. By service virtualization, VEGA provides users such a location-independent way to access services that grid applications could transparently benefit from systematic load balancing and error recovery, b) ease of deployment. The architecture of VEGA is fully decentralized without sacrificing efficiency, thanks to the mechanism of resource routing. The concept of grid adapters is developed to make joining and accessing the Grid a 'plug-and-play' process. VEGA has been implemented on Web Service platforms and all its components are OGSI-compliant services. To evaluate the overhead and performance of VEGA, we conducted experiments of two categories of benchmark set in a real size Grid environment. The results have shown that VEGA provides an efficient service discovery and selection framework with a reasonable overhead. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2004.",,"Benchmarking; Computer operating systems; Computer software; Distributed computer systems; Network management; Quality of service; Systems analysis; Collaborative services; Distributed computing technology; Grid applications; Location independent; Operating system design; Selection framework; Service platforms; Service virtualization; Web services","Sun, Y.; Institute of Computing Technology, , Beijing 100080, China; email: yuzhongsun@ict.ac.cn","Jin H.Chen H.Gao G.R.Xu Z.","Springer Verlag",03029743,3540233881; 9783540233886,,,"English","Lect.

The systematic utilization of healthcare records and research study recordings in an inter-linked manner provides a better enabling environment to improve evidence.

The base pair sequences of these DNAs are known (Dickson e^. Science 182, 65, 1977). These DNAs contain the 40-50 bp. promoter sequence which is bound by RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. Comparison was made to experimental melting curves of the transitions in 0. 1M Na+ solution. The theory included the effects of DNA length on final dissociation. Values of theoretical parameters were obtained from previous theory-experiment comparisons of natural and synthetic DNAs. Except for 6, the dissociation constant for final dissociation to single strands a single set of parameters was used. As expected B varied with the length of the fragment. Theoretical calculations produced agreement with the fine structure and T^ values of experimental curves which was within experimental error. Melting profiles calculated at temperatures within the transition inducated the DNAs melt from the ends with blocks of instability from 10 to 60 bp. long. The theory was also employed to examine the probability of base pair opening within the lactose promoter at temperatures below the helix-coil transition region. At 37°C the fluctuational opening of base pairs depends very little on its sequence environment. The average probability of opening, 0, is 3.5 x 10” for A*T bps. and 6.9 x 10”^ for G*C bps. As one approaches the transition, the influence of the sequence environment Increases. At 77°C, the average 0 values increase by 10 fold from 37°C. However the range of 9 for A*T pairs varies up to 200% compared to 6% for the same sequence at 37°C. © 1980, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
