Abstract;Ref
Open innovation is relatively a new category in organizations. Organizations are encouraged to share their R&D infrastructure in open innovation approach and attach other’s R&D and innovation to their own value chain through creating technical platforms or joint ventures. Social media is one of the tools of communication in the current business world. Social media creates a platform for cooperating and encouraging people for social activities. Considering the expanded role of social media in encouraging participation and gaining external knowledge in an organization, research is missing in this relationship. Papers dealing with social media and open innovation are really limited. So, in the current research, we study the results of using social media in open innovation. As there are limited researches, it is difficult to base a research project on available studies. So we study this area by deductive approach, Delphi method. In order to do so, we collected ideas of 12 experts from fintech industry and prioritized and analyzed them with the Delphi method and finally reached to 16 opportunities and 21 challenges. From experts' point of view, the most important opportunities are increasing the number and quality of received ideas. The most important challenges are creating new methods for receiving ideas to decrease unrelated content and information validation, and legislation. Finally we categorized the opportunities and challenges and presented them as a framework and model. © 2021 J. Adv. Inf. Technol. © 2021 by the authors.;Ref001
This investigation was carried out on the adoption of the e-money payment model with the application of a quantitative and qualitative approach (mixed methods). Online questionnaires, which included closed-ended questions on a Likert five-point scale and open-ended questions, were distributed through social media chat groups. Respondent samples were drawn from the population of adolescent customers in Indonesia. The collected questionnaires were verified for accuracy, reliability, and validity before the data were analyzed. Adequate data were used to test the relationship model between latent variables, and the relationship of latent variables in the model was tested using partial least squares by employing Smart-PLS 3.0 software and NVIVO 12 plus. The final analysis shows that the reasons for adopting e-money are practicality and convenience. The main reasons that customers adopt electronic money are its practicality, ease of use, efficient transaction time, faster payment, and the simplicity of the payment process. The final modeling formed good-fit inner and outer models. This model verifies the significant influence of social factors, effort expectancy, and facilitation conditions on e-money attitudes. Additionally, social factors, effort expectancy, and attitudes have a significant influence on e-money behavior. © 2020 by the authors.;Ref002
Efforts to use social media as a network tool for open innovations have not met expectations, or utilized its potential adequately. Recent research on identifying firms’ social media skill has not addressed the complex underlying mechanisms and calibration of social media capabilities. We explore how, why, and which resources an organization should integrate. Social media in NPD should be accompanied by carefully aligned R&D – marketing cooperation. Alignment results in efficient knowledge integration, but dis-alignment fails to tap enough ideas, or can lack information processing capacity. The alignment and disalignment hypotheses are tested using survey data of a sample of 101 innovative SMEs. In a second, configurational study we extend findings from Study 1 to determine micro level social media capabilities required. Results show that social media can be used for both radical and incremental innovation, but are more useful for service than for product innovation. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.;Ref003
This research focuses on how the tourism and hospitality industry is applying the paradigm of open innovation, supported by social media. Open innovation (OI) has been on the topical research agenda, but the previous literature lacks studies in the service sector and specifically for tourism companies. Moreover, the introduction of social media as a tool to implement open innovation is considered the main research gap. Structural equation modelling is applied to data from 181 Portuguese and Spanish companies to study both customer involvement in new product development and the perceptions and results in terms of turnover and competitiveness. The structure of the relationships between research and development, external openness and open innovation management is highlighted with statistical analysis. In addition, the introduction of social media adds value to the proposed model. Currently, there is a lack of available models to give structure to the OI paradigm and to allow us to manage it. The contribution of this research is a comparison of the explanatory power of three models that allow us to test how certain strategic guidelines in tourism companies influence each other and have a mediating or multiplier effect when linked to each other (nested models method). In conclusion, the originality of this research is based on the relationship between open innovation management and social media and the mediating effect of external openness. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.;Ref004
"Drawing upon the knowledge-based view, this study divides firm knowledge-processing capability (KPC) into market and technical knowledge-processing capabilities, and examines the moderating effect of social media use and two knowledge-processing capabilities on customer participation (CP) in new product development (NPD). The results show that social media use enhances the effect of customer participation on NPD performance (product innovativeness, market performance, and financial performance); firms’ two key capabilities (market knowledge-processing capability and technical knowledge-processing capability) further strengthen the moderating effect of social media use. Furthermore, the effect of customer participation on product innovativeness follows an inverted U-shape. This study not only confirms the crucial role of social media use and firm capabilities in customer participation in NPD but also provides firms with theoretical direction for how to use social media. © 2020, © KOSIME, ASIALICS, STEPI 2020.";Ref005
Retail firms are increasingly using social media for purposes other than traditional marketing, such as innovation. Yet, while the innovation literature has established the benefits of involving customers in the development of products/services through open innovation, the role of social media in innovation is not well understood. Accordingly, we investigate how social media drives innovation in retail businesses. Using data from 414 firms, we find that social media positively relates to radical and incremental innovation, mediated by multiple digital channels and moderated by digital capabilities. Consequently, we propose a social media dynamic capabilities framework to guide future research and innovation in retail business. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;Ref006
Innovation is a concept that has received much attention in recent years. Innovation is one of the critical factors for organisational success and competitiveness. In Malaysia, innovative behaviour is still at the infancy stage, especially among SMEs. The innovation rate in Malaysia is also not reaching full potential yet. Although industrial revolution 4.0 is gaining popularity, SMEs remain relatively unaware of the importance of innovation. Therefore, a quantitative study will be conducted among Malaysian SMEs on how to improve innovation performance. The social media and entrepreneurial orientation are the enablers of innovation performance proposed in the present study. Social media is a tool used to interact with customers to acquire useful information in the development stage. Moreover, with the entrepreneurial orientation possessed by the organisation, it can lead the organisation toward innovation. Besides the two enablers of innovation performance, open innovation is also proposed as a mediator. Open innovation allows the organisation to explore outside knowledge and exploit internal resources to stay competitive. As such, open innovation is mediating social media and entrepreneurial orientation toward a better innovation performance among Malaysian SMEs in the era of industrial revolution 4.0. The present study also added knowledge to the theory of the knowledge-based view. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.;Ref007
Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how communication practices influence individuals’ team assembly and performance in open innovation contests. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed behavioral trace data of 4,651 teams and 19,317 participants from a leading open innovation platform, Kaggle. The analyses applied weighted least squares regression and weighted mediation analysis. Findings: Sharing online profiles positively relates to a person’s performance and likelihood of becoming a leader in open innovation teams. Team assembly effectiveness (one’s ability to team up with high-performing teammates) mediates the relationship between online profile sharing and performance. Moreover, sharing personal websites has a stronger positive effect on performance and likelihood of becoming a team leader, compared to sharing links to professional social networking sites (e.g. LinkedIn). Research limitations/implications: As team collaboration becomes increasingly common in open innovation, participants’ sharing of their online profiles becomes an important variable predicting their success. This study extends prior research on virtual team collaboration by highlighting the role of communication practices that occur in the team pre-assembly stage, as an antecedent of team assembly. It also addresses a long-standing debate about the credibility of information online by showing that a narrative-based online profile format (e.g. a personal website) can be more powerful than a standardized format (e.g. LinkedIn). Practical implications: Open innovation organizers should encourage online profile sharing among participants to facilitate effective team assembly in order to improve innovation outcomes. Originality/value: The current study highlights the importance of team assembly in open innovation, especially the role of sharing online profiles in this process. It connects two areas of research that are previously distant, one on team assembly and one on online profile sharing. It also adds new empirical evidence to the discussion about online information credibility. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Ref008
Car-hailing platform governance is an emerging topic of research and practice. The governance of the data-driven platform economy is challenging the research paradigm of competition regulation in the context of open innovation. This research is trying to reveal the market allocation structure of China's online car-hailing industry from the perspective of personal data allocation by the study of Application Programming Interface (API) of sample platforms. On the basis of the networked nature of personal data allocation via APIs, this research constructs a mathematical model of the edge weight of data resource connections between platforms. Furthermore, this research optimises the structural hole analysis of complex networks to discuss the state of personal data resource allocation in China's car-hailing industry. Results reveal that there are obvious structural holes within the sample network. When compared with related indicators, we found that accessing personal data resources is an essential component of the sample network competition capability and sustainable innovation. Social media platforms and online payment platforms more greatly impact car-hailing platform competition than other types of platforms within the multi-sided market context. This research offers a research perspective of personal data allocation for further study of competition, regulation and sustainable innovation of data-driven platform economies. © 2019 by the authors.;Ref009
"Firms are increasingly leveraging social media tools to access knowledge from external actors, particularly customers and other users, to facilitate the innovation process and firm performance. Yet empirical research investigating the impact of external knowledge sourced via social media tools is scant; empirical studies that do exist are mixed, leading to calls for research into the conditions under which knowledge flows via social media from external actors contribute to innovation and firm performance. Using a large-scale survey of firms in Tasmania, Australia, this study examines how external knowledge flows from market-based actors sourced by social media influence innovation and business performance, and the extent to which modern human resource management (HRM)practices moderate this relationship. We find that while knowledge flows from market-based actors are positively related to innovativeness, the relationship between external knowledge flows via social media and innovativeness depends on the importance a firm places on modern HRM practices: a significant positive relationship exists between knowledge sourced via social media and innovativeness when firms attach high importance to modern HRM practices. In contrast, there is no significant relationship in firms in which modern HRM practices are of low importance. The study also shows that social media serves as a mediator for the effect of external knowledge flows on firm innovativeness when firms attach high importance to modern HRM practices. Furthermore, while the results demonstrate that innovativeness and firm performance are positively related, innovativeness does not translate into improved firm performance in firms that attach low importance to modern HRM practices. Taken together, the findings underscore the importance of modern HRM practices to enable knowledge inflows via social media to influence innovativeness, and innovativeness to translate into productivity benefits. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.";Ref010
Social media are privileged vehicles to generate rich data created with unprecedented multi-faceted insights to drive faster ideation and commercialisation of client-centric innovations. The essence of data generated through social media is rooted in the connections and relationships it enables between firms and their stakeholders, and represents one of the greatest assets for data-driven innovation. As most of the firms are still experiencing and trailblazing in this matter, the current challenge is therefore to learn how to benefit from social media's potential for innovation purposes. In the last decade, research interest has increased towards understanding social media – innovation interactions. The reliance on the wisdom of the crowd in driving major business decisions and shaping society's way of life is now well acknowledged in academic and business literature. Social media is increasingly used as a tool to manage knowledge flows within and across organisation boundaries in the process of innovation. Yet, conceptualisation of social media and innovation interaction and a systematic review of how far the field has come remains providential. Therefore, through a systematic literature review we aim to identify research trends and gaps in the field, conceptualise current paradigmatic views and therein provide clear propositions to guide future research. Based on a systematic review, 111 articles published in peer-reviewed journals and found in EBSCO Host® and Scopus® databases are descriptively analysed, with results synthesized across current research trends. Findings suggest social media is seen as enabler and driver of innovation, with behavioural and resource based perspectives being the most popular theoretical lens used by researchers. The originality of the paper is rooted in the comprehensive search and systematic review of studies in the discourse, which have not been unified to date. Implications for advancement of knowledge are embedded in the purposefully proposed theoretical, contextual and methodological perspectives, providing future research directions for exploring social media capability in innovation management. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;Ref011
Social media are essentially changing the way firms communicate, create and collaborate in and for innovation. In this special issue introductory article, we take stock of the robust multi-faceted nature of research and practice at the intersection of social media (SM) and innovation. We introduce the nine papers included in this special issue and highlight the rich variety of their contribution with reference to our organising framework. Diagnosing from a strategic perspective, we position SM strategy in and for innovation as an overlapping interaction between dynamic capabilities (sensing, seizing, reconfiguration) and the level of stakeholder engagement (macro, meso, micro). We explain how each interaction holds distinctive synergy in an open and collaborative innovation process. This organising framework shows how the malleable nature of SM creates opportunities for firms to engage widely distributed knowledge sources, enhance innovation capabilities and empower internal human resources towards an open and collaborative culture. Yet, we warn that all is not as rosy as it seems and a purposeful and coherent strategy that delivers distinctive ‘co-ownership’ experiences is quintessential ingredient to realise profits from SM use in innovation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;Ref012
With firms' increasing use of social media platforms, such as online user innovation communities (OUICs), customers are actively participating in firm-sponsored innovation activity by posting and commenting on new ideas for improving the firms' products and services, or to develop new ones. While it has been suggested that OUICs promote user interactions, it is largely unclear how other users' feedback may stimulate a focal user's contribution to such OUICs. Drawing on a media usage theory, we identify multifaceted benefits from user feedback that are cognitive, integrative and affective in the archival comments received by a focal user, and examine their individual and joint impacts on the user's future contribution in terms of both ideating and commenting behavior. We conduct a longitudinal study by collecting a large-scale, quantitative data set from a leading OUIC between 2008 and 2015, which reveals novel findings on the nuanced role of user feedback on social media in stimulating innovation. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;Ref013
Purpose: This paper aims to present a framework to guide managerial action for social media (SM) strategies for innovation by exploring its constituent elements – the “what” (SM types), the “who” (stakeholders to be reached), the “for” (innovation types) and the “how” (innovation process stages), as well as the value, benefits and barriers. Design/methodology/approach: A comprehensive and critical review of literature at the intersection of SM and innovation guides the development of a typology of SM types and their use across innovation types and stages. Findings: SM type and use tend to differ across innovation processes. The authors identify four types of SM in use across four stages of innovation, supporting six types of innovation, influenced by five categories of barriers, benefits and stakeholders each. Research limitations/implications: The research provides an integrative set of building blocks to consider for developing further studies of SM and innovation. Practical implications: By highlighting the intertwined aspects of SM and innovation in an open and collaborative environment, the paper calls for development of an SM readiness organisational diagnosis. It empowers managers with a coherent framework of different elements they should take into consideration when defining their SM strategies for innovation. Originality/value: Research on SM adoption and the extent of its usage for innovation purposes is still at its infancy. Given the increasingly open and collaborative innovation settings, the authors draw managerial attention to the need of SM strategies for innovation activities and provide a coherent analytical framework to guide action for organisational diagnosis. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Ref014
"This study shows how the tourism sector is applying the new paradigm of open innovation (OI) supported by social media. We drew on a sample of 135 companies from the sector in the south of Portugal and Spain to perform a cluster analysis. Currently, OI is a challenge in tourism, and social media are a strategic tool. The main objective is to evaluate the impact of customer involvement in innovation performance. The results show positive impact of OI in new product development, moreover results derived in terms of turnover and competitiveness improve; however, it all depends on the innovation management model. Anyway, even today, formal adoption is still pending to achieve the desired outcomes but this research highlights how the sector is advancing in the direction of OI. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.";Ref015
To sustain in today's ever-changing and competitive landscape, firms must work within and outside of their organizations' boundaries. Open innovation (OI) strategies such as external technology acquisition (ETA), and external technology exploitation (ETE), can effectively improve the innovation performance of the organizations. Technologies like social media can help organizations to scout for appropriate technology, and source for ideas and knowledge from external sources to support their innovations. Moreover, digitalization can hasten business operations and enhance the innovation process of the firm. Focusing on open innovation (OI), this study takes an integrated approach towards investigating the impact of OI strategies, technology scouting through social media, and digitalization vision on innovation and firm performance. Data were drawn from 153 organizations in Malaysia, and the partial least squares (PLS) method was used to analyze data. The findings revealed that ETE, technology scouting through social media, and digitalization vision have a significant relationship with innovation performance. This, in turn, shows a positive relationship with firm performance. However, ETA does not have a significant relationship with innovation performance in the Malaysia context. This study extends the current literature on OI through the use of specific technology variables, such as technology scouting through social media and digitalization vision to support organizations' innovation. © 2019 by the authors.;Ref016
"Purpose: This paper aims to explore how social media can be used strategically for delivering the promises of open innovation and examines the types of structure that can foster the integration of these new tools with more classic top-down innovation approaches. Design/methodology/approach: A single case study of, ALPHA (pseudonym), a multinational company that combined an integrated strategy and the creation of a lean structure with the full potential of social media. Findings: To take on the challenges of energy transition, ALPHA has implemented a low-cost approach allowing it to harness the promises of open innovation. This combined the introduction of a lean structure, two social media platforms and processes that ensured the integration of open innovation activities with existing departments. Research limitations/implications: The research is based on a single case study. Further research should be conducted to establish the generalization of the results. Practical implications: This paper highlights the key success factors in making such a light approach successful, namely, controlling cost and disruption of open innovation; integration matters; leveraging complementarities with existing social media initiatives; and bottom-up adoption. Originality/value: The research provides a unique approach that can be practically implemented to leverage social media to deliver the promises of open innovation and offers an original way of integrating social media lead innovation and open innovation strategies with more classic R&D activities. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.";Ref017
Taking the knowledge-based view of the firm as its starting point, and acknowledging that knowledge can lie outside the firm, this research extends our understanding of how the growing social media trend can contribute to open innovation. It focuses specifically on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which tend to be resource constrained and might benefit particularly from leveraging social media platforms. The authors bring forward the notion that people flock to social media because they are motivated by a desire for social interaction. Indeed, the findings suggest that SMEs that put effort into connecting customers on social media – which the authors refer to as having a ‘social strategy’ – are likely to reap both customers’ involvement in innovation on social media and new knowledge of value for innovation. Examining differences between social media platforms used primarily for personal purposes and those used primarily for professional purposes, the authors find that a social strategy is more effective in the first category than in the second. This probably reflects differences in the social identities that people adopt on these two types of social media platforms. © 2018 British Academy of Management;Ref018
This paper aims to contribute to the debate on Open Innovation in the age of Big Data by shedding new light on the role that social networks can play as enabling platforms for tourists' involvement and sources for the creation and management of valuable knowledge assets. The huge amount of data generated on social media by tourists related to their travel experiences can be a valid source of open innovation. To achieve this aim, this paper presents evidence of a digital tourism experience, through a longitudinal case study of a destination in Apulia, a Southern European region. The findings of the study demonstrate how social Big Data could open up innovation processes that could be of support in defining sustainable tourism experiences in a destination. © 2018 by the authors.;Ref019
In the wake of new digital technologies, organizations rely increasingly on contributions by external actors to innovate or even to fulfill their core tasks, including strategy-making processes. These external actors may take the form of crowds, where actors are isolated and dispersed, or of communities, where these actors are related and self-identify as members of their communities. While we know that including new actors in strategy-making may lead to tensions, we know little about how these tensions differ when either crowds or communities are concerned. Investigating this question by analyzing open strategy-making initiatives conducted by two non-profit organizations (Creative Commons and Wikimedia), we find that tensions with communities may be resolved with increasing openness in strategy-making, while crowds are better compatible with more exclusive strategy-making practices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;Ref020
We suggest a Social Media Agency Robot that can be used for interactive communication between elderly people and the younger generation via existing Social Media. This robot system has been implemented on a cloud service and a single board computer embedded in a human-type robot, which is equipped with a microphone, camera, speaker, sensors, and network access function, so that elderly people can transmit and receive information by voice via Social Media without using smartphones. We employed LINE which is a proprietary application for instant communications on electronic devices such as smartphones. In LINE, we need to select a message destination address before sending messages. On the other hand, our developed robot is basically operated by voice due to realizing the simple user interface. Therefore, we suggested a message exchange learning-type destination estimation method that enables elderly people not to express a message destination address explicitly. We also designed the Social Media Agency Robot based on the service-oriented architecture that enables us easily to use open innovation such as external cloud-based services. We developed the prototype system including the message exchange learning-type destination estimation method. Then, we did an experiment to evaluate our prototype system at a house for the elderly with the care service and detached houses in the Nagasaki prefecture. We confirmed the effectiveness of the message destination estimation through the real message exchange experiment by the elderly. We also evaluated the usability of the prototype system through the interview with the experiment subject. © 2018 Information Processing Society of Japan.;Ref021
The Internet has dramatically changed everyone's access to information, knowledge and other people. In many fields, this has resulted in an opening up of business models, products, services and organizations. Examples include open academic publishing, open software and open innovation. Experts are increasingly aware that a significant amount of knowledge and experience exists outside of their companies and institutions, which used to be the exclusive creator, aggregator and curator of knowledge and the sole places of innovation. Institutions are responding by reducing their boundaries and are opening up to the outside. A particularly potent technology for engaging people and capturing their knowledge has been social media. However, theories of participation and participatory approaches to shaping the built environment greatly predate even the Internet. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for open and creative designing. A proven three-tier architecture, various theoretical levels of participation and an abstract view on social media tools have been used to develop an original, flexible, generative, “one size does not fit all” platform that can be used for the optimal collection of external information and knowledge. The platform allows for simple enhancement of in-house information systems (IS) with socially rich components. We are finding such a modular approach as very flexible for organizations that host the planning processes and that the application of social media technology creates very low barriers for the public to contribute. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;Ref022
Publishers will usually make decisions based on their experience and knowledge in book publishing. However, there are risks of losses as markets can be unpredictable. Now, with the availability of various online social platforms, “crowdsourcing” is being used by publishers and authors to gather new ideas and innovations. This article will analyze how the crowdsourcing platform is used by industry players to attract active participation from the public, especially in the title development process. Publishers or authors also need to understand which platform is appropriate and how to use the platforms as a marketing communication tool. The netnography approach will be used to gather and analyze the data related to the specific subject area of the study, including literature review and online observation. Based on our observations, platforms such Wattpad and Ilham Karangkraf are popular among Malaysian authors and publishers, and had been used to get crowd engagement as well as to communicate with readers. With it, sometimes a work that has many readers or followers will be published. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.;Ref023
"An important and frequently researched concept in the field of open innovation is the integration of lead users into the process for developing innovative product concepts. Social media has offered promising new possibilities for companies in terms of supporting lead user integration. This paper provides an overview of relevant aspects of lead user research, as well as the identification of lead users. Furthermore, we connect lead user theory with social media and discuss possible ways to identify lead users. Based on the conclusion that existing research does not yet sufficiently provide a detailed understanding on identifying lead users in social media, we conducted an empirical study to gain deeper insights in the social media habits of lead users; this involved a case study comprising 20 interviews. This study's findings present a rather ambivalent picture, concluding that identifying lead users via social media may work with some limitations. Social media can contribute complementary with established approaches like pyramiding to the identification of lead users, but it is not a standalone solution. It strongly depends on the content of the project and on the group of individuals where lead users should be originated. Based on these findings, we derive theoretical and managerial implications and show how companies can utilize social media in addition to established methods for identifying lead users. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of study limitations and recommendations for areas of further research. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.";Ref024
The concepts of open innovation and big data have been largely explored, but little research focused on the use of big data for open innovation activities. We explore how big data obtained by social media can be useful for open innovation activities in Television (TV) domain. Results demonstrate that the analysis of open data coming from social media data allows TV managers to identify the specific TV contents and Twitter elements, which are able to increase the social media traffic related to the show and gain insights for innovating the design of the TV show’s episodes or seasons. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.;Ref025
Despite rigorous empirical research exploring the changes in innovation dynamics triggered by Social Media Networks (SMNs), the benefits coming from the use of these digital platforms for knowledge search in innovative activities for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are still unexplored. Customers become the new trailblazers. Thus, by adopting a customer led innovation perspective, this paper seeks to measure the effect on return on investment (ROI) of the use of SMNs as external drivers for supporting internal innovation search processes. On the basis of the extant literature on information system and social network analysis, the research describes and evaluates the multidimensional activities interwoven into the open innovation process, driven by integrating the five constructs of structural dimension, relational behaviour, cognitive dimension, knowledge transfer, and legitimization into our hypothesised conceptual model. Empirical research was conducted via the Classification Regression Tree (CART) on a sample of 2548 SMEs belonging to the fashion industry and based in Italy and in the United Kingdom. This study is of importance to academics and practitioners due to the increasing significance taken on by the adoption of social media networks in the fashion industry to improve innovation search. Recommendations are made to fashion managers and social media experts to support the planning and development of new products and services. New contributions are offered to the innovation and knowledge management literature. In addition, theoretical implications and avenues for future research are also considered. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;Ref026
Innovation scholars have long recognized entrepreneurship is ‘imitative’, whereas the commercialization of novelty is ‘innovative’. Thus they are highly distinctive skill-sets. Entrepreneurship, first, involves optimizing market sentiment for pure profit sometimes to the point of catastrophe and even fraudulence in many markets. These include: payment protection insurance (PPI) to ‘flash crashes’, automotive emission ‘defeat devices’, corporate bribery settlements, social media ‘hacking’, ‘fake news’ and a litany of other infractions and catastrophes. Innovation, by contrast, is more explorative and team-reliant. Even if patenting betrays the hope for commercialization on markets, patented innovation frequently fails. Some academic innovators even profess a preference for prizes over profits. Second, this means that collective ‘bonding’ among entrepreneurs, in the form of claimed ‘entrepreneurial ecosystems’, is often based on a single customer platform or as a supplier of a highly specialist type of ‘imitative’ service from identikit pizza chains to ‘me-too’ smartphone apps. Through the latter, fused with artificial intelligence some interactive machine-learning services have long-existed as ‘postsocial’ algorithms serving customers of, for example, investment banks in stock and currency markets. Finally, entrepreneurship is fundamentally competitive, individualistic and non-solidaristic, whereas ‘open innovation’ was born from the practices of ‘open science’ and the collegiate tradition of research. Accordingly, ‘entrepreneurial ecosystems’ can display more closure than RIS set-ups. This special issue explores aspects of these ecosystem platforms and their implications for emergent forms of urban and regional evolution in the near and nearly present future. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Ref027
This article revisits the concept of the public sector innovation champion. Reflecting changes in sectoral and wider contexts and conceptual advances in the innovation literature, it suggests that much of the underlying thinking behind the original article is of continuing relevance and suggests a number of directions in which this could now be extended, particularly in terms of the nature of innovation and the role of champions therein. It concludes by considering how innovation champions of the future will require a new skillset which draws on new and emergent technologies to align diverse sets of stakeholders in networks of ‘open innovation’. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Ref028
Purpose: The exchange of knowledge in social networks is fundamental to innovation. Open, interactive, innovation requires collaboration through social networks. This social networking is increasingly carried out across the Internet through social media applications. The purpose of this study is to explore the use of social media in open innovation, and explain how this practice is carried out in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). With less resources than large firms, SMEs both have a greater need for open innovation and a less resources to invest in the process. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors study the case of open innovation in start-up Aurea Productiva and induce a framework for open innovation in SMEs powered by social media. Findings: The authors explore how the main advantages of the Web 2.0 translate into opportunities, challenges and strategies for open innovation that can be directly applied by managers. Research limitations/implications: The authors contribute to research on open innovation by social media and to research on the innovation process of SMEs. Future quantitative research could confirm and extend the authors’ findings. Practical implications: Companies that want to fully exploit the benefits of social media can create a strategy that emphasizes coevolution of innovation and resources, sharing their vision and objectives and providing a framework for innovation. Originality/value: The authors introduce an original analysis of opportunities, challenges and strategies for open innovation in SMEs. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Ref029
"Motivated by the multiple ‘success stories’ of the open innovation paradigm in the private sector, and also by the increasing complexity of social problems and needs, the public sector has started moving in this direction, attempting to exploit the extensive knowledge of citizens for the development of innovations in public policies and services. As the direct transfer of open innovation methods from the private sector to the public sector is not possible, it is necessary to develop effective ‘citizen-sourcing’ methods, which address the specific needs of the public sector, and then analyze and evaluate them from various political and management sciences' perspectives. This paper makes a two-fold contribution in this direction: i) It evaluates a novel method of monitoring relevant social media (e.g. political blogs, news websites, and also Facebook, Twitter, etc. accounts) by government agencies, by retrieving and making advanced processing of their content, and extracting from it external knowledge about specific domains of government activity or public policies of interest, in order to promote and support open innovation; ii) For this purpose it develops a multi-perspective evaluation framework, based on sound theoretical foundations from the political and management sciences, which can be of wide applicability; it includes three evaluation perspectives: a political perspective (based on the ‘wicked’ social problems theory from the political sciences), a crowd-sourcing perspective (based on previous management sciences research on crowd-sourcing) and a diffusion perspective (based on Roger's diffusion of innovation theory from management sciences). The above evaluation provides interesting insights into this novel method of promoting and supporting open innovation in the public sector through social media monitoring, revealing its capabilities and strengths, and at the same time its problems and weaknesses as well, and also ways/interventions for addressing the latter. © 2016";Ref030
This study seeks to address two research questions. First, how can citizen online communities support open innovation practices in the public sector? Second, what kinds of contributions are produced through social media platforms? These questions are examined through an experimental research setting and by analyzing interactions and contributions made in a neighborhood development–oriented Facebook group.

Government transparency and information disclosure have received increasing attention from both academics and practitioners with the development of information technologies (ITs) and the Internet. Moreover, the popularity of social media applications has provided governments, especially governments in China and other developing countries, with new opportunities and challenges associated with the administrative shift toward open innovation. The official document exchange via microblogging (ODEM) of the Haining Bureau of Justice is a practical case of government open innovation in the social media context. Based on the ODEM case, this study uses the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to explore the factors that drive open innovation in China. We find that the support of top managers, the access and competence of IT personnel, and the regional economic and social environments are key determinants of the emergence of open innovation in the public sector. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;Ref032
Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore and illustrate how organizations may use online communities strategically to adapt to a changing business environment, specifically from a dynamic capabilities perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The paper presents empirical evidence from three cases. Findings: Online communities may help organizations to adapt to a changing business environment by allowing them to sense opportunities and threats, seize opportunities and reconfigure organizational assets. Research limitations/implications: The paper contributes to both the strategy and the information systems literatures by providing empirical insights into the strategic use of online communities. Practical implications: The results of the paper are relevant for managers, helping them to understand the strategic role online communities (may) play and illustrating ways to use them accordingly. Originality/value: The paper addresses a previously defined gap in the literature and provides novel empirical evidence. As online communities become integral parts of digital strategy and open innovation initiatives, the paper is both timely and relevant. © 2017, © David Wagner, Matthias Wenzel, Heinz-Theo Wagner and Jochen Koch.;Ref033
This paper offers a review of the theory published on crowdsourcing tools from de point of view of the concept's adoption by researchers. Crowdsourcing is a concept that includes many of the online collaboration activities performed by crowds in response to an open call. The paper offers a perspective on the incremental amount of publications already available as an indicator of the level of such adoption, given that the adoption process in general takes time because there has to be a critical mass of ideas conformed by experts. This paper includes a review on the theoretical concepts related to crowdsourcing and technological adoption. Systematic search has been done and the obtained information is included. Finally some conclusions are delivered. © 2016 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge;Ref034
Sustainability and social media use in open innovation play important roles in a firm's new product development (NPD) process. This research examines, in conjunction, the roles of sustainability and social media driven inbound open innovation (SMOI) for a firm's NPD performance, and further, takes a more refined approach by differentiating between different types of SMOI activities. To this end, this research develops and tests a conceptual framework, which predicts that (1) a firm's sustainability orientation (SO) is positively associated with its NPD performance, (2) customer focus (CF) partially mediates the SO–NPD performance link, and (3) particular SMOI activities moderate the CF–NPD performance link. The empirical results, using data from the Product Development and Management Association (PDMA)'s comparative performance assessment study, provide support for most of the framework. Notably, this research documents a positive link between SO and NPD performance, as well as a partial mediating role of CF. The results further suggest that social media driven open innovation activities focused on gathering market insights enhance CF directly, while social media driven open innovation activities that garner technical expertise enhance the link between CF and NPD performance. This paper bridges the separate literatures on sustainability and open innovation, and contributes to the NPD research. The findings suggest that managers should take a strategic approach to sustainability and embed it in the NPD process. Furthermore, managers should manage social media based open innovation carefully to fully benefit the firm during the front end and back end of NPD. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association;Ref035
"As social media attract increasing attention from executives and find varied applications in different industries, research on the subject has been investigating the antecedents, moderators, mediators and outcomes of social media adoption, as well as impacts on the organizational and individual level. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the discussion of the new sources of social media innovation—i.e., the upstream originators of social media solutions. Such innovations of a possibly disruptive nature often originate from startups, which can constitute a significant driver for social media development and can influence the adopting incumbents’ behaviors. This study aims at shedding first light on social media-based solutions developed and delivered by startups. By surveying the Crunchbase database, we identified 724 funded social media startups, which were further classified into six categories, namely: (i) social network; (ii) social commerce; (iii) social recruitment; (iv) social management; (v) social loyalty and advocacy; (vi) contact management. Our findings show how the large majority of startups deliver social network solutions to incumbents, followed by social media management applications. The findings also shed light on emerging approaches to value generation and open innovation from social media related to and driven by startups. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd";Ref036
Social media (SM) allow users to easily create, edit, or share content. The vast numbers of individuals that converge around sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter embody a rich source of external knowledge that could be utilized for new product development (NPD). Complementing other channels for open innovation (OI), SM can provide access to novel information about customer needs and technological solutions unknown to the firm. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are considerable benefits from using SM during an innovation project, but empirical evidence is scarce. Contributing to the perspective of openness in search, a number of hypotheses propose how SM as a new channel for OI can contribute to firm performance. This model is tested using data from the PDMA Comparative Performance Assessment Study, identifying factors influencing the relationship between SM and NPD performance. The findings indicate that utilizing information from SM channels can lead to higher performance, but that this link is influenced by the formalization of a firm's NPD process. This study also finds that the ability of a firm to benefit from external search in SM strongly depends on complementary internal processes when organizing and conducting this activity. Furthermore, managers have to take care when utilizing information from SM channels in radical projects, as for this kind of project only a weak significant performance contribution of SM could be found. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association;Ref037
Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) typically face resource and capability constraints that inhibit their innovation activities. One way SMEs can overcome these constraints is by complementing internal resources and capabilities with external knowledge, referred to as open innovation. With the proliferation of the Internet, SMEs have added social media to their traditional marketing activities. However, they rarely embrace social media's analytical capabilities for innovation. The authors propose the semantic-learning-based innovation framework (SLBIF) to guide SMEs in using social media's analytical capabilities to innovate their products or services. Their framework includes three consecutive stages innovators should follow - idea selection, idea refinement, and idea diffusion - that explain how to analyze customer preferences through semantic analysis of customer posts and identify lead users and opinion leaders using user-directed social network analysis. © 1999-2012 IEEE.;Ref038
With increasing product personalization and open innovation, the manufacturing paradigm has been transforming to a more decentralized and socialized one. Social manufacturing was proposed as a new paradigm for industry. It extends the crowdsourcing idea to the manufacturing area. By establishing cyber-physical-social connection via decentralized social media, various communities can be formed as complex, dynamic autonomous systems to co-create customized and personalized products and services. This article presents the concept and characteristics of social manufacturing including distributed, adaptive, and self-organization. It also addresses social intelligence in proactive decision-making for organization of socialized resources and producers in the life-cycle of product. © IMechE 2015.;Ref039
Through a case study of using social media tools to open up part of the curatorial research process for an online exhibit on the history of astronomy at the Library of Congress, I offer some initial ideas about how an open approach to sharing curatorial research could significantly expand the impact and reach of such work. Drawing on three distinct emerging conceptions and frameworks for the idea of “open” (open notebook science, linked open data, and open innovation) I suggest how this case study can be used to guide work with existing simple and inexpensive tools and how it could also inform the development of future tools, services and exhibit development methods. This work builds on an ongoing discussion of open data in libraries, archives, and museums. To date, most of that dialog is about object records and not about the stories and narratives cultural heritage institutions tell about them. I suggest ways to make the production of cultural heritage data, as well as the final outputs, part of an open and transparent process. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;Ref040
Although many organizations have deployed social media tools to support business activities such as marketing or customer relationship management in the past several years, academic research on using social media for supporting innovation process is very limited. Many organizations find it challenging to effectively integrate social media into organizational innovation practices because social media are primarily complex, informal and episodic. In this research, we would like to explore how various organizational factors can contribute to social media use for supporting innovation process. We conducted a case study of two particular cases, one with an e-learning service unit at a public university and another with a large hotel chain company. Based on the findings of this case study, we proposed a process-based framework that could help organizations use social media to support innovation process. This case study also identified situational factors that could affect the use of social media for closed innovation and open innovation respectively. In addition, some useful guidelines and proven practices are revealed from this case study. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;Ref041
In the recent years, open innovation and co-creation concepts engaging customers in organizations have been gaining widespread attention around the globe. This is particularly significant in the telecommunication space, given the abundant benefits from economy of scale, ease of access to resources, shorter innovation cycles, supportive customer service and enhanced business processes. Thus, this research attempts to identify the factors that influence the adoption of open innovation and co-creation in Malaysian telecommunication industry. The current era imposes criticality for telecommunication companies (telcos) to solidify their collaborations and partnerships, innovation exchange and co-create with their customers using social media tools, in order to sustain and thrive in the industry. To achieve the purpose of the study, a preliminary investigation was conducted using qualitative approach and based on a number of semi-structured interviews, with participation from four staff of a selected telco in Malaysia. The findings highlighted six factors, namely cost control, partnership models, standard conformance, go-to-market strategy, flexible communication and knowledge exchange. Subsequently, these findings may be included in the process of developing a conceptual model for open innovation and co-creation with customers using social media platforms in Malaysian telecommunication industry. Ultimately, this study could contribute to the telecommunication industry in formulating, planning, executing and reviewing the telcos business strategy based upon open innovation and co-creation concepts. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers.

"Some governments have proven social media's potential to generate value through co-creation and citizen participation, and municipalities are increasingly using these tools in order to become smart cities. Nevertheless, few public administrations have taken full advantage of all the possibilities offered by social media and, as a consequence, there is a shortage of case studies published on this topic. By analyzing the case study of the platform Santander City Brain, managed by the City Council of Santander (Spain), the current work contributes to broaden the knowledge on ambitious social media projects implemented by local public administrations for e-Government; therefore, this case can be useful for other public sector's initiatives. The case studied herein proves that virtual social media are effective tools for civil society, as it is able to set the political agenda and influence the framing of political discourse; however, they should not be considered as the main channel for citizen participation. Among the results obtained, the authors have found that several elements are required: the determination and involvement of the government, a designated community manager to follow up with the community of users, the secured privacy of its users, and a technological platform that is easy to use. Additionally, the Public Private Partnership model provides several advantages to the project, such as opening new sources of funding. Copyright © 2016, IGI Global.";Ref043
"The dynamics of global business and knowledge-based economic paradigm has made ideas, thoughts, concepts and knowledge as the key capital of entrepreneurial business at this time. The need for the idea of the infinite and always renewable a major prerequisite for entrepreneurs and creative SMEs in order to survive. Knowledge is an asset as well as ""ammunition"" to create a new creative product. Synergy of internal knowledge agencies with external agencies in line with the spirit of open innovation, i.e., synergy that would enable SMEs to have backward linkage relationship with suppliers and forward linkage with consumers that will eventually culminate in the formation of a new creative market. In line with the spirit of open innovation, a search for Creative Social Media (CSM) Model has become a strategic issue in the current economic paradigm. CSM is a social networking system that is essential in its capacity as a repository and knowledge intermediation for entrepreneurs. Knowledge recommender system will be the main engine of the CSM system used to provide recommendations in the context of sharing knowledge reference between entrepreneurs in a same cluster and in the spirit of anti plagiarism design as ethical boundaries. On the other hand, CSM also played as a tool to win a battle of creativity among entrepreneur's entities in the the world without boundaries. Thus, CSM plays the role of encouraging the growth of the creative city network around the world, facilitated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

Relationship marketing principles shifted with the emergence of the social Web. The firm-centric, traditional closed doors approach is no longer assuring the survival in a global market with demanding and informed customers. Customer touch points are replaced by an open mentality where customer experience and creative collaboration with prosumers has changed even CRM techniques. The present paper analyses the journey from traditional CRM, to social CRM and PoRM (Prosumer-oriented Relationship Management) in response to consumer creative engagement desires. Thus, four PoRM processes are conceptualized by taking into consideration the necessities for prosumer management: the creation of a community, creativity enablement for open innovation, knowledge management and communication channels. In the end general functional blocks with several patterns are presented for efficient services and innovative ideas. This research constitutes one of the first steps into the conceptualization and explanation of the PoRM theory with implications in the design of future relationship management technologies.

"Purpose: This paper aims to examine the dynamics of a community of practice (CoP) through a case study of eCars – Now! They offer open-source blueprints of the electric conversion kits globally. The authors analysed the CoP by considering its entire life cycle, starting from the motives for its establishment, through its active performance, up to the current stage, where the members need to decide whether the community will remain viable. Particular attention was paid to the group dynamics and issues that seemed relevant to the change in dynamics which determine whether a CoP maintains its vitality or dissipates. Design/methodology/approach: The qualitative case study was chosen as the research strategy (Yin, 1984) to answer the research question and understand the target phenomenon of the CoP by analysing textual data. This particular case was chosen because of its unusual revelatory value for the case CoP which aims at creating a tangible innovation by using a platform that normally aims at intangible problem-solving (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). In the data collection, the authors used method and researcher triangulation (Patton, 1990). Findings: Life cycle analysis revealed four themes that explained the change in the group dynamics and the dispersal of the community: differentiation and dispersal of interests, growth that resulted in role differentiation, virtuality in community development and inclusion of investors. The themes were all related to the fact that the case community operated with not only knowledge, but also with a tangible product. Therefore, the tangibility of a problem to be solved seems to play a pivotal role in a CoP’s operations and dynamics and, in part, also explains the changing role of information and communications technology (ICT) in the process. Research limitations/implications: However, this paper identified also different ways to characterize community participation, which was also relevant from group dynamics point of view. Thus, the topic should be studied further. Group dynamics in general, as it relates to the success of CoPs, should be also investigated further. Additional studies should implement the inclusion of external resources in the community. Further research is also needed to investigate tangible and intangible outcomes achieved through CoPs. Much of the available research was conducted over short periods; prolonged interactions in a CoP context could show different results. Practical implications: In conclusion, at the beginning of the life cycle of the eCars community, ICT played a significant role. It helped increase awareness of the community in the first place and enabled people to join in, which thus enabled the community to evolve. When the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became emphasized and much more important. In the maturing stage, the role of ICT, and especially social media, is the essential part of the community. Social implications: This analysis suggests that at the early stage of a community, the plans can be somewhat random, even utopian, but when the community evolves, this uncertainty can become a problem. First, it affects achieving the actual, and in this case, concrete results. Second, uncertainty and unclarity dampen enthusiasm and motivation, which are of utmost importance due to the voluntary participation. This paper also concludes that when the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became increasingly important. Originality/value: This paper argues that the ideological basis for this kind of community should be openness. All information should be available for everyone who registers to the community platform on the internet. This community was working in the mindset of open innovation. Technical documentation and all other material were available for everyone in the community’s wiki pages, which attracted a lot of people who were delighted by eCars. Many advisors delivered technical information and good advice to the practitioners of the community through the platform. The hang arounds were also very well-informed in this stage regarding how the core group was working. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";Ref046
"This study highlights the contribution of the role of social media in supporting customer involvement for service innovation. It is commonplace that many service firms and processes have characteristics that differ from manufacturing. Analyzing the literature, we note that there are many contributions on innovation in the manufacturing industry while few researches are concentrated on the service industry. Hence, we chose to deepen the analysis on marketing innovation, with specific reference to the involvement of the customer, through social media, in service firms. One of the key aspects of many service activities is the high involvement of the client/customer/user in the production of the final service. Without this coproduction process (i.e. interactivity of service production), the service would have often not been created. This customer involvement, together with the intangibility of many service products, leads service innovation to assume characteristics that are different from those learned by studies on manufacturing innovation. Service innovation is hard to capture in traditional categories like product or process innovation: the coproduction process and the interactions between the service provider and his client originate from so many touch points that it becomes difficult to identify what is the focus of innovation in service firms. Hence, the focus is on the role of innovation in marketing activities in favoring the customer's involvement in the service creation process through web tools, stimulating a closer relationship between the firm and its customers. The study develops into the following steps: we start from the objectives and the definition of the research question through the study of the literature; we try to find some assumptions that can be useful to analyze the selected case studies. Results help us to discuss the analysis and to get to some conclusions. © 2015 Della Corte et al.";Ref047
This study investigates the effects of the use of social media in inbound open innovation on capabilities for absorptive capacity of companies. Seven explorative case studies were conducted in an R&D and business context of two large global high-tech companies. The results suggest that if the necessary conditions are met, social media usage increases the transparent, moderational and multi-directional interactions that in turn influence four capabilities for absorptive capacity: connectedness, socialization tactics, cross-functionality and receptivity, a hitherto overlooked capability. Hence, we observe that social media are boundary-spanning tools that can be used to build and increase companies' absorptive capacity. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;Ref048
"Purpose – The internal resources of a firm should not be regarded as the only source of innovation; organizations need to look at the external sources which can contribute greatly. This can happen through the recent development in technologies and the emergence of social media; such advancements have empowered consumers to have social interaction with their peers in online communities. As a source of generation of innovative ideas, company-based communities have not received enough attention, although they are strong drivers for co-creation of value by customers. Easy online communication channels, facilitated through online communities, have developed open innovation as an attractive means of customer involvement in value creation. However, literature in this area is devoid of empirical research on the way consumers can participate in open innovation communities using Web 2.0 technologies. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper, therefore, looks at the opportunities offered by social media to firms for open innovation in the context of new product development (NPD). The study is based on social support theory and the concept of social media generating open innovation; a model for the research has thus been proposed. The model has been tested using partial least square through an online questionnaire. Findings – The results indicate that social media is a cost-efficient way for firms to look at external sources of innovation, specifically in NPD. Online communities, developed specifically for new products, can support the innovation process for the business sector. The paper discusses the results of this empirical research and has some practical implications for practitioners in this field. Originality/value – The study indicate that social media empower individuals to come online, get involved in social interaction and share their experiences about a new product with other peers in the network. Social media and informational support, as social capital of online communities, both have influence on participation of individuals in the online communities of open innovation for NPD. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";Ref049
Abstract Social media technologies allow user-generated content and provide new opportunities and challenges for firms to transform their business. In particular, more and more firms have started strategically using the online user innovation communities (OUICs) for open innovation initiatives. The extent to which firms are able to derive business value from OUICs, however, has not been systematically examined. Drawing on a multi-theoretical foundation from the framework of dynamic capabilities and the view of innovation value chain, we conceptualize two OUIC-enabled capabilities, which are, ideation capability related to collecting user-generated ideas about potential innovation from OUIC, and implementation capability related to selecting user-generated ideas for innovation development and introducing developed innovation via OUIC. Using a large-scale panel data set consisting of 1676 firm-day observations from Dell and Starbucks, we examine the impacts of OUIC-enabled capabilities on firm value. We find robust evidence that OUIC-enabled ideation capability actually does not influence firm value, whereas OUIC-enabled implementation capability increases firm value. Novel theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.;Ref050
Development of information and telecommunication technologies (ICT) and growing popularity of the Internet as communication medium were the most important incentives having influenced the global knowledge-based economy for at least two decades. Although the ICT infrastructure development degree is still often considered as an information society measure, it seems that nowadays, when so many people has broadband and mobile access to the Web, more appropriate ones are those reflecting ICT skills and efficient Internet usage qualifications. One of the new concepts is “open innovation”, which in a wider sense could be understood as an exemplification of networked knowledge and innovation exchange method possible thanks to the contemporary Internet revolution. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate the general concept of open innovation environment, which could be created in Poland to facilitate and foster a scientific and innovation-oriented cooperation among different stakeholders, like companies (especially SMEs), universities, public institutions and the mass of individual Internet users. To achieve this goal, the latter part of the paper is dedicated to the electronic survey results analysis and discussion. This survey has been conducted via social media and other electronic communication channels in course of author’s research concerning new models of knowledge diffusion and technology transfer in electronic networks, especially on the Web. © 2014 Prague Development Center.;Ref051
Despite the exponential rise of social media use in external stakeholder engagement, academic research and managerial practice have paid little attention to how it can be used for open innovation across the entire innovation funnel, spanning ideation, R&D, and commercialization. As a result, there is little understanding of how companies can organize for and implement social media for open innovation. Utilizing a multiple case study design, this article examines its application across the entire innovation process. It proposes a range of organizational and technological adaptations that managers can implement to ensure they realize the innovative benefits of social media application. © 2014 by The Regents of the University of California.;Ref052
"In recent years the proliferation of a new technological evolution has aroused great interest from science and practice: social media. Subsuming different types of online applications where users can create, edit and share content, social media enables new forms of interaction with others. Organisations already recognise its relevance and start leveraging on it. Furthermore, organisations identify the role of service innovation as one major driver for economic growth and competitive advantage. Nevertheless, although social media affords organisations to interact with their customers, the potential for utilising it for improving their service innovation activities is almost unexploited yet. Therefore, this paper aims at providing a framework for supporting the use of social media affordances for service innovation. Its applicability is tested in the domain ""government"". Based on theoretical constructs a conceptual analysis is presented, tested in a specific domain and supplemented by potential future research and implications for theory and practice.";Ref053
This paper analyzes organizations' attempts to entice external contributors to submit suggestions for future organizational action. While earlier work has elaborated on the advantages of leveraging the knowledge of external contributors, our findings show that organizational attempts to attract such involvement are likely to wither and die. We develop arguments about what increases the likelihood of getting suggestions from externals in the future, namely through (1) proactive attention (submitting internally developed suggestions to externals to stimulate debate) and (2) reactive attention (paying attention to suggestions from externals to signal they are being listened to), particularly when those suggestions are submitted by newcomers. Findings from an analysis of about 24,000 initiatives by organizations to involve external contributors suggest these actions are crucial for receiving suggestions from external contributors. Our results are contingent upon the stage of the initiative because organizations' actions exert more influence in initiatives that lack a history of prior suggestions. Our work has implications for scholars of open innovation because it highlights the importance of considering failures as well successes: focusing exclusively on initiatives that reach a certain stage can lead to partial or erroneous conclusions about why some organizations engage external contributors while others fail. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;Ref054
"Organizational practices that foster a dialogic relationship between organizations and their constituent customers have created an arena for inbound and outbound innovation. At the nexus of this development occurring in the media industries, these flows are carried by various forms of digital, social media and an increasing digital presence in the form of dynamic websites with varying degrees of interactive capabilities. In this paper, we posit that the newspaper industry is torn between indifference and cautious apprehension caused by the difficulty in marrying the journalism profession’s carefully guarded gatekeeping practices with the revolving doors of open innovation. Gatekeeping has emerged as a fiercely defended cornerstone for the industry and the profession of journalism itself is not enough to distinguish amateurs from professionals; for the segregation between professionals and amateurs to carry weight rather than being reduced to a hollow title, the segregation needs a practice that explicitly enforces gatekeeping—where actions speak louder than titles. Against this backdrop, we pursue the following research question: Why has IT-enabled open innovation become such a contentious issue in the context of the newspaper industry? Combining contextual in-situ ethnographic interviews and observation with an industry-wide content analysis of Swedish newspaper websites, we present an in-depth view of what IT-enabled open innovation means in the context of the newspaper industry. Results show that the process of legitimization inscribed by a particularly charged information technology—the printing press—continues to exert great influence in what constitutes open practice in the newspaper industry. © 2014, Association for Information Systems.

As many futurists have argued, images of the future have a crucial role to play in societal development. At an individual level, the understanding of people’s hopes, fears and expectations becomes important not only to determine how we look at the future but also to understand our present actions. At a collective level, sharing these images and understanding our role within the community is also essential for the development of a shared vision about the future. Young people stand out as one of main players in this task of building the society of the future, which is why investigating their images of the future should have highly significant implications. The present paper shows the results of a comparative pilot study about the images of the future found among youngsters from 2 different European countries: Spain and Finland. The survey—which involved two groups of university students from the aforesaid countries—has as its main aim to look into the identified cultural values and message sources that can influence the way in which we look at the (expected and desired) future. The importance of this project, which was developed using the web platform www.F212.org—a pilot project funded by FECYT (Spanish initials for Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology)—stems from the idea that the communication and exchange of information about images of the future through social networks will empower new generations to cope with the challenge of building a desired future. © 2013, The Author(s).;Ref056
"Purpose - With the rise of social media, the practice of innovation management is changing rapidly as well. While the opening up of corporate innovation processes can be observed in literature as well as in practice (commonly known as ""Open Innovation""), we draw the reader's attention to the strategic potential of social media in innovation management. For this, a conceptual framework will be introduced. Design/methodology/approach - In this chapter, we compare established concepts of knowledge management to potentials of social media in this field, which offer more efficient and promising ways to integrate external knowledge into innovation processes. This approach is discussed by considering the integration of customers and especially Lead-Users into corporate product development. Based on the concept of Open Innovation, we reflect the role of Lead-Users in the innovation process critically. Mounting on our reflections, we show the potentials of social media for integrating Lead-Users and develop a conceptual framework for the integration of Lead-Users using different social media applications. Findings - In this paper, a conceptual framework for integrating Lead-Users by using different social media applications is developed and introduced. Originality/value - The unique conceptual framework derived in this chapter is enriched with a discussion of the challenges resulting from the implementation of Lead-User integration along with social media in corporate innovation management. The chapter can help companies as well as researchers to implement a process for the integration of Lead-Users by using the potentials of social media applications.

"Purpose: The ever changing needs of customers require companies to speed up the new product development process. Thus, the web and social media enable companies to interact and to share knowledge with customers, and to cocreate new products with them. The purpose of this study is to analyze the innovation outputs companies can achieve by involving customers at the ""fuzzy front end"" of the new product development (NPD) process. Design/methodology/approach: A case study method has been adopted because the phenomenon under investigation is new, it is hard to find similar researches, and the study attempts to increase researchers' understanding of such phenomenon. The case study method has enabled the exploration of the strategies used and the results achieved by an international food company, which has involved ordinary customers at early stages of its NPD process, namely at the idea generation and screening stages. Findings: The case study shows that customers freely provide valuable, original, new, and feasible ideas that can foster product and service innovation, and may also trigger process innovation. Thus, the case study shows how the company has outsourced to customers the idea generation and screening stages of the NPD. The case illustrates how the food company has used the ideas gathered from customers to develop new products and new services. Increasingly, it shows also how the company has gathered strategic information about consumers' needs and desires (marketing intelligence). Finally, this research discusses the importance of knowledge codification facilitators and of informal, peer-to-peer, and transparent communication as enablers of consumers' ideas sharing. Research limitations/implications: The single case study approach may prevent the generalization of results. Originality/value: In marketing and innovation research, there is a dearth of studies on how companies are involving customers through the web at early stages of their NPD process. In addition, there is a lack of in-depth discussion about the innovation outputs generated through cocreation activities. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.";Ref058

Governments are striving to deliver more efficient and effective public services in order to achieve better public service quality, with reduced waiting times, improved cost effectiveness, higher productivity and more transparency. It's an issue of doing things in new ways that re quire s fundamental change in the provision of public services in the future and a complete new approach for Governments to work and interact with their citizens. Currently, Societies witness more than ever that Web 2.0 and social media in particular, constitute the emerging, if not already established, mass collaboration and cooperation platform between citizens and administrations, as the latter have started to realise the benefits of such applications. The COCKPIT project builds on these developments and based on a highly synergetic approach aims to define a new Governance model for the next generation public service delivery, by combining various research areas.

Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore consequences of the use of social media for idea generation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper analyzes over 600 ideas submitted to a Slate-Twitter contest to find the best short characterization of the American Declaration of Independence. These findings are then compared with those of Kornish and Ulrich, who analyzed idea-contests in classroom settings. Findings: In the Slate-Twitter contest, repetition of ideas was rare while recombination was frequent. The evolution in the total number of unique ideas suggests that the contest became more focused over time. It also appears that ideas that are recognized as valuable attract similar ideas in turn. Research limitations/implications: Further checks will be needed with regard to the robustness of the findings. Furthermore, while the current analysis relies on peer review by participants to the contest to value submissions, results might be different if it were done on the basis of independent external reviews. Conceptually, the findings suggest that idea generation via social media has a more iterative character than previously analyzed forms of broadcast search. Future research could investigate what triggers more exploration and exploitation of ideas in this process. Practical implications: For businesses, which are more and more encouraged to engage in open innovation, the analysis can serve as guide on the use of social media for information collection. Originality/value: The paper provides a simple and effective method to monitor social media, which firms can use to their advantage. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Ref061
In the paradigm of open innovation, it is recognised that valuable innovation-related knowledge is being increasingly widely distributed to various actors, organisations and communities. Social media can provide novel and useful ways of interacting and collaborating in innovation, likewise for creating new information and knowledge about customers for innovations. These have not so far been much investigated because of the novelty of social media concepts and approaches. Furthermore, the opportunities of social media are not yet well understood in the contexts of innovation and customer interaction, and importantly, while the business-to-consumer sector standpoint has been more researched and understood, the business-to-business sector standpoint has been very little studied in the above contexts. With the help of a literature review and a survey in Finnish companies, we studied the current situation regarding the opportunities of social media in facilitating customer interaction in the innovation process.

Social media refers to a combination of three elements: content, user communities and Web 2.0 technologies. This foresight report presents six roadmaps of the anticipated developments of social media in three themes: society, companies, and local environment. One of the roadmaps, the meta-roadmap, is the synthesis of them all. The society sub-roadmap explores societal participation through communities. There are three sub-roadmaps relating to companies: interacting with companies through communities, social media in work environment, and social media enhanced shopping. The local environment sub-roadmap looks at social media in local environment. The roadmapping process was carried out through two workshops at VTT. The results of the report are crystallized into five main development lines triggered by social media. First development line is transparency referring to its increasing role in society, both with positive and negative consequences. The second development line is the rise of ubiquitous participatory communication model. This refers to an increase of two-directional and community-based interactivity in every field, where it has some added value. The third development is reflexive empowerment. This refers to the role of social media as an enabler of grass-root community collaboration. The fourth development line is the duality personalization/fragmentation vs. mass effects/integration. Personalization/ fragmentation emphasises the tailoring of the web services and content. This development is counterweighted by mass effects/integration, like the formation of super-nodes in the web. The fifth development line is the new relations of physical and virtual worlds. This development line highlights the idea that practices induced by social media, e.g. communication, participation, co-creation, feedback and rating, will get more common in daily environment, and that virtual and physical worlds will be more and more interlinked.

Purpose The main purpose of this paper is to investigate how social media can provide important platforms to facilitate organisational learning and innovation in new product development (NPD) process. Design/methodology/approach Using a multiple case-study approach, this study assesses qualitative data collected via 56 interviews from 13 world-leading Chinese companies in the high-technology industry. Findings The study identified three distinct types of organisational learning mechanisms for firms to extract potential innovation inherent in social media. It further determined various organisational enablers that facilitate the connections between these mechanisms and NPD performance. Research limitations/implications This research contributes to the emerging literature on digital product development and organisational learning. The cases were conducted in the Chinese context, hence, the results may not be fully generalisable to other organisations, industries and countries without appropriate re-contextualisation. Practical implications The empirical evidence showcases the various mechanisms adopted by managers in different NPD phases. It identifies several technological and organisational adaptations that managers can apply to smartly scale their social presence and facilitate NPD. Originality/value Despite the exponential growth of social media use in identifying and interacting with external stakeholders, managerial practice and academic research have paid little attention to how social media can be leveraged for NPD. The value of this research comes from applying a qualitative method to gain in-depth insights into the mechanisms for leveraging social media to facilitate innovation in NPD.;Ref064
The paper focuses on virtual brand community (VBC) as new management tool for open innovation. Existing research on the intersection between brand communities and innovation management shows how the knowledge of the brand communities' members and their engagement in product-related discussions represent a relevant source of innovation for the companies. However, how do companies implement open innovation through the VBC and how do they implement purposeful practices represent an unexplored research area. By adopting a value-oriented perspective of open innovation, this study interprets the VBC as a co-creation space where undertaking opportunity identification and resource mobilization for value creation and value capture. The paper presents a single case study of a multinational company operating in the semiconductor industry that has recently implemented a VBC as a tool for peer-to-peer support and knowledge sharing. Results show the features of this VBC and the set of practices designed to realize the open innovation strategies. By adopting an open innovation perspective, the article presents a model of VBC as a collaborative space for innovation. For practitioners, the article provides evidences and insights about the use of VBC to support the implementation of open innovation strategies.;Ref065
This paper provided a novel definition of customer knowledge management (CKM) as the logical intersection of customer relationship management (CRM) and knowledge management (KM). The main aim was to investigate the digital technologies supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) operating in creative industries in their customer knowledge management strategies. To achieve this aim, a survey involving 73 handicraft and/or retail SMEs operating in luxury jewelry industry was conducted. The survey results pointed out that in a few years the scenario has changed and that surveyed SMEs make more intensive use of traditional technologies supporting customer knowledge management processes rather than more innovative digital technologies, which are also cheap and easy to use. This finding showed the difficulties of SMEs operating in creative industries to be responsive to the rapid technological changes that are affecting CKM, as well as the lack of support from information technology vendors in the decision-making process for choosing adequate digital systems.;Ref066
Retail firms are increasingly using social media for purposes other than traditional marketing, such as innovation. Yet, while the innovation literature has established the benefits of involving customers in the development of products/services through open innovation, the role of social media in innovation is not well understood. Accordingly, we investigate how social media drives innovation in retail businesses. Using data from 414 firms, we find that social media positively relates to radical and incremental innovation, mediated by multiple digital channels and moderated by digital capabilities. Consequently, we propose a social media dynamic capabilities framework to guide future research and innovation in retail business.;Ref067
Societies face difficult challenges which require responses that go beyond the innovation capability of most public sector organisations. Open approaches to public sector innovation that exploits digital technologies have been proposed for some years to close this gap, but our knowledge of the use and outcome of using open innovation in this context is limited. This research takes stock of the study and use of these approaches by investigating the purposes for which public sector organisations use open innovation, and how it creates value. The research question is answered through a systematic literature review and an analysis of publicly available data about the open innovation projects referred to in that literature. The research identifies five different purposes of using open innovation. It also suggests that public sector organisations primarily use open innovation to pursue one specific purpose: innovation in society. When using open innovation for this purpose, public sector organisations attempt to create value by improving citizens' quality of life and the quality of neighbourhoods. They do this primarily by co-specialising IT and other resources in society (e.g. the transportation system) and by using the outcome of this co-specialisation process to change citizen behaviour, capabilities and experiences (e.g. encouraging citizens to use the transportation system more efficiently or making citizens feel more safe when using the transportation system). This research indicates that open innovation is generally not used to open up public sector organisations or to give citizens more influence in public sector or democratic processes. The research also indicates that open innovation, until now, has primarily been used to solve minor problems, and not large scale wicked problems in society. The research suggests a framework for value creation from open innovation initiatives that pursues innovation in society. This framework might help public sector organisations increase value creation and solve wicked problems using open innovation, and might help researchers to focus future open innovation research on essential knowledge gaps.;Ref068
"Drawing upon the knowledge-based view, this study divides firm knowledge-processing capability (KPC) into market and technical knowledge-processing capabilities, and examines the moderating effect of social media use and two knowledge-processing capabilities on customer participation (CP) in new product development (NPD). The results show that social media use enhances the effect of customer participation on NPD performance (product innovativeness, market performance, and financial performance); firms' two key capabilities (market knowledge-processing capability and technical knowledge-processing capability) further strengthen the moderating effect of social media use. Furthermore, the effect of customer participation on product innovativeness follows an inverted U-shape. This study not only confirms the crucial role of social media use and firm capabilities in customer participation in NPD but also provides firms with theoretical direction for how to use social media.";Ref069
In collaborative crowdsourcing communities for open innovation, users generate and submit ideas as idea co-creators. Firms then select and implement valuable ideas for new product development. Despite the popularity and success of these open innovation communities, relatively little is known about the factors that determine the implementation of the user-generated ideas. Based on research on individual creativity, we propose a conceptual model integrating users' previous experience, idea presentation characteristics and feedback valence to explain the likelihood of idea implementation. We validate our research model with a panel data analysis of 43 550 ideas submitted by 16 360 users in the MIUI new product development community hosted by Xiaomi, a large electronics manufacturing company in China. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between users' past successful experience and idea implementation. Furthermore, the length of ideas is positively associated with the likelihood of idea implementation. There is also an inverted U-shaped relationship between supporting evidence and idea implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the negative effect of positive feedback and the positive effect of negative feedback on idea implementation. These findings offer rich insights to understand the phenomenon of open innovation better. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.;Ref070
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to verify the relationship between the features of social media and knowledge sharing, and to examine how ambient awareness mediates this relationship. Design/methodology/approach An experiment is designed to stimulate the knowledge work in a famous Chinese business college and 156 valid samples were obtained. AMOS was used in this paper to examine the theoretical model. Findings There is a correlation among features of social media, ambient awareness and knowledge sharing. Surprisingly, network translucence, which indicates individuals' meta-knowledge of others' connections, has no influence on knowledge sharing. Although this is inconsistent with conjecture of the existing literature, it can be well explained by the phenomenon in real life, such as privacy setting in social media. Originality/value This paper proposes that ambient awareness is the mediator of the effect path between communication and knowledge sharing. And the status perception of coworkers' exchanging information is closely related to knowledge sharing.;Ref071
This research focuses on how the tourism and hospitality industry is applying the paradigm of open innovation, supported by social media. Open innovation (OI) has been on the topical research agenda, but the previous literature lacks studies in the service sector and specifically for tourism companies. Moreover, the introduction of social media as a tool to implement open innovation is considered the main research gap. Structural equation modelling is applied to data from 181 Portuguese and Spanish companies to study both customer involvement in new product development and the perceptions and results in terms of turnover and competitiveness. The structure of the relationships between research and development, external openness and open innovation management is highlighted with statistical analysis. In addition, the introduction of social media adds value to the proposed model. Currently, there is a lack of available models to give structure to the OI paradigm and to allow us to manage it. The contribution of this research is a comparison of the explanatory power of three models that allow us to test how certain strategic guidelines in tourism companies influence each other and have a mediating or multiplier effect when linked to each other (nested models method). In conclusion, the originality of this research is based on the relationship between open innovation management and social media and the mediating effect of external openness.;Ref072
We discuss ICT for Open Innovation (OI) from a capabilities perspective. We distinguish two types of capabilities for OI: strategic, which need to be developed so that the organization can take advantage of an OI strategy proactively, and operational for the efficient implementation of OI processes. ICT at the strategic level supports dynamic capabilities and related cognitive processes of managerial staff for developing and using the appropriate level of absorptive capacity and active transparency, whereas ICT as part of operational capabilities aims at enhancing the day-to-day performance of OI activities. Through analysis of capabilities, we associate specific ICT with the functionalities required in the entire OI process. Paying particular attention to the issues of collaboration and sophisticated data analysis, we also comment on the seamless integration of these technologies and their embedment in OI-related organizational processes.

Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how communication practices influence individuals' team assembly and performance in open innovation contests. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed behavioral trace data of 4,651 teams and 19,317 participants from a leading open innovation platform, Kaggle. The analyses applied weighted least squares regression and weighted mediation analysis. Findings Sharing online profiles positively relates to a person's performance and likelihood of becoming a leader in open innovation teams. Team assembly effectiveness (one's ability to team up with high-performing teammates) mediates the relationship between online profile sharing and performance. Moreover, sharing personal websites has a stronger positive effect on performance and likelihood of becoming a team leader, compared to sharing links to professional social networking sites (e.g. LinkedIn). Practical implications Open innovation organizers should encourage online profile sharing among participants to facilitate effective team assembly in order to improve innovation outcomes. Originality/value The current study highlights the importance of team assembly in open innovation, especially the role of sharing online profiles in this process. It connects two areas of research that are previously distant, one on team assembly and one on online profile sharing. It also adds new empirical evidence to the discussion about online information credibility.;Ref074
"Purpose The purpose of this study is to offer implications and future research directions related to new organizational forms like crowds. Organizations are increasingly relying on online crowds to innovate through mechanisms such as crowdsourcing, open innovation, innovation challenges and tournaments. To leverage the ""wisdom of crowds"", crowdsourcing platforms that enable heterogeneous knowledge sharing in crowds lead to novel solution generation by individuals in the crowd. Based on the associative variety memory model of creativity, the authors hypothesize that when a crowd contributes a heterogeneous knowledge in form of a variety of knowledge associations, individual crowd members tend to generate solutions that are more novel. In contrast to the brainstorming view that focuses on ideas as knowledge, the authors propose, test, find and elaborate on implications of crowd sharing of heterogeneous knowledge for the generation of innovation, i.e. novel ideas. The authors coded and analyzed all the posts in 20 innovation challenges leveraging online temporary crowds that were structured to foster knowledge sharing as part of the idea generation process. The analysis shows a positive relationship between the variety of knowledge associations contributed by the crowd and the generation of novel solutions by individuals in the crowd. Further, the variety of knowledge associations contributed by the crowd has a stronger relationship with novel solution generation than the number of associations generated by the crowd, i.e. variety of knowledge has a greater impact than either the quantity of knowledge or the number of solution-ideas shared. The authors offer four implications and several future directions for research on the new organizational form of online crowds. Design/methodology/approach The authors coded and analyzed all the posts in 20 innovation challenges. They also designed and ran these challenges in collaboration with corporate sponsors. The ideas in the challenge were rated by senior executive at each company using a creative forecasting method. Findings The variety of knowledge associations contributed by the crowd has a stronger relationship with novel solution generation than the number of associations generated by the crowd, i.e. variety of knowledge has a greater impact than either the quantity of knowledge or the number of solution-ideas shared. Originality/value The authors believe that we are the first empirical paper to emphasize and show that associative variety of knowledge sharing in crowds has impact on novel idea generation by crowds. This view is counter to ""electronic brainstorming"" view where crowd is asked to just generate these ideas and often just submit their ideas to the sponsor. Their view also goes beyond knowledge refinement of ideas by crowds to more of knowledge integration by crowds.";Ref075
Car-hailing platform governance is an emerging topic of research and practice. The governance of the data-driven platform economy is challenging the research paradigm of competition regulation in the context of open innovation. This research is trying to reveal the market allocation structure of China's online car-hailing industry from the perspective of personal data allocation by the study of Application Programming Interface (API) of sample platforms. On the basis of the networked nature of personal data allocation via APIs, this research constructs a mathematical model of the edge weight of data resource connections between platforms. Furthermore, this research optimises the structural hole analysis of complex networks to discuss the state of personal data resource allocation in China's car-hailing industry. Results reveal that there are obvious structural holes within the sample network. When compared with related indicators, we found that accessing personal data resources is an essential component of the sample network competition capability and sustainable innovation. Social media platforms and online payment platforms more greatly impact car-hailing platform competition than other types of platforms within the multi-sided market context. This research offers a research perspective of personal data allocation for further study of competition, regulation and sustainable innovation of data-driven platform economies.;Ref076
One of the main challenges of open innovation communities is how to create value from shared content either by selecting those ideas that are worthy of pursuit and implementation or by identifying the users' preferences and needs. These tasks can be done manually when there is an overseeable amount of content or by using computational tools when there are massive amounts of data. However, previous studies on text mining have not dealt with the identification of unique attributes, which can be defined as those contributions that are inextricably linked with a specific tag or category within open innovation websites. The uniqueness of these ideas means that they can only be obtained through a selection of one choice among several alternatives. To obtain such unique ideas and thus to also obtain innovations, this paper proposes a novel methodology called co-occurrence differential analysis. The proposed methodology combines traditional co-occurrence analysis with additional statistical processing to obtain the unique attributes and topics associated with different alternatives. The identification of unique content provides valuable information that can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of several options in a comparative fashion.;Ref077
Social media are essentially changing the way firms communicate, create and collaborate in and for innovation. In this special issue introductory article, we take stock of the robust multi-faceted nature of research and practice at the intersection of social media (SM) and innovation. We introduce the nine papers included in this special issue and highlight the rich variety of their contribution with reference to our organising framework. Diagnosing from a strategic perspective, we position SM strategy in and for innovation as an overlapping interaction between dynamic capabilities (sensing, seizing, reconfiguration) and the level of stakeholder engagement (macro, meso, micro). We explain how each interaction holds distinctive synergy in an open and collaborative innovation process. This organising framework shows how the malleable nature of SM creates opportunities for firms to engage widely distributed knowledge sources, enhance innovation capabilities and empower internal human resources towards an open and collaborative culture. Yet, we warn that all is not as rosy as it seems and a purposeful and coherent strategy that delivers distinctive 'co-ownership' experiences is quintessential ingredient to realise profits from SM use in innovation.;Ref078
With firms' increasing use of social media platforms, such as online user innovation communities (OUICs), customers are actively participating in firm-sponsored innovation activity by posting and commenting on new ideas for improving the firms' products and services, or to develop new ones. While it has been suggested that OUICs promote user interactions, it is largely unclear how other users' feedback may stimulate a focal user's contribution to such OUICs. Drawing on a media usage theory, we identify multifaceted benefits from user feedback that are cognitive, integrative and affective in the archival comments received by a focal user, and examine their individual and joint impacts on the user's future contribution in terms of both ideating and commenting behavior. We conduct a longitudinal study by collecting a large-scale, quantitative data set from a leading OUIC between 2008 and 2015, which reveals novel findings on the nuanced role of user feedback on social media in stimulating innovation.;Ref079
Numerous reports have been published concerning the conditions under which a firm should rely on crowdsourcing for its innovation processes. This choice is the first order problem of crowdsourcing. Yet, once the decision to crowdsource has been made, the seeker must still decide whether to proceed internally with a proprietary platform, or to rely on the use of an open, external platform. This is the second order problem of crowdsourcing for which a theoretical analysis is offered in the present study. The conditions under which the use of an open, intermediary platform can be considered more appropriate than an exclusive, proprietary platform are analyzed. In particular, the role of transaction costs, network externalities and internal competencies are examined. Following this analysis, a decision-making model is proposed.;Ref080
"Firms are increasingly leveraging social media tools to access knowledge from external actors, particularly customers and other users, to facilitate the innovation process and firm performance. Yet empirical research investigating the impact of external knowledge sourced via social media tools is scant; empirical studies that do exist are mixed, leading to calls for research into the conditions under which knowledge flows via social media from external actors contribute to innovation and firm performance. Using a large-scale survey of firms in Tasmania, Australia, this study examines how external knowledge flows from market-based actors sourced by social media influence innovation and business performance, and the extent to which modem human resource management (HRM) practices moderate this relationship. We find that while knowledge flows from market-based actors are positively related to innovativeness, the relationship between external knowledge flows via social media and innovativeness depends on the importance a firm places on modern HRM practices: a significant positive relationship exists between knowledge sourced via social media and innovativeness when firms attach high importance to modern HRM practices. In contrast, there is no significant relationship in firms in which modem HRM practices are of low importance. The study also shows that social media serves as a mediator for the effect of external knowledge flows on firm innovativeness when firms attach high importance to modern HRM practices. Furthermore, while the results demonstrate that innovativeness and firm performance are positively related, innovativeness does not translate into improved firm performance in firms that attach low importance to modern HRM practices. Taken together, the findings underscore the importance of modem HRM practices to enable knowledge inflows via social media to influence innovativeness, and innovativeness to translate into productivity benefits.";Ref081
As the concept of co-creation has evolved in the innovation management literature its meaning has become ambiguous and the boundaries between it and the concept of open innovation have become opaque. The purpose of this paper is to more clearly define the concept of co-creation and to articulate how it differs from and relates to the concept of open innovation. Scholars are divided as to whether co-creation is a subsidiary concept of open innovation, a surrogate concept that is essentially indistinguishable from open innovation, or a separate concept that developed independently but was subsequently intermingled and interfused with open innovation. This paper addresses this scholarly confusion by conducting a systematic two-stage review of the innovation management literature, commencing with of a 'broad brush' bibliometric analysis, focused on the origins and evolution of co-creation and open innovation, followed by a 'deep dive' literature review in which the two concepts were rigorously compared. By proposing a cogent definition and taxonomy of co-creation, and thereby distinguishing it from open innovation, the paper goes beyond the current state of the literature and provides a more robust basis for future research.;Ref082
The question of how important firms' investments in digital communication formats are for the commercial success of new products remains unexplored in the product innovation management literature. Drawing on reactance theory, the authors examine the extent to which investments in social media communication and online advertising are related to the sales volume and profits of new products within six months of being launched. Using dyadic survey data, an analysis of new products launched by 122 consumer durable goods firms reveals that sales volume and profits of new products are associated with (1) social media communication in a positive but diminishing shape, and (2) online advertising in an inverted U-shape. Further analyses show that those curvilinear relationships are steeper for social media communication and flatter for online advertising at respective (1) higher levels of customer product involvement and (2) lower levels of product superiority. The results imply that there is an optimal level of investment in social media communication and online advertising, with the optimum dependent on a new product's consumer involvement and superiority levels.;Ref083
Energy utility firms operate under varying mandates throughout most of the world and typically must operate reliably with long planning cycles and requirements to meet bureaucratic scrutiny and regulatory toll gating to achieve both discrete plan approvals as well as their ongoing licenses to operate. One vehicle for gaining external insights and involving the stakeholders is crowdsourcing. Energy utility firms have a set of distinguishing characteristics (i.e. regulatory processes and stakeholder groups) that they must consider when implementing crowdsourcing activities to aid their planning and innovation strategies. To achieve constructive participation requires understanding and engaging the motivations of the population from which a firm wishes to draw input. We assert that customers' interest, facilitated by digital age communication channels, can provide utility operators with an accessible, valuable resource to assist a wide range of planning and innovation activities. We use the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) lens, grounded by a set of in-depth interviews with utility industry professionals, to articulate motivations for members of the external customer community to provide value to the firms through crowdsourcing activities. We develop five propositions that collectively identify how energy firms should use SDT elements to design crowdsourcing activities.;Ref084
Despite increasing attention to the influence of customer involvement and social media in developing innovation in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), few studies have specifically investigated how to improve the effectiveness of social media-based customer involvement. Drawing on the knowledge-based view, social network and capability theories, we address this question by arguing that Social Customer Relation Management (CRM) enhances the effect of social media-based customer involvement upon innovation. Two key capabilities further enhance the moderating effect of Social CRM: social media network and customer information processing capabilities. The results from a longitudinal dataset of 317 SMEs indicate that SME customer involvement, enabled by Social CRM, social media network and customer information processing capabilities increases innovation. These findings have important implications for researchers and managers interested in enhancing the efficacy of SME customer involvement using social media.;Ref085
"This study explores the potential of crowdfunding as a tool for achieving ""citizen co-funding"" of public projects. Focusing on philanthropic crowdfunding, we examine whether collaborative projects between public and private organizations are more successful in fundraising than projects initiated solely by private organizations. We argue that government involvement in crowdfunding provides some type of accreditation or certification that attests to a project's aim to achieve public rather than private goals, thereby mitigating information asymmetry and improving mutual trust between creators (i.e., private sector organizations) and funders (i.e., crowd). To support this argument, we show that crowdfunding projects with government involvement achieved a greater success rate and attracted a greater amount of funding than comparable projects without government involvement. This evidence shows that governments may take advantage of crowdfunding to ""co-fund"" public projects with the citizenly for addressing the complex challenges that we face in the twenty-first century.";Ref086
"Firms are increasingly engaging in crowdsourcing for innovation to access new knowledge beyond their boundaries; however, scholars are no closer to understanding what guides seeker firms in deciding the level at which to acquire rights from solvers and the effect that this decision has on the performance of crowdsourcing contests. Integrating property rights theory and the problem-solving perspective while leveraging exploratory interviews and observations, we build a theoretical framework to examine how specific attributes of the technical problem broadcast by firms affect the seekers' choice between alternative intellectual property rights (IPR) arrangements that call for acquiring or licensing-in IPR from external solvers (i.e., with high and low degrees of ownership, respectively). Each technical problem differs in the knowledge required to be solved as well as in the stage of development of the innovation process and seeker firms pay great attention to such characteristics when deciding about the IPR arrangement they choose for their contests. In addition, we analyze how this choice between acquiring and licensing-in IPR, in turn, influences the performance of the contest. We empirically test our hypotheses analyzing a unique dataset of 729 challenges broadcast on the InnoCentive platform from 2010 to 2016. Our results indicate that challenges related to technical problems in later stages of the innovation process are positively related to the seekers' preference toward IPR arrangements with a high level of ownership, while technical problems involving a higher number of knowledge domains are not. Moreover, we found that IPR arrangements with a high level of ownership negatively affect solvers' participation and that IPR arrangement play a mediating role between the attributes of the technical problem and the solvers' self-selection process. Our paper contributes to the open innovation and crowdsourcing literature and provides practical implications for both managers and contest organizers.";Ref087
Taking the knowledge-based view of the firm as its starting point, and acknowledging that knowledge can lie outside the firm, this research extends our understanding of how the growing social media trend can contribute to open innovation. It focuses specifically on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which tend to be resource constrained and might benefit particularly from leveraging social media platforms. The authors bring forward the notion that people flock to social media because they are motivated by a desire for social interaction. Indeed, the findings suggest that SMEs that put effort into connecting customers on social media - which the authors refer to as having a 'social strategy' - are likely to reap both customers' involvement in innovation on social media and new knowledge of value for innovation. Examining differences between social media platforms used primarily for personal purposes and those used primarily for professional purposes, the authors find that a social strategy is more effective in the first category than in the second. This probably reflects differences in the social identities that people adopt on these two types of social media platforms.;Ref088
This paper aims to contribute to the debate on Open Innovation in the age of Big Data by shedding new light on the role that social networks can play as enabling platforms for tourists' involvement and sources for the creation and management of valuable knowledge assets. The huge amount of data generated on social media by tourists related to their travel experiences can be a valid source of open innovation. To achieve this aim, this paper presents evidence of a digital tourism experience, through a longitudinal case study of a destination in Apulia, a Southern European region. The findings of the study demonstrate how social Big Data could open up innovation processes that could be of support in defining sustainable tourism experiences in a destination.;Ref089
Open innovation has become an emergent topic in innovation management founded on the assumption that the development of innovative processes may lie outside the companies' boundaries. In particular, this paper has pursued to address one gap in existing research on open innovation, namely the investigation of its relationship with market orientation that promotes continual processes of innovation leading to higher customer value. Findings have shown how market-driven companies tend to overcome the classical view on relying innovation on internal Research & Development departments in order to become more permeable to the outside environment. In fact, market-driven companies develop distinctive outside-in, inside-out, and spanning capabilities that encourage the matching and integration of internal resources with external partners and open innovation emerges as an essential driver to preserve and improve their competitiveness.;Ref090
Online communities can be an attractive source of ideas for product and process innovations. However, innovative user-contributed ideas may be few. From a perspective of harnessing big data for inbound open innovation, the detection of good ideas in online communities is a problem of detecting rare events. Recent advances in text analytics and machine learning have made it possible to screen vast amounts of online information and automatically detect user-contributed ideas. However, it is still uncertain whether the ideas identified by such systems will also be regarded as sufficiently novel, feasible and valuable by firms who might decide to develop them further. A validation study is reported in which 200 posts from an online home brewing community were extracted by an automatic idea detection system. Two professionals from a brewing company evaluated the posts in terms of idea content, idea novelty, idea feasibility and idea value. The results suggest that the automatic idea detection system is sufficiently valid to be deployed for the harvesting and initial screening of ideas, and that the profile of the identified ideas (in terms of novelty, feasibility and value) follows the same pattern identified in studies of user ideation in general.;Ref091
Purpose Co-innovation networks face the important challenge of cultivating collective innovation outcomes while also preserving the interests of individual contributors. Addressing this challenge requires first understanding and then managing individuals' perception of co-innovation risks. The purpose of this paper is to provide a meaningful approach to addressing co-innovation risks using a valid and reliable model to assess actors' perception of risk and examine its effect on actor co-innovation behavior. Design/methodology/approach The construct of co-innovation risk from the actor's perspective was conceptualized based on a case study of a co-innovation network. The measurement items underwent a pilot study and a field study to establish the necessary reliability and validity. This paper also empirically assesses a nomological network that illustrates the effect of risk on co-innovation behavior with a moderating effect of prior experience. Findings Co-innovation actors perceived four different individual risks: time, social, intellectual property right, and financial. The empirical results from the field study demonstrate a high degree of confidence in both translation validity and criterion-related validity. Negative effects of perceived co-innovation risk on actors' continuous intention to ideate, collaborate, and communicate in co-innovation were evident, but prior experience moderated these relationships. Originality/value Drawing from co-innovation and individual risk literature, this study develops and validates a general instrument to measure co-innovation risk from the actors' perspective. The result is a reliable and parsimonious instrument with 15 items, which contributes significantly to future empirical investigations of co-innovation behavior on virtual platforms.;Ref092
Effective workgroups engage in team boundary spanning, that is, using communication ties as conduits to critical external resources. The proliferation of enterprise social media (ESM) and the associated increase in visibility of people, content, and interactions, has resulted in a widespread assumption that unlimited visibility improves boundary spanning. Consequently, the ESM literature has generally ignored the sentry functions of teams and failed to examine the possible strategic nature of visibility choices by ESM groups. Using log and content data from 655 ESM-based workgroups at a multinational enterprise, we contribute a deeper understanding of the distinct ways that ESM visibility-bounded or unbounded-is leveraged strategically to evoke diverse network structures, which in turn have implications for distinct boundary-spanning activities. Practically, these findings show that ESM present a unique opportunity for workgroups to simultaneously sustain multiple virtual spaces-with varying levels of visibility-through which they can manage their diverse boundary-spanning goals.;Ref093
This article examines unconventional entrepreneurship (accidental or end-user entrepreneurs) to determine whether the decision-making phase of the entrepreneurial process is collective. The analysis identified a virtuous circle that links knowledge, innovation, judgment, and decision making to collective interactions built on passion, experience, and sharing. To study food bloggers as unconventional user entrepreneurs, data were collected and analyzed using netnographic analysis. A supplementary online survey of food bloggers and their followers was also performed. Three groups of food bloggers are identified: amusing, functional, and fervent. Only fervent food bloggers, thanks to the virtuous circle built on passion, experience, and sharing as enablers, can be considered accidental or end-user entrepreneurs.;Ref094
Consumption-based virtual communities are nowadays a common place on the Internet where individuals share and acquire knowledge on food and specific food-related issues such as preparation and cooking. The objective of this research is to propose and test a model that illustrates the role of motivation to self-present to and learn from the community regarding consumers' willingness to interact in virtual food communities. The study investigates 1) the associations between the pre-existing consumer interests in food and general online interaction, and consumers' willingness to interact in virtual food communities, and 2) the mediating role of consumers' motivation to self-present to and learn from the community in explaining these associations. An online questionnaire (n = 980) was conducted among Danish consumers. Results showed that motivation to learn and motivation to self-present are strong mediators of the relationships especially between food involvement and behavioural interaction intention. The chance to learn from and present oneself to the community are reasons why consumers engage in interaction in virtual food communities, given their pre-existing interest in food and, to some extent, their general online interaction propensity. Virtual food communities should therefore provide consumers with the opportunity to present themselves as skilled individuals to the community and the opportunity to learn from the information available from that community. Still, community managers must keep in mind that these opportunities will only appeal to food involved consumers with a certain online interaction propensity.;Ref095
"The Internet has dramatically changed everyone's access to information, knowledge and other people. In many fields, this has resulted in an opening up of business models, products, services and organizations. Examples include open academic publishing, open software and open innovation. Experts are increasingly aware that a significant amount of knowledge and experience exists outside of their companies and institutions, which used to be the exclusive creator, aggregator and curator of knowledge and the sole places of innovation. Institutions are responding by reducing their boundaries and are opening up to the outside. A particularly potent technology for engaging people and capturing their knowledge has been social media. However, theories of participation and participatory approaches to shaping the built environment greatly predate even the Internet. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for open and creative designing. A proven three-tier architecture, various theoretical levels of participation and an abstract view on social media tools have been used to develop an original, flexible, generative, ""one size does not fit all"" platform that can be used for the optimal collection of external information and knowledge. The platform allows for simple enhancement of in-house information systems (IS) with socially rich components. We are finding such a modular approach as very flexible for organizations that host the planning processes and that the application of social media technology creates very low barriers for the public to contribute.

Despite rigorous empirical research exploring the changes in innovation dynamics triggered by Social Media Networks (SMNs), the benefits coming from the use of these digital platforms for knowledge search in innovative activities for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) are still unexplored. Customers become the new trailblazers. Thus, by adopting a customer led innovation perspective, this paper seeks to measure the effect on return on investment (ROI) of the use of SMNs as external drivers for supporting internal innovation search processes. On the basis of the extant literature on information system and social network analysis, the research describes and evaluates the multidimensional activities interwoven into the open innovation process, driven by integrating the five constructs of structural dimension, relational behaviour, cognitive dimension, knowledge transfer, and legitimization into our hypothesised conceptual model. Empirical research was conducted via the Classification Regression Tree (CART) on a sample of 2548 SMEs belonging to the fashion industry and based in Italy and in the United Kingdom. This study is of importance to academics and practitioners due to the increasing significance taken on by the adoption of social media networks in the fashion industry to improve innovation search. Recommendations are made to fashion managers and social media experts to support the planning and development of new products and services. New contributions are offered to the innovation and knowledge management literature. In addition, theoretical implications and avenues for future research are also considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Innovation scholars have long recognized entrepreneurship is imitative', whereas the commercialization of novelty is innovative'. Thus they are highly distinctive skill-sets. Entrepreneurship, first, involves optimizing market sentiment for pure profit sometimes to the point of catastrophe and even fraudulence in many markets. These include: payment protection insurance (PPI) to flash crashes', automotive emission defeat devices', corporate bribery settlements, social media hacking', fake news' and a litany of other infractions and catastrophes. Innovation, by contrast, is more explorative and team-reliant. Even if patenting betrays the hope for commercialization on markets, patented innovation frequently fails. Some academic innovators even profess a preference for prizes over profits. Second, this means that collective bonding' among entrepreneurs, in the form of claimed entrepreneurial ecosystems', is often based on a single customer platform or as a supplier of a highly specialist type of imitative' service from identikit pizza chains to me-too' smartphone apps. Through the latter, fused with artificial intelligence some interactive machine-learning services have long-existed as postsocial' algorithms serving customers of, for example, investment banks in stock and currency markets. Finally, entrepreneurship is fundamentally competitive, individualistic and non-solidaristic, whereas open innovation' was born from the practices of open science' and the collegiate tradition of research. Accordingly, entrepreneurial ecosystems' can display more closure than RIS set-ups. This special issue explores aspects of these ecosystem platforms and their implications for emergent forms of urban and regional evolution in the near and nearly present future.;Ref098
This article revisits the concept of the public sector innovation champion. Reflecting changes in sectoral and wider contexts and conceptual advances in the innovation literature, it suggests that much of the underlying thinking behind the original article is of continuing relevance and suggests a number of directions in which this could now be extended, particularly in terms of the nature of innovation and the role of champions therein. It concludes by considering how innovation champions of the future will require a new skillset which draws on new and emergent technologies to align diverse sets of stakeholders in networks of open innovation'.;Ref099
Government transparency and information disclosure have received increasing attention from both academics and practitioners with the development of information technologies (Hs) and the Internet. Moreover, the popularity of social media applications has provided governments, especially governments in China and other developing countries, with new opportunities and challenges associated with the administrative shift toward open innovation. The official document exchange via microblogging (ODEM) of the Haining Bureau of Justice is a practical case of government open innovation in the social media context. Based on the ODEM case, this study uses the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to explore the factors that drive open innovation in China. We find that the support of top managers, the access and competence of IT personnel, and the regional economic and social environments are key determinants of the emergence of open innovation in the public sector.

This study seeks to address two research questions. First, how can citizen online communities support open innovation practices in the public sector? Second, what kinds of contributions are produced through social media platforms? These questions are examined through an experimental research setting and by analyzing interactions and contributions made in a neighborhood development-oriented Facebook group. This study contributes to the field of open innovation in the public sector by highlighting the networked nature of citizen participation and emphasizing citizens' capacity for meaningful contributions.

The concepts of open innovation and big data have been largely explored, but little research focused on the use of big data for open innovation activities. We explore how big data obtained by social media can be useful for open innovation activities in Television (TV) domain. Results demonstrate that the analysis of open data coming from social media data allows TV managers to identify the specific TV contents and Twitter elements, which are able to increase the social media traffic related to the show and gain insights for innovating the design of the TV show's episodes or seasons.;Ref102
This article proposes that mass collaborative knowledge management (MCKM) and social media networks (SMNs) tend to enhance productivity in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A case study methodology was employed to highlight the complementary advantages of MCKM related to the use of SMNs in a small business operating in southern Italy. The research aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion on MCKM. This article offers a fresh perspective by discussing the relevance of this construct for SMEs.;Ref103
"Motivated by the multiple 'success stories' of the open innovation paradigm in the private sector, and also by the increasing complexity of social problems and needs, the public sector has started moving in this direction, attempting to exploit the extensive knowledge of citizens for the development of innovations in public policies and services. As the direct transfer of open innovation methods from the private sector to the public sector is not possible, it is necessary to develop effective 'citizen-sourcing' methods, which address the specific needs of the public sector, and then analyze and evaluate them from various political and management sciences' perspectives. This paper makes a two-fold contribution in this direction: i) It evaluates a novel method of monitoring relevant social media (e.g. political blogs, news websites, and also Facebook, Twitter, etc. accounts) by government agencies, by retrieving and making advanced processing of their content, and extracting from it external knowledge about specific domains of government activity or public policies of interest, in order to promote and support open innovation; ii) For this purpose it develops a multi-perspective evaluation framework, based on sound theoretical foundations from the political and management sciences, which can be of wide applicability; it includes three evaluation perspectives: a political perspective (based on the 'wicked' social problems theory from the political sciences), a crowd-sourcing perspective (based on previous management sciences research on crowd sourcing) and a diffusion perspective (based on Roger's diffusion of innovation theory from management sciences). The above evaluation provides interesting insights into this novel method of promoting and supporting open innovation in the public sector through social media monitoring, revealing its capabilities and strengths, and at the same time its problems and weaknesses as well, and also ways/interventions for addressing the latter.

"As social media attract increasing attention from executives and find varied applications in different industries, research on the subject has been investigating the antecedents, moderators, mediators and outcomes of social media adoption, as well as impacts on the organizational and individual level. However, relatively little attention has been paid to the discussion of the new sources of social media innovation-i.e., the upstream originators of social media solutions. Such innovations of a possibly disruptive nature often originate from startups, which can constitute a significant driver for social media development and can influence the adopting incumbents' behaviors. This study aims at shedding first light on social media-based solutions developed and delivered by startups. By surveying the Crunchbase database, we identified 724 funded social media startups, which were further classified into six categories, namely: (i) social network; (ii) social commerce; (iii) social recruitment; (iv) social management; (v) social loyalty and advocacy; (vi) contact management. Our findings show how the large majority of startups deliver social network solutions to incumbents, followed by social media management applications. The findings also shed light on emerging approaches to value generation and open innovation from social media related to and driven by startups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.";Ref105
Sustainability and social media use in open innovation play important roles in a firm's new product development (NPD) process. This research examines, in conjunction, the roles of sustainability and social media driven inbound open innovation (SMOI) for a firm's NPD performance, and further, takes a more refined approach by differentiating between different types of SMOI activities. To this end, this research develops and tests a conceptual framework, which predicts that (1) a firm's sustainability orientation (SO) is positively associated with its NPD performance, (2) customer focus (CF) partially mediates the SO-NPD performance link, and (3) particular SMOI activities moderate the CF-NPD performance link. The empirical results, using data from the Product Development and Management Association (PDMA)'s comparative performance assessment study, provide support for most of the framework. Notably, this research documents a positive link between SO and NPD performance, as well as a partial mediating role of CF. The results further suggest that social media driven open innovation activities focused on gathering market insights enhance CF directly, while social media driven open innovation activities that garner technical expertise enhance the link between CF and NPD performance. This paper bridges the separate literatures on sustainability and open innovation, and contributes to the NPD research. The findings suggest that managers should take a strategic approach to sustainability and embed it in the NPD process. Furthermore, managers should manage social media based open innovation carefully to fully benefit the firm during the front end and back end of NPD.;Ref106
Social media (SM) allow users to easily create, edit, or share content. The vast numbers of individuals that converge around sites like LinkedIn, Facebook, or Twitter embody a rich source of external knowledge that could be utilized for new product development (NPD). Complementing other channels for open innovation (OI), SM can provide access to novel information about customer needs and technological solutions unknown to the firm. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are considerable benefits from using SM during an innovation project, but empirical evidence is scarce. Contributing to the perspective of openness in search, a number of hypotheses propose how SM as a new channel for OI can contribute to firm performance. This model is tested using data from the PDMA Comparative Performance Assessment Study, identifying factors influencing the relationship between SM and NPD performance. The findings indicate that utilizing information from SM channels can lead to higher performance, but that this link is influenced by the formalization of a firm's NPD process. This study also finds that the ability of a firm to benefit from external search in SM strongly depends on complementary internal processes when organizing and conducting this activity. Furthermore, managers have to take care when utilizing information from SM channels in radical projects, as for this kind of project only a weak significant performance contribution of SM could be found.;Ref107
Although many organizations have deployed social media tools to support business activities such as marketing or customer relationship management in the past several years, academic research on using social media for supporting innovation process is very limited. Many organizations find it challenging to effectively integrate social media into organizational innovation practices because social media are primarily complex, informal and episodic. In this research, we would like to explore how various organizational factors can contribute to social media use for supporting innovation process. We conducted a case study of two particular cases, one with an e-learning service unit at a public university and another with a large hotel chain company. Based on the findings of this case study, we proposed a process-based framework that could help organizations use social media to support innovation process. This case study also identified situational factors that could affect the use of social media for closed innovation and open innovation respectively. In addition, some useful guidelines and proven practices are revealed from this case study.;Ref108
"Some governments have proven social media's potential to generate value through co-creation and citizen participation, and municipalities are increasingly using these tools in order to become smart cities. Nevertheless, few public administrations have taken full advantage of all the possibilities offered by social media and, as a consequence, there is a shortage of case studies published on this topic. By analyzing the case study of the platform Santander City Brain, managed by the City Council of Santander (Spain), the current work contributes to broaden the knowledge on ambitious social media projects implemented by local public administrations for e-Government; therefore, this case can be useful for other public sector's initiatives. The case studied herein proves that virtual social media are effective tools for civil society, as it is able to set the political agenda and influence the framing of political discourse; however, they should not be considered as the main channel for citizen participation. Among the results obtained, the authors have found that several elements are required: the determination and involvement of the government, a designated community manager to follow up with the community of users, the secured privacy of its users, and a technological platform that is easy to use. Additionally, the Public Private Partnership model provides several advantages to the project, such as opening new sources of funding.";Ref109
"Purpose - This paper aims to examine the dynamics of a community of practice (CoP) through a case study of eCars - Now! They offer open- source blueprints of the electric conversion kits globally. The authors analysed the CoP by considering its entire life cycle, starting from the motives for its establishment, through its active performance, up to the current stage, where the members need to decide whether the community will remain viable. Particular attention was paid to the group dynamics and issues that seemed relevant to the change in dynamics which determine whether a CoP maintains its vitality or dissipates. Design/methodology/approach - The qualitative case study was chosen as the research strategy (Yin, 1984) to answer the research question and understand the target phenomenon of the CoP by analysing textual data. This particular case was chosen because of its unusual revelatory value for the case CoP which aims at creating a tangible innovation by using a platform that normally aims at intangible problem- solving (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). In the data collection, the authors used method and researcher triangulation (Patton, 1990). Findings - Life cycle analysis revealed four themes that explained the change in the group dynamics and the dispersal of the community: differentiation and dispersal of interests, growth that resulted in role differentiation, virtuality in community development and inclusion of investors. The themes were all related to the fact that the case community operated with not only knowledge, but also with a tangible product. Therefore, the tangibility of a problem to be solved seems to play a pivotal role in a CoP's operations and dynamics and, in part, also explains the changing role of information and communications technology (ICT) in the process. Research limitations/implications - However, this paper identified also different ways to characterize community participation, which was also relevant from group dynamics point of view. Thus, the topic should be studied further. Group dynamics in general, as it relates to the success of CoPs, should be also investigated further. Additional studies should implement the inclusion of external resources in the community. Further research is also needed to investigate tangible and intangible outcomes achieved through CoPs. Much of the available research was conducted over short periods; prolonged interactions in a CoP context could show different results. Practical implications - In conclusion, at the beginning of the life cycle of the eCars community, ICT played a significant role. It helped increase awareness of the community in the first place and enabled people to join in, which thus enabled the community to evolve. When the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became emphasized and much more important. In the maturing stage, the role of ICT, and especially social media, is the essential part of the community. Social implications - This analysis suggests that at the early stage of a community, the plans can be somewhat random, even utopian, but when the community evolves, this uncertainty can become a problem. First, it affects achieving the actual, and in this case, concrete results. Second, uncertainty and unclarity dampen enthusiasm and motivation, which are of utmost importance due to the voluntary participation. This paper also concludes that when the operations evolved and the life cycle progressed, both the physical meeting place as well as personal interaction and communication became increasingly important. Originality/value - This paper argues that the ideological basis for this kind of community should be openness. All information should be available for everyone who registers to the community platform on the internet. This community was working in the mindset of open innovation. Technical documentation and all other material were available for everyone in the community's wiki pages, which attracted a lot of people who were delighted by eCars. Many advisors delivered technical information and good advice to the practitioners of the community through the platform. The hang arounds were also very well-informed in this stage regarding how the core group was working.";Ref110
The literature on user innovation has not considered laggards - the last group of users to adopt a product - as a source of new ideas for innovative products and services. In this paper, we develop the Lag-User Method to investigate laggards' role in the process of idea generation and new product development (NPD) and so enable firms to gain access to their insights. We study laggards for 4 years in three countries and apply the Lag-User Method to different technologies, products, and services, thereby generating 62 innovative ideas across a wide range of industries and sectors. These ideas are discussed with executives to obtain managerial insights. Our studies reveal that laggards who generate new ideas (i.e. lag-users) can enrich NPD. Being coached through the systematic Lag-User Method, they can come up with radical, really new, or incremental innovations. Moreover, applying the method increased laggards' perception regarding their (a) understanding of innovation, (b) perception that people can learn to innovate, (c) perception of their ability to develop new products on their own, (d) confidence about their own new ideas, and (e) perception of considering themselves capable of innovating. Thus, we propose that by involving lag-users in idea generation and NPD process, both academia and firms can improve the effectiveness of NPD, overcome barriers to adoption of innovations, cross the chasm, and accelerate the diffusion of their new products or services.

Social media technologies allow user-generated content and provide new opportunities and challenges for firms to transform their business. In particular, more and more firms have started strategically using the online user innovation communities (OUICs) for open innovation initiatives. The extent to which firms are able to derive business value from OUICs, however, has not been systematically examined. Drawing on a multi-theoretical foundation from the framework of dynamic capabilities and the view of innovation value chain, we conceptualize two OUIC-enabled capabilities, which are, ideation capability related to collecting user-generated ideas about potential innovation from OUIC, and implementation capability related to selecting user-generated ideas for innovation development and introducing developed innovation via OUIC. Using a large-scale panel data set consisting of 1676 firm-day observations from Dell and Starbucks, we examine the impacts of OUIC-enabled capabilities on firm value. We find robust evidence that OUIC-enabled ideation capability actually does not influence firm value, whereas OUIC-enabled implementation capability increases firm value. Novel theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;Ref112
This study investigates the effects of the use of social media in inbound open innovation on capabilities for absorptive capacity of companies. Seven explorative case studies were conducted in an R&D and business context of two large global high-tech companies. The results suggest that if the necessary conditions are met, social media usage increases the transparent, moderational and multi-directional interactions that in turn influence four capabilities for absorptive capacity: connectedness, socialization tactics, cross-functionality and receptivity, a hitherto overlooked capability. Hence, we observe that social media are boundary-spanning tools that can be used to build and increase companies' absorptive capacity.;Ref113
"Purpose - The internal resources of a firm should not be regarded as the only source of innovation; organizations need to look at the external sources which can contribute greatly. This can happen through the recent development in technologies and the emergence of social media; such advancements have empowered consumers to have social interaction with their peers in online communities. As a source of generation of innovative ideas, company-based communities have not received enough attention, although they are strong drivers for co-creation of value by customers. Easy online communication channels, facilitated through online communities, have developed open innovation as an attractive means of customer involvement in value creation. However, literature in this area is devoid of empirical research on the way consumers can participate in open innovation communities using Web 2.0 technologies. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper, therefore, looks at the opportunities offered by social media to firms for open innovation in the context of new product development (NPD). The study is based on social support theory and the concept of social media generating open innovation; a model for the research has thus been proposed. The model has been tested using partial least square through an online questionnaire. Findings - The results indicate that social media is a cost-efficient way for firms to look at external sources of innovation, specifically in NPD. Online communities, developed specifically for new products, can support the innovation process for the business sector. The paper discusses the results of this empirical research and has some practical implications for practitioners in this field. Originality/value - The study indicate that social media empower individuals to come online, get involved in social interaction and share their experiences about a new product with other peers in the network. Social media and informational support, as social capital of online communities, both have influence on participation of individuals in the online communities of open innovation for NPD.";Ref114
"Organizational practices that foster a dialogic relationship between organizations and their constituent customers have created an arena for inbound and outbound innovation. At the nexus of this development occurring in the media industries, these flows are carried by various forms of digital, social media and an increasing digital presence in the form of dynamic websites with varying degrees of interactive capabilities. In this paper, we posit that the newspaper industry is torn between indifference and cautious apprehension caused by the difficulty in marrying the journalism profession's carefully guarded gatekeeping practices with the revolving doors of open innovation. Gatekeeping has emerged as a fiercely defended cornerstone for the industry and the profession of journalism itself is not enough to distinguish amateurs from professionals; for the segregation between professionals and amateurs to carry weight rather than being reduced to a hollow title, the segregation needs a practice that explicitly enforces gatekeeping-where actions speak louder than titles. Against this backdrop, we pursue the following research question: Why has IT-enabled open innovation become such a contentious issue in the context of the newspaper industry? Combining contextual in-situ ethnographic interviews and observation with an industry-wide content analysis of Swedish newspaper websites, we present an in-depth view of what IT-enabled open innovation means in the context of the newspaper industry. Results show that the process of legitimization inscribed by a particularly charged information technology-the printing press-continues to exert great influence in what constitutes open practice in the newspaper industry.";Ref115
As various forms of social media are spreading, we often witness that an idea of an individual user drives macroscopic changes. From the perspectives of product development and marketing, the opinions left by potential consumers in online social network can generate big ripple effects. This study analyzes the user opinions in online space to grasp preferences toward various products psychologically categorized by users. We also suggest an aspect of the market mentally configured by users using network modeling while following the framework of economic sociology. Existing analyses on online market place are mainly dealing with structural issues such as inter-actor relationships and status measurement. This study, however, analyzes complex preferences regarding diverse products and brands and derives a new model for inter-market connections. We expect that our study will provide important consequences on digital marketing and community design of corporations planning word of mouth effect in online space.;Ref116
Despite the exponential rise of social media use in external stakeholder engagement academic research and managerial practice have paid little attention to how it can be used for open innovation across the entire innovation funnel, spanning ideation, R&D, and commercialization. As a result there is little understanding of how companies can organize for and implement social media for open innovation. Utilizing a multiple case study design, this article examines its application across the entire innovation process. It proposes a range of organizational and technological adaptations that managers can implement to ensure they realize the innovative benefits of social media application.;Ref117
This paper analyzes organizations' attempts to entice external contributors to submit suggestions for future organizational action. While earlier work has elaborated on the advantages of leveraging the knowledge of external contributors, our findings show that organizational attempts to attract such involvement are likely to wither and die. We develop arguments about what increases the likelihood of getting suggestions from externals in the future, namely through (1) proactive attention (submitting internally developed suggestions to externals to stimulate debate) and (2) reactive attention (paying attention to suggestions from externals to signal they are being listened to), particularly when those suggestions are submitted by newcomers. Findings from an analysis of about 24,000 initiatives by organizations to involve external contributors suggest these actions are crucial for receiving suggestions from external contributors. Our results are contingent upon the stage of the initiative because organizations' actions exert more influence in initiatives that lack a history of prior suggestions. Our work has implications for scholars of open innovation because it highlights the importance of considering failures as well successes: focusing exclusively on initiatives that reach a certain stage can lead to partial or erroneous conclusions about why some organizations engage external contributors while others fail.

As many futurists have argued, images of the future have a crucial role to play in societal development. At an individual level, the understanding of people's hopes, fears and expectations becomes important not only to determine how we look at the future but also to understand our present actions. At a collective level, sharing these images and understanding our role within the community is also essential for the development of a shared vision about the future. Young people stand out as one of main players in this task of building the society of the future, which is why investigating their images of the future should have highly significant implications. The present paper shows the results of a comparative pilot study about the images of the future found among youngsters from 2 different European countries: Spain and Finland. The survey-which involved two groups of university students from the aforesaid countries-has as its main aim to look into the identified cultural values and message sources that can influence the way in which we look at the (expected and desired) future. The importance of this project, which was developed using the web platform www.F212.org-a pilot project funded by FECYT (Spanish initials for Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology)-stems from the idea that the communication and exchange of information about images of the future through social networks will empower new generations to cope with the challenge of building a desired future.;Ref119
Results of Product Development and Management Association (PDMA)'s Comparative Performance Assessment Study are presented from 453 companies. In addition to baseline questions from previous studies, new sections on culture, social media, services, sustainability, open innovation, and global product development practices are introduced. Extensive comparison between the best performing companies and the rest of the sample reveal numerous practices that lead to higher product performance in the market. Comparisons are also made between this study and previous PDMA best practices studies. In addition, geographic differences among North America, Europe, and Asia are explored. Practices leading to higher commercial performance are identified.;Ref120
This paper explores and explains the emergence of commercial blogging. Studying the contents of 18 of Sweden's top fashion blogs, our findings suggest that bloggers create value by generating improved transaction efficiencies. Fashion bloggers have high credibility and thus facilitate the flow of consumer information and choice. The blogs present a combination of private and commercial content, thereby creating a customer intimacy that differentiates them from more traditional market channels. The value of these relationships is appropriated partly through advertisements and partly from other sources of revenue, such as the creation of brands and online stores. Bloggers have become powerful intermediaries who often have a better contact with end consumers than fashion firms. This paper therefore suggests that management of the blogosphere is an emerging source of competitive advantage for fashion firms.;Ref121
