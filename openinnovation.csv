Papadopoulos T., Stamati T., Nikolaidou M., Anagnostopoulos D.;From open source to open innovation practices: A case in the greek context in light of the debt crisis;2013;"""Open"" practices have been at the forefront of research, business and political agendas for some time. Traditionally, research has focused on analysing critical factors for the deployment of Open Source (OS) Software and has highlighted the roles of ""Collective Intelligence"" and ""participation in voluntary communities"" in facilitating OS development. Nevertheless, there is little literature examining the role these Open Innovation (OI) practices may play in influencing the private-collective model of innovation and its application in economies-in-crisis to create public-good innovations. To address this gap, this paper uses the case of Greece. Data were gathered from interviews conducted with public policy makers and private sector top executives. The findings underline the importance of using OS as software to deal with cost reduction during debt crisis; but more importantly reveal a shift from OS to utilising the aforementioned OI practices to support the creation of public-good innovations through the private-collective model of innovation, and the difficulties faced in encouraging this initiative due to insufficient national innovation policy, and different philosophies, structures, and cultures followed by the organisations.

Yoon S., Jeong S.;Effects to implement the open-innovation coordinative strategies between manufacturer and retailer in reverse supply chain;2017;A reverse supply chain, as a post-consumption activity, aims at extracting value from products at end of their life cycle (Mafakher and Nasiri, Journal of Cleaner Production 59: 185-196, 2013). As well, company's awareness is attracting increasing attention toward sustainable business practices. Open-innovation is a typical example of coordinative activity that a manufacturer should share a profits generated through reverse supply chain with retailer. The aim of this paper provide insights toward open innovation practice in sharing profits between two strategic partners, manufacturer and retailer to maximize an individual profits as well as total profits concurrently in reverse supply chain. For analyzing effects of open innovation strategies, we modeled reverse supply chain environments using system dynamics approach and compared the gap of profits between non-coordinative (decentralized) and coordinative activity. Three cooperative contracts in terms of how to share the cost and profit between two parties are proposed in this paper. Each contract was analyzed according to the following three contract processes. The first stage is that manufacturer proposes contracts to retailer. The second is that retailer evaluates proposed contracts and choices the best contract which can lead to maximize its expected profit. Finally retailer and manufacturer adjust parameters of the best contract for achieving mutual goal of supply chain.

Kim J., Choi S.O.;"The intensity of organizational change and the perception of organizational innovativeness; with discussion on open innovation";2020;Each individual member of an organization must recognize and lead innovation, which can be affected by human resource development (HRD) investments and organizational changes. In this study, we aimed to verify how HRD investment at the individual level relates to employee perceptions of organizational innovativeness and to examine how the intensity of organizational change, a situational factor at the organizational level, affects the relationship between HRD investment and employee perceptions of organizational innovativeness through multilevel analysis using hierarchical linear models. We performed an analysis based on the responses from5184 workers and 125 companies where corporate-level and personal-level data were matched in a Human Capital Corporate Panel (HCCP) survey. HRDinvestment by employees was shown to increase the perception of organizational innovativeness. The results demonstrated that the intensity of organizational change moderated the relationship between HRD investment and the perception of organizational innovativeness. However, the stronger the organizational change intensity, the weaker the positive effect of HRD investment on the perception of organizational innovativeness. Finally, we presented theoretical and practical implications and further research tasks related to the HRD of corporations and open innovation. © 2020 by the authors.;Each individual member of an organization must recognize and lead innovation, which can be affected by human resource development (HRD) investments and organizational changes.

Shearmur R., Doloreux D.;How open innovation processes vary between urban and remote environments: slow innovators, market-sourced information and frequency of interaction;2016;Geographic research on firm-level innovation is generally premised on the idea of open innovation, suggesting that innovation occurs more readily in urban settings or clusters, which generate local buzz and allow access to external actors. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that firms also introduce first-to-market innovations in remote locations. In this exploratory paper, building upon work by Philip McCann, we outline a conceptual framework that connects innovators (differentiated by information source and frequency of interaction with interlocutors) and location (distance from a metropolitan area): slow innovators, relying on non-market-sourced information and infrequent contacts, will be overrepresented in isolated locations. Fast innovators, relying on market-sourced information and frequent interactions, will locate closer to cities. Our results confirm this. Our interpretation of these results – slow innovators are more reliant on technological information which loses value more slowly than faster decaying market-oriented information – requires further investigation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Geographic research on firm-level innovation is generally premised on the idea of Open Innovation, suggesting that innovation occurs more readily in urban settings or clusters, which generate local buzz and allow access to external actors.

All this requires a new open innovation approach, which means that stakeholders from regional administrations, hospitals, companies and intermediate organisations openly work together towards commonly identified global and regional digital health goals. Although both practice and theory have proven that the open innovation approach is beneficial for companies and end-users, there is still a need for increased understanding of what leads to the success of digital health related to regional competitiveness through the implementation of policies based on people-centred open innovation. This study is a longitudinal case study in which open innovation ecosystem partners (including challengers (healthcare organisation representatives), solvers (companies), funders (policy organisations) and supporters (intermediate organisations) were monitored and analysed in three countries. The focus of the paper is to explore a digital health open innovation ecosystem over the years. The results show that the created demand-driven open innovation model can be used to strengthen the governance of digital health, and to improve communication density and knowledge transfer between the ecosystem actors. The new model is a useful way to make funding structures clearer and to improve the people centricity of digital health solutions.

Lessons for open innovation from an exploratory examination of the supposedly democratic-anarchic nature of Wikipedia;2010;Accounts of open source software (OSS) development projects frequently stress their democratic, sometimes even anarchic nature, in contrast to for-profit organisations. Given this observation, our research evaluates qualitative data from Wikipedia, a free online encyclopaedia whose development mechanism allegedly resembles that of OSS projects. Our research offers contributions to the field of open innovation research with three major findings. First, we shed light on Wikipedia as a phenomenon that has received scant attention from management scholars to date. Second, we show that OSS-related motivational mechanisms partially apply to Wikipedia participants. Third, our exploration of Wikipedia also reveals that its organisational mechanisms are often perceived as bureaucratic by contributors. This finding was unexpected since this type of problem is often associated with for-profit organisations. Such a situation risks attenuating the motivation of contributors and sheds a critical light on the nature of Wikipedia as a role model for open innovation processes.

Thus, this study aims to analyse international publications on the activity-based costing system in recent years, identifying trends in evolution and future research opportunities. Based on bibliometric techniques, the outputs obtained in theWeb of Science (n = 752) and Scopus (n = 1107) databases were analysed in bibliometrix R package to make a systematic mapping and review of the literature. After removing duplicates, we obtained a final output of 1419 articles. The analysis of these publications points to a growing trend in the publication of articles on ABC, highlighting publications in partnership and their dispersion in magazines from different areas.

Cui T., Wu Y., Tong Y.;Exploring ideation and implementation openness in open innovation projects: IT-enabled absorptive capacity perspective;2018;Advancements in information technology (IT) have made organizational boundaries so porous, thereby resulting in a trend toward leveraging external knowledge for innovation. However, firms experience significant obstacles in drawing external knowledge. This study aims to disentangle the role of IT-enabled absorptive capacity in new product development performance. The research model was tested with survey data of open innovation projects from 152 firms. Our findings indicate that IT-enabled absorptive capability improves open innovation project performance in terms of new product innovativeness and product speed to market, but we do not detect a significant direct influence of openness on performance. Our findings also show that the interaction of IT-enabled absorptive capacity and ideation openness significantly amplifies new product innovativeness while the interaction of IT-enabled absorptive capacity and implementation openness accelerates the product speed to market. This study theoretically contributes by building an IT-enabled absorptive capacity theory in the open innovation context and uncovering the effects of two dimensions of openness. In practice, it offers managers strategies to successfully conduct open innovation projects in deploying effective ITs and leveraging various types of openness during the two phases. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;Advancements in information technology (IT) have made organizational boundaries so porous, thereby resulting in a trend toward leveraging external knowledge for innovation. However, firms experience significant obstacles in drawing external knowledge. This study aims to disentangle the role of IT-enabled absorptive capacity in new product development performance. The research model was tested with survey data of Open Innovation projects from 152 firms. Our findings indicate that IT-enabled absorptive capability improves Open Innovation project performance in terms of new product innovativeness and product speed to market, but we do not detect a significant direct influence of openness on performance.

Alexy O., Bascavusoglu-Moreau E., Salter A.J.;Toward an aspiration-level theory of open innovation;2016;Although open innovation has become increasingly established in the management literature, comprehensive theoretical explanations of what drives firms to be open are sparse. Taking the perspective of the behavioral theory of the firm, we conceive of open innovation as a form of nonlocal search, arguing that firms will turn to open innovation when substantially under- or over-performing relative to their aspirations. We further enquire how this relationship is moderated by firm-specific innovation-related resources: human capital, research and development investment, and patents.

Suh Y., Jeon J.;Monitoring patterns of open innovation using the patent-based brokerage analysis;2019;As the paradigm of open innovation continues to proliferate in both academia and practice especially for the last decade, many studies have attempted to investigate patterns of open innovation. However, empirical and quantitative approaches to monitoring the patterns of open innovation are less conducted because of the difficulty in data collection and the lack of effective methods. Also, it is difficult to identify the patterns of open innovation when there are many cases of open innovation in a wide range of technology areas. In this respect, this paper aims to quantitatively monitor the patterns of open innovation using the patent-based brokerage analysis in the case of mobile communications technology. Using patent citation information, the knowledge flow between technology fields and firms is identified, especially for structuring the open innovation network of 5G technology. Then, the patent-based brokerage analysis based on the open innovation network is conducted to extract brokerage patents that present the patterns of open innovation: inbound and outbound innovation. Furthermore, the brokerage firms are explored to recommend the partnerships in the open innovation network. According to the results, it is expected that “strategy for open innovation dynamics” is systematically formulated based on the brokerage patents and partners in various technology areas. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;As the paradigm of Open Innovation continues to proliferate in both academia and practice especially for the last decade, many studies have attempted to investigate patterns of Open Innovation.

In this respect, this paper aims to quantitatively monitor the patterns of Open Innovation using the patent-based brokerage analysis in the case of mobile communications technology. Using patent citation information, the knowledge flow between technology fields and firms is identified, especially for structuring the Open Innovation network of 5G technology. Then, the patent-based brokerage analysis based on the Open Innovation network is conducted to extract brokerage patents that present the patterns of Open Innovation: inbound and outbound innovation. Furthermore, the brokerage firms are explored to recommend the partnerships in the Open Innovation network. According to the results, it is expected that “strategy for Open Innovation dynamics” is systematically formulated based on the brokerage patents and partners in various technology areas. ;10.1016/j.techfore.2018.01.037;2-s2.0-85042865975;South Korea;"Business, Management and Accounting; Psychology";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Dodgson M., Gann D., Salter A.;The role of technology in the shift towards open innovation: The case of Procter & Gamble;2006;As with all new ideas, the concept of Open Innovation requires extensive empirical investigation, testing and development. This paper analyzes Procter and Gamble's 'Connect and Develop' strategy as a case study of the major organizational and technological changes associated with open innovation. It argues that although some of the organizational changes accompanying open innovation are beginning to be described in the literature, more analysis is warranted into the ways technological changes have facilitated open innovation strategies, particularly related to new product development. Information and communications technologies enable the exchange of distributed sources of information in the open innovation process. The case study shows that furthermore a suite of new technologies for data mining, simulation, prototyping and visual representation, what we call 'innovation technology', help to support open innovation in Procter and Gamble. The paper concludes with a suggested research agenda for furthering understanding of the role played by and consequences of this technology. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;As with all new ideas, the concept of Open Innovation requires extensive empirical investigation, testing and development.

Müller-Seitz G., Reger G.;Is open source software living up to its promises? insights for open innovation management from two open source software-inspired projects;2009;At present, several virtual initiatives claim to be acting according to the open source software (OSS) arena, which is often deemed a role model for open innovation. Against this background, this research focuses on a comparative case study of two non-profit project networks that attempt to operate in line with the OSS phenomenon: Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, and the development of an automobile, Open Source car. We show that many parallels to the OSS arena can be drawn in both cases. However, this analysis must be performed cautiously, as several factors limit the applicability of OSS principles to non-software-related arenas.

Qiu P., Zhou Z., Kim D.-J.;A new path of sustainable development in traditional agricultural areas from the perspective of open innovation—a coupling and coordination study on the agricultural industry and the tourism industry;2021;Background/Objective: The Chinese government is actively developing the rural economy and promoting the poverty alleviation campaign. The economic development of the traditional agricultural areas is essential to people’s basic livelihood and social stability. The tourism industry has been proven to be an effective approach to promote the regional economy. It has become a hot issue as to how to develop the tourism industry in rural areas. Methods/Statistical Analysis: Based on a corresponding index system, a coupling coordination model was established to explore the coupling and coordination development of the agricultural industry and the tourism industry in Henan province, a traditional agricultural area in China. Findings: The result revealed that although the coupling degree between the agricultural and the tourism industry from the year of 2009 to 2018 is relatively stable, the coordination degree shows a continuous rising trend from 0.278 to 0.921. This indicated that the agricultural industry and the tourism industry in Henan province continues to interact with and influence each other, and the comprehensive development level and the coordination degree of the two industries have been constantly improved. Implications: From the result, it can be seen that the integration development of the agricultural industry and the tourism industry could be a new path to develop the economy of rural areas. From the perspective of sustainable development, suggestions are proposed to optimize the agricultural industrial structure, extend tourism industry chain and construct support policy to develop a sustainable mode of the agricultural industry and the tourism industry. © 2021 by the authors.

Delves M., Lafuente-Monasterio M.J., Upton L., Ruecker A., Leroy D., Gamo F.-J., Sinden R.;Fueling Open Innovation for Malaria Transmission-Blocking Drugs: Hundreds of Molecules Targeting Early Parasite Mosquito Stages;2019;"Background: Despite recent successes at controlling malaria, progress has stalled with an estimated 219 million cases and 435,000 deaths in 2017 alone. Combined with emerging resistance to front line antimalarial therapies in Southeast Asia, there is an urgent need for new treatment options and novel approaches to halt the spread of malaria. Plasmodium, the parasite responsible for malaria propagates through mosquito transmission. This imposes an acute bottleneck on the parasite population and transmission-blocking interventions exploiting this vulnerability are recognized as vital for malaria elimination. Methods: 13,533 small molecules with known activity against Plasmodium falciparum asexual parasites were screened for additional transmission-blocking activity in an ex vivo Plasmodium berghei ookinete development assay. Active molecules were then counterscreened in dose response against HepG2 cells to determine their activity/cytotoxicity window and selected non-toxic representative molecules were fully profiled in a range of transmission and mosquito infection assays. Furthermore, the entire dataset was compared to other published screens of the same molecules against P. falciparum gametocytes and female gametogenesis. Results: 437 molecules inhibited P. berghei ookinete formation with an IC50 &lt; 10 μM. of which 273 showed &gt;10-fold parasite selectivity compared to activity against HepG2 cells. Active molecules grouped into 49 chemical clusters of three or more molecules, with 25 doublets and 94 singletons. Six molecules representing six major chemical scaffolds confirmed their transmission-blocking activity against P. falciparum male and female gametocytes and inhibited P. berghei oocyst formation in the standard membrane feeding assay at 1 μM. When screening data in the P. berghei development ookinete assay was compared to published screens of the same library in assays against P. falciparum gametocytes and female gametogenesis, it was established that each assay identified distinct, but partially overlapping subsets of transmission-blocking molecules. However, selected molecules unique to each assay show transmission-blocking activity in mosquito transmission assays. Conclusion: The P. berghei ookinete development assay is an excellent high throughput assay for efficiently identifying antimalarial molecules targeting early mosquito stage parasite development. Currently no high throughput transmission-blocking assay is capable of identifying all transmission-blocking molecules. © Copyright © 2019 Delves, Lafuente-Monasterio, Upton, Ruecker, Leroy, Gamo and Sinden.";"Background: Despite recent successes at controlling malaria, progress has stalled with an estimated 219 million cases and 435,000 deaths in 2017 alone.

"Saguy, S; Taoukis, PS";From open innovation to enginomics: Paradigm shifts;2017;Background: Food engineering is at a crossroads. Inertia, combined with diminishing research funding, declining new academic positions, combined with disruptive and emerging competitive adjacent domains have a heavy toll on the field and its attractiveness for talented faculty members and students. The proliferation and flourishing of many bio-disciplines highlight the acute need for food engineering profession to revise its vision, strategy and missions and to reinvigorate and expand its horizon. Open innovation is a concept developed for commercial applications for gaining competitive advantages. Open innovation is based on utilizing both external and internal ideas and open channels for accessing and employing knowledge and solutions. Open innovation main philosophy should be adopted to integrate, assimilate and synergize food engineering core fundamental principles and to build on the accelerating developments in emerging knowledge, science and technology. Scope and approach: To fully benefit from the vast future emerging opportunities, food engineering is faced with a plethora of demanding challenges (e.g., new curricula, innovation ecosystem, partnerships, creativity, multidisciplinary, entrepreneurship, sustainability, food and nutrition security, population growth, health and wellness, nutrition, bioavailability). 'Enginomics' (engineering + omics) - a new term coined to express some of the major food engineering future challenges that holistically combines food processing and human internal digestion. It calls for studying human internal transport phenomena, utilization of new techniques (e.g., micro-processing, virtualization) for modelling and simulation, emerging topics (e.g., bioavailability, signaling, satiety, personalized nutrigenomics, targeting, pro- and prebiotics, nanotechnology, biotechnology), as well as traditional food and product engineering. Key findings and conclusions: The food engineering domain should rise to future mounting challenges and opportunities by redefining its vision and strategy recapturing its significant roles, and stopping the loss of its graduates in the competitions with other fields. Several paradigm shifts are recommended including reinventing its curricula in pursuing of excellence with a start-up-university (innoversity) mentality, new mindset for promoting open innovation, implementing virtualization, embracing enginomics and social responsibility. As a part of enginomics and health and wellness, the development of low cost, fast and accurate bioavailability tests is required.

Methods: In order to comprehend empirically what really means ""demand articulation"", i.e., how ""market-driving"" is different from ""market-driven,"" we conducted a quantitative analysis of market growth paths in three different kinds of product categories.

Shi X., Zhang Q.;Network inertia and inbound open innovation: is there a bidirectional relationship?;2020;Based on the patent data collected from smartphone industry over the period 2000–2017, we utilize two-stage least squares to investigate the bidirectional relationship between network inertia and inbound open innovation practices. Furthermore, our research is of great benefit to better understanding of the interplay of network reach and network centrality on network inertia and inbound open innovation, and the moderating effects of network centrality on the reciprocal relationship between network inertia and inbound open innovation practice. The empirical results confirm that there is a bidirectional relationship between network inertia and inbound open innovation, and network centrality shows the moderating effect on the above relationship. Moreover, network centrality moderates the positive effects of network reach on network inertia and inbound open innovation. These findings suggest that network centrality and network reach are important factors of the firms’ network inertia and inbound open innovation. The results of the models in this paper suggest that firms with higher network inertia in the innovation networks are less likely to search for sources outside their boundary.

Nevertheless, its collection is not an activity disseminated among Portuguese beekeepers, as its production is marginal. There are limited empirical studies on the production and the technical aspects involved in this type of activity. Our study, therefore, contributes to narrowing this knowledge gap, by analyzing and comparing the productivity and profitability of two bee venom collection techniques. The first involves equipment available on the market, and the second involves a new device developed from the aim of the present work. Concerning market knowledge, a questionnaire was given to a sample of beekeepers, to understand and characterize the market's needs and the level of information about bee venom. Because of the growing market interest in this product, a new collector is proposed, based on a set of intensive frame collectors strategically placed inside the beehives. The improvements obtained were increased production, either in terms of quantity or quality, obtaining a positive profitability. To evaluate the productivity of the proposed equipment, a comparison was performed, in an apiary, between existing state-of-the-art equipment and the proposed intensive collector. In a second stage, the profitability of the new proposed equipment was analyzed, using a comparative method between incomes and costs associated with both solutions.

"Bertello, A; Bogers, MLAM; De Bernardi, P";Open innovation in the face of the COVID-19 grand challenge: insights from the Pan-European hackathon 'EUvsVirus';2021;Being a grand challenge of global scale, the COVID-19 pandemic requires collective and collaborative efforts from a variety of actors to enable the expected scientific advancement and technological progress. To achieve such an open innovation approach, several initiatives have been launched in order to leverage potential distributed knowledge sources that go beyond those available to any single organization. A particular tool that has gained some momentum during COVID-19 times is hackathons, which have been used to unleash the innovation potential of individuals who voluntarily came together, for a relatively short period of time, with the aim to solve specific problems. In this paper, we describe and analyze the case of the hackathon EUvsVirus, led by the European Innovation Council. EUvs Virus was a 3-day online hackathon to connect civil society, innovators, partners, and investors across Europe and beyond in order to develop innovative solutions to coronavirus-related challenges. We have identified four dimensions to explore hackathons as a crowdsourcing tool for practicing effective open innovation in the face of COVID-19: broad scope, participatory architecture, online setting, and community creation. We discuss how these four elements can play a strategic role in the face of grand challenges, which require, as in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, both urgent action and long-term thinking. Our case analysis also suggests the need to look beyond the 'usual suspects', through knowledge recombination with atypical resources (e.g., retired experts, graduate students, and the general public). On this basis, we call for a broader perspective on open innovation, to be extended beyond openness across organizational boundaries, and to explore the role of openness at societal level.;Being a grand challenge of global scale, the COVID-19 pandemic requires collective and collaborative efforts from a variety of actors to enable the expected scientific advancement and technological progress.

Ferrary M.;Specialized organizations and ambidextrous clusters in the open innovation paradigm;2011;By comparing Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems over twenty years, one illustrates that a firm that outsources exploration through an Acquisition and Development (A&D) strategy of start-ups and exploitation specialization can be more innovative and competitive than an ambidextrous organization. The success of an A&D strategy depends on the embeddedness of the firm in the network of organizations comprised of an open innovation system and supported by an inter-organizational process of innovation. The embeddedness of Cisco Systems in the ambidextrous high-tech cluster of the Silicon Valley, especially its ties to venture capital firms and start-ups, explains the success of its A&D strategy. The spreading of A&D strategy among large firms reinforces the dynamics of the open innovation system and nurtures the cluster's ambidexterity by increasing incentives for other organizations and individuals of the network to explore new knowledge and create fresh start-ups. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.;By comparing Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems over twenty years, one illustrates that a firm that outsources exploration through an Acquisition and Development (A&D) strategy of start-ups and exploitation specialization can be more innovative and competitive than an ambidextrous organization.

Wang Y., Roijakkers N., Vanhaverbeke W., Chen J.;How Chinese firms employ open innovation to strengthen their innovative performance;2012;China became the second-largest economy behind the USA in 2010. While there is quite some macroeconomic research documenting the technological catching-up of China as a nation, there is only little research studying how individual Chinese firms are catching up. This paper draws on the open innovation perspective to explore how Chinese firms improve their innovative performance. Our empirical analysis is based on a sample of 91 native Chinese firms in high-tech industries. The results indicate that Chinese firms widely implement an open innovation approach to strengthen their innovative performance. These firms use: 1 technology in-licensing agreements to obtain access to technologies 2 long-term alliances with foreign partners to access state-of-the-art technologies 3 collaboration with local universities and R&D institutes to broaden their technological strengths 4 collaboration with the local industrial community to deepen their technological skills.

In this context, we study the international impact of innovations from specific countries. Based on panel data of patents from 27 countries over 17 years, we find that levels of open innovation, technological complexity, and dominant design influence the international impact of innovations from a country. Contrary to earlier research, however, this influence is negative when open innovation activities are involved. This is particularly relevant in the context of Chinese innovation, in which the same innovation networks that promote efficient production may hinder the development of innovations. Due to the innate uncertainty and newness of innovation, partners beyond the common local and long-term networks must be included. Hence, to effectively create a New Silk Road of Innovation, innovation ecosystems may need to expand across national borders. This opens up fruitful avenues for future research, and individuals with multiple cultural identities can bridge the gaps between contexts.;Chinese innovation is again flowing westwards, which is fomented by China's Belt and Road Initiative.

In this regard, the open innovation model seems to provide efficient support for the involvement of private firms in public collaborations, by ensuring that there is efficiency and affordability in the delivery of new and 'smart' city services. This inquiry aims to fill a gap in the main field of research: only a very few studies have tried to analyse the challenges encountered, and the strategies followed, by firms developing open innovation strategies with public partners in Smart City Projects (SCPs). In trying to fill this gap, exploratory and qualitative analysis was performed on the decision-making processes of multinational companies participating in SCPs. This study uses a multiple-case research method, based on 21 in-depth semi-structured interviews with the smart city managers of seven large multinational companies. With reference to and in line with these cases, interesting predictions emerge relating to public-private collaborations and the creation of different forms of explorative and exploitative project alliances in cities. In particular, companies that develop alliances with public partners consider the open innovation model to be a testbed for future technologies and the development of products and services, by supporting positive knowledge spill-oven that reduce the technological gap between the private and the public sector and-at the same time-stimulating the development of a smart city ecosystem when firms are looking for the cross-fertilization of ideas.

Measurement strategy requires feasible variables that make up those goals. This strategy also ensures that all variables that are important in measuring contribute to the larger goals. A useful way to assess and explain the effectiveness of the technology transfer office (TTO) of universities is to model this within a production function/frontier framework.

This study presents evidence on the relative efficiency of research commercialization in the university through the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. The implication of the DEA efficiency result is to derive the efficiency level of the TTO's strategy from the observed performance. It also helps in identifying the benchmarking of other TTOs, which would be valuable information for improving their new technology commercialization strategy. In detail, a benchmark is provided to improve the weakness of strategy and resource allocation of a poorly performing TTO. The proposed matrix of indicators is an exploit of how performance could be measured within the decision-making units that have been chosen.

Chen J., Zhao X., Wang Y.;A new measurement of intellectual capital and its impact on innovation performance in an open innovation paradigm;2015;Companies have traditionally considered innovation an internal process, and accordingly, they have relied on their internal intellectual capital. However, this closed innovation strategy has, in recent years, been superseded by an open innovation strategy. The existing measurement model of intellectual capital, which is concerned mainly with an internal dimension, is no longer appropriate for open innovation practice. To address this challenge, this paper reconstructs the measurement model of intellectual capital, expanding the concept to include both internal and external dimensions, both of which have the same three elements: human, structural, and relationship capital. To test the reliability and validity of this new model, we explore the impact of each element on innovation performance through an empirical study of 149 companies in China, and we find that all elements of internal and external intellectual capital have a significantly positive impact on innovation performance. This implies that our new measurement is appropriate for firms with an increasing degree of openness for innovation.

This integrative, innovative CR requires the implementation of three recommendations: start the change process now, fine-tune along the way; create a new marketing/CR department; and educate and professionalize. These recommendations provide the blueprint for jump-starting the process and call for immediate actions to deal with the severity of the crises facing the CR profession.

"Pullen, AJJ; de Weerd-Nederhof, PC; Groen, AJ; Fisscher, OAM";Open Innovation in Practice: Goal Complementarity and Closed NPD Networks to Explain Differences in Innovation Performance for SMEs in the Medical Devices Sector;2012;Cooperation with other organizations increases the innovation performance of organization, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they encounter liabilities of smallness (e.g., limited financial resources, and manpower). In the medical devices sector, collaboration with external partners for NPD becomes increasingly important due to the complexity of the products and the development process. About 80% of companies in this sector are SMEs. These companies operate in a highly regulated sector, which affects the organization of the external network required for the new product development (NPD) process. SMEs are practicing extensively open innovation activities, but in practice face a number of barriers in trying to apply open innovation. This paper examines multiple network characteristics simultaneously in relation to innovation performance and thereby aligns with and builds further on configuration theory. Configuration theory posits that for each set of network characteristics, there exists an ideal set of organizational characteristics that yields superior performance. In this research, the systems approach to fit is used. Fit is high to the extent that an organization is similar to an ideal profile along multiple dimensions. This ideal profile represents the network profile that the 15% highest performing companies use. It is argued that the smaller the distance between the ideal profile and the network profile that is used, the higher the performance. The objective of this research is (1) to examine the relation between the ideal profile and innovation performance and (2) to examine which organization of the network profile is related to high innovation performance. Quantitative survey data (n?=?60, response rate 61.9%) form the core of this research. The quantitative results are clarified and have been triangulated with qualitative interview data (n?=?50). Our findings suggest the presence of an ideal NPD network profile (in terms of goal complementarity, resource complementarity, fairness trust, reliability trust, and network position strength): the more a company's NPD network profile differs from this ideal profile, the lower the innovation performance. In addition, the results of our study indicate that the NPD network profiles of successful and less successful SMEs in the medical devices sector significantly differ in terms of goal complementarity, while this is less the case for trust and resource complementarity labeled distinctive by previous research. Finally, results show that a relatively closed, focused, and consistent business-like NPD networking approach, which is characterized by result orientation and professionalism, is related to high innovation performance. It is recommended that SMEs in the medical devices sector aiming to distinguish themselves from competitors in terms of innovation performance focus on goal complementarity while adopting such a business-like attitude toward their NPD network partners.;Cooperation with other organizations increases the innovation performance of organization, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they encounter liabilities of smallness (e.g., limited financial resources, and manpower).

Richter N., Jackson P., Schildhauer T.;Outsourcing creativity: An abductive study of open innovation using corporate accelerators;2018;Corporate accelerators are organizational devices designed to bring together innovative new ventures and startups with specialist knowledge and creativity with the experience and funding of established companies. The main goal for the use of an accelerator program by an established corporation is to open up the innovation process and actively profit from the innovative capacity of new ventures. However, until now there has been little empirical investigation of the characteristics of this particular model of “open innovation”. This paper outlines the key features of corporate accelerator programs and presents empirical data on their characteristics. The existing literature generally reflects positive results from this form of innovation but displays a lack of empirically and theoretically grounded research of how accelerator programs work.

Polyakova A.;Civil service, hr potential, and open innovation;2020;Countries strive to upgrade their civil service quality in many directions, thus responding to major contemporary challenges and following the trends of open innovation. The 2030 civil servant will require a wide set of soft and hard skills that are not common among the today’s public administrators but are attributable to young people. The following questions then arise: Will the demand for qualified civil servants be reduced because of optimization of public administration processes? How significant is the demand for young people by the civil service? Is civil service attractive as a vector of career development among young people? The research objective is to provide quantity estimates of the Russian civil service’s hiring potential and to match that potential with young people’s attitude towards public administration employment. Using the panel regression, regions that can expand the civil service staff were identified and the necessary preconditions and policies to take use of this potential were indicated.

For this reason, they seek technological competitiveness and improvement of their innovation activities. In this context, open innovation and eco-innovation are important elements to achieve these goals. With this background, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between technological capability, open innovation, and eco-innovation in corporate performance, testing a structural equation model using SmartPLS in a sample of 684 small and medium-sized companies in Mexico. The main results show that technological capability significantly influences open innovation and eco-innovation practices, not directly in corporate performance, but through open innovation or eco-innovation. Our results also confirm the positive effects that eco-innovation and open innovation have on SMEs’ corporate performance. These results have important implications in the literature on dynamic capabilities that have not been previously tested. For companies and decision-makers, it shows why these practices in small and medium-sized companies should be encouraged. © 2020 by the authors.

Thus, the beliefs and norms that exist in the social capital of the Balinese Hindu concept can filter the information obtained from various information in business, which will ultimately be utilized by women entrepreneurs to create various innovations to meet the market demand. However, opportunities for women entrepreneurs are very limited to capital due to lack of guarantees to get capital, and a lack of entrepreneurship skills in the technological era, market access, bureaucracy, and legalization.

Rubera G., Chandrasekaran D., Ordanini A.;Open innovation, product portfolio innovativeness and firm performance: the dual role of new product development capabilities;2016;Despite a growing interest in the phenomenon of open innovation (OI), empirical evidence documenting the link between new product development capabilities, OI practices, and new product innovativeness is scarce. Eminent scholars have called for large-scale studies that systematically investigate the OI paradigm. Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm, new product development, and NPD capabilities literature streams, we conceptualize a framework in which OI practices are disentangled according to the stage of the new product development process in which they occur (development stage or commercialization stage). We identify two major types of OI practices: development-centric OI (which occurs in the development stage) and commercialization-centric OI (which occurs in the commercialization stage). Specific types of NPD capabilities—R&D, market information management, and launch—are expected to both influence the extent to which each OI practice is implemented and moderate the effect of each OI practice on product portfolio innovativeness and firm performance. The empirical analysis combines primary data from a survey of 239 firms with secondary data on innovation and financial outcomes. Our results support our hypotheses and indicate a need to differentiate among the different kinds of OI practices while elaborating on the complex role played by NPD capabilities in influencing OI practices. © 2015, Academy of Marketing Science.;Despite a growing interest in the phenomenon of Open Innovation, empirical evidence documenting the link between new product development capabilities, OI practices, and new product innovativeness is scarce.

Burcharth A.L.D.A., Knudsen M.P., Søndergaard H.A.;Neither invented nor shared here: The impact and management of attitudes for the adoption of open innovation practices;2014;Despite the massive interest in open innovation, limited attention has been expressed concerning the intra-organizational challenges in implementing it. An exemplary issue is the unwillingness of employees to undertake extra-organizational knowledge transactions in the form of negative attitudes against the sourcing of external knowledge (the not-invented-here (NIH) syndrome) and against the external exploitation of knowledge assets (the not-shared-here (NSH) syndrome). Using survey data collected from 331 firms, this article empirically assesses the theoretical assertion that the NIH and NSH syndromes have negative impacts on the adoption of inbound and outbound open innovation. Furthermore, it investigates how their effects can be reduced through competence-building programs based on the training of employees. By focusing on two attitudinal antecedents to openness, the findings offer an explanation for the problems that firms face in benefiting from inflows and outflows of knowledge and possible guidance as to how managers can disengage such attitudes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.;Despite the massive interest in Open Innovation, limited attention has been expressed concerning the intra-organizational challenges in implementing it. An exemplary issue is the unwillingness of employees to undertake extra-organizational knowledge transactions in the form of negative attitudes against the sourcing of external knowledge (the not-invented-here (NIH) syndrome) and against the external exploitation of knowledge assets (the not-shared-here (NSH) syndrome). Using survey data collected from 331 firms, this article empirically assesses the theoretical assertion that the NIH and NSH syndromes have negative impacts on the adoption of inbound and outbound Open Innovation. Furthermore, it investigates how their effects can be reduced through competence-building programs based on the training of employees.

In this study, we focus on open innovation processes among firms and radical circles and shed light on the related value capture mechanisms. We rely on a detailed qualitative case analysis of collaborations between firms and three radical circles (i.e., Slow Food, Memphis, and the Free Software Foundation). Our case studies highlight that the firms captured value from collaborating with these radical circles through developing internal assets (reputational, organizational, intellectual and human, and technological) and new business models. Starting from these insights, the study offers several contributions to open innovation research as well as interesting avenues for future inquiry into this topic. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.;Despite the wealth of research on Open Innovation, the mechanisms that enable capturing value through adopting an Open Innovation approach remain largely unexplored.

Nam K.W., Kim B.Y., Carnie B.W.;"Service open innovation; Design elements for the food and beverage service business";2018;Despite the well-recognised contribution of design to business, practitioners still find it challenging to manage design assets. Given that one cannot manage a business without measuring these assets, researchers and practitioners deem that the lack of a practical measuring tool for design is the cause of this unfavorable situation. Hence, establishing relevant criteria for measuring design effectiveness is essential for developing the tools. However, criteria must anticipate key business outcomes in order to demonstrate effectiveness, and to propose actionable items. Whether the outcome is sales figures or customer satisfaction survey results, the criteria should clearly link with business goals. Also, the technologies in the Fourth Industrial Revolution facilitate the quantification of customer behaviour related to business performance, such as lingering time on the website for shopping. In this context, statistical understanding of design elements is critical for determining appropriate strategies in the era of digitalised data. By utilising a Service Blueprint, this study also proposes a novel approach to tackle current challenges regarding the open innovation process. Since appropriately-developed design elements are the prerequisite of successful measurement, this study extracts the elements through in-depth interviews, and examines them quantitatively with existing business theory. As a result, design elements for the food and beverage service business are confirmed by using the Structural Equation Modeling. © 2018 by the authors.;Despite the well-recognised contribution of design to business, practitioners still find it challenging to manage design assets.

Freel M., Robson P.J.;Appropriation strategies and open innovation in SMEs;2017;Drawing upon data from the fifth UK Innovation Survey, this article sheds light on how management choices on the nature of appropriation relate to management choices on the degree of openness within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To this end, our findings indicate a threshold effect of both informal and formal appropriation mechanisms on the likelihood of engaging in both coupled and inbound open innovation. That is, an emphasis on appropriation appears to be important in shifting firms from a closed to an open strategy. There is, however, little evidence that either approach to appropriation increases the extent of open innovation. In this, only informal intellectual property (IP) protection mechanisms associate with an increasing extent of inbound open innovation. © 2016, © The Author(s) 2016.;Drawing upon data from the fifth UK Innovation Survey, this article sheds light on how management choices on the nature of appropriation relate to management choices on the degree of openness within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Yet, little is known about the impact of external knowledge sources on innovative activities in the renewable energy sector. Based on an analysis of original survey results involving R&D organisations, we examine the role of different knowledge sourcing strategies for innovation in two technology fields, namely solar and wind power. The link between external knowledge sourcing and innovation performance is found to depend on sourcing strategies and technology fields. Our results contribute to the evaluation of strategy design by showing that solar power innovation benefits from a broad search strategy drawing on a large number of external knowledge sources, while wind power innovation tends to thrive through intensive use of a more limited number of external sources.

Analyzing the Mediating Roles of Knowledge Sharing and Innovation Strategy;2020;Embracing outside-in open innovation (OI) can result in a plethora of organizational advantages, including improved innovation performance. Although some studies have found that outside-in OI improves innovation performance, others have shown that it has no effect or even a negative effect. This mixed empirical evidence leads to a need to unpack the relationship between outside-in OI and innovation performance, and to examine how certain key mediating variables related to the outside-in OI process can ensure that outside-in OI turns into improved innovation performance.

While it is evident that innovation is central to modernising and transforming governmental organisations, and that the co-creation of services by public authorities and community groups is an essential component of realising the benefits of investment in information and communication technology, there is little research focusing on the nature of innovation in transforming governmental organisations and services. Addressing this gap in the literature, this paper explores how open innovation strategies can transform public administration by examining how a network of municipalities in Sweden transforms value creation and service delivery by collaborating with each other and with external parties to accelerate the creation and exploitation of innovation. Using a case study with embedded units of analysis, four emerging typologies of governmental transformation based on open innovation are identified. The paper illustrates how these open innovation typologies (i) transform the organisation of the municipalities and (ii) help them deliver high quality co-created services to citizens. By examining the strategic and operational aspects that facilitate such activities, the analysis reveals the impact of open innovation on the business models of public authorities.

Nestle V., Täube F.A., Heidenreich S., Bogers M.;Establishing open innovation culture in cluster initiatives: The role of trust and information asymmetry;2019;Extant research has found superior performance of firms located in clusters. However, it is unclear whether this is based on mere proximity or other unobserved factors. We extend this literature by developing a framework to examine in what way institutions promote open innovation processes between clustered firms. Specifically, we develop a set of hypotheses to investigate to what extent structural and relational elements in a cluster organization affect the open innovation culture. Our model integrates effects of agglomeration, networks, information asymmetries and trust on open innovation culture. We focus on the underlying organizational norms established in clustered firms in relation to open innovation. Specifically, we measure open innovation culture in terms of not-invented- and not-sold-here syndromes, which is facilitated by the integration of trust and reduced by information asymmetry within the cluster region. We test this framework using novel and unique data from member and non-member firms of a cluster initiative in a German high-tech cluster. Our findings from moderation analysis show that a regulatory body in the cluster significantly influences the emergence of both inbound and outbound open innovation activities by member firms in the cluster initiative through increased effects of trust and information asymmetries. Thereby, our paper contributes to literatures of open innovation, including networks of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), and cluster policy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;Extant research has found superior performance of firms located in clusters.

We test this framework using novel and unique data from member and non-member firms of a cluster initiative in a German high-tech cluster. Our findings from moderation analysis show that a regulatory body in the cluster significantly influences the emergence of both inbound and outbound Open Innovation activities by member firms in the cluster initiative through increased effects of trust and information asymmetries. Thereby, our paper contributes to literatures of Open Innovation, including networks of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), and cluster policy. ;10.1016/j.techfore.2018.06.022;2-s2.0-85051568228;Germany;"Business, Management and Accounting; Psychology";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Ardito L., Messeni Petruzzelli A., Dezi L., Castellano S.;The influence of inbound open innovation on ambidexterity performance: Does it pay to source knowledge from supply chain stakeholders?;2020;Extant research has neglected an in-depth examination of the relationship between external knowledge sourcing and the ability of firms to balance radical and incremental innovation activities (i.e., innovation ambidexterity). Therefore, the present paper seeks to reveal the effects of knowledge sourcing activities directed toward three relevant supply chain stakeholders (i.e., suppliers, customers, and competitors) on innovation ambidexterity. Based on a sample of 5897 firms that participated in the Italian Innovation Survey (IIS) (2008–2010), we reveal that sourcing knowledge from suppliers, customers, and competitors has a positive influence on innovation ambidexterity, hence confirming our hypotheses. Specifically, suppliers represent the most relevant knowledge source, followed by customers and, then, competitors. These results expand the literature discussing the relationship between inbound open innovation and ambidexterity performance, which falls short of a clear understanding of whether and the extent to which sourcing knowledge from supply chain stakeholders facilitates achieving innovation ambidexterity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;Extant research has neglected an in-depth examination of the relationship between external knowledge sourcing and the ability of firms to balance radical and incremental innovation activities (i.e., innovation ambidexterity).

Keupp M.M., Gassmann O.;Determinants and archetype users of open innovation;2009;Extant research on open innovation (OI) offers no systematic insight of how and why firms differ regarding the extent to which they conduct OI activities. Whereas past theoretical contributions have focused on explaining the externalisation of R&D activities as a result of firm-external factors, we focus on explaining this externalisation as a result of firm-internal weaknesses, specifically, impediments to innovation. Using the exploration-exploitation dichotomy as our theoretical framework, we develop hypotheses on how impediments to innovation influence the breadth and depth of OI. We then test these hypotheses by using an exceptionally large and detailed data set to estimate population-averaged panel models. Our results provide support for most of the hypothesised relationships. Further, they allow to identify four 'archetypes' of firms that differ significantly regarding the breadth and depth of OI and the importance of impediments. Finally, we discuss the significance of these findings for both academics and managers. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Extant research on Open Innovation offers no systematic insight of how and why firms differ regarding the extent to which they conduct OI activities.

Spithoven A., Vanhaverbeke W., Roijakkers N.;Open innovation practices in SMEs and large enterprises;2013;Few studies on open innovation (OI) address OI practices in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and how their use of OI and the resulting benefits differ from those of large enterprises. The lack of resources in SMEs to engage in looking outward is said to be a barrier to OI, but at the same time this shortage is cited as a motive for looking beyond organisational boundaries for technological knowledge. We investigate how OI dimensions impact the innovative performance of SMEs in comparison to large companies. The key finding is that the effects of OI practices in SMEs often differ from those in large firms. SMEs are more effective in using different OI practices simultaneously when they introduce new products on the market, whereas this is less the case for large firms. Turnover from new products in SMEs is driven by intellectual property protection mechanisms, while large firms in this case benefit more from their search strategies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.;Few studies on Open Innovation address OI practices in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and how their use of OI and the resulting benefits differ from those of large enterprises.

Macchi M., Rizzo U., Ramaciotti L.;From services dealers to innovation brokers: How open innovation paradigm affects incubator activities. Evidence from Italy;2014;Findings – The analysis allows us to propose a theoretical framework and to highlight how different structural capital shape heterogeneous processes by which incubatees build their RC. The authors find that important differences in RC formation are present both at an exchange of knowledge level within the incubator, and across incubator boundaries.Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the strategies business incubators (BI) adopt in respect to the creation of incubatee intellectual capital, and it focuses in particular on links between BI structural capital and the creation of incubatee relational capital (RC). By crossing IC literature with the open innovation paradigm the authors consider the incubator as an innovation intermediary and the authors investigate how different incubator strategies of knowledge exchange take place within and across incubator boundaries. The main issues the authors seek to explore regard the mechanisms by which incubators shape the exchange of knowledge within and across their boundaries and the rationale underlying such an approach.Design/methodology/approach – The analysis is based on a multiple case study research involving five Italian incubators. Primary and secondary data were gathered through interviews with each incubator managing director and with relevant actors.Research limitations/implications – The main limitations of this study regard the generalizability of results. This is mostly an exploratory work and further research based on quantitative rather than qualitative analysis, would provide stronger evidence in order to validate the results with respect to the population of incubators and consequently lead to more precise policy implications.Originality/value – The analysis points to the importance of recognizing different BI approaches regarding the mechanisms by which incubatees develop their RC, and allows us to gain a knowledge-based conceptualization of incubators. This definition moves beyond the more diffuse classification based on public vs private and sectoral specificities, and introduces some new insights for further research. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Findings – The analysis allows us to propose a theoretical framework and to highlight how different structural capital shape heterogeneous processes by which incubatees build their RC.

Corral de Zubielqui G., Fryges H., Jones J.;Social media, open innovation & HRM: Implications for performance;2019;"Firms are increasingly leveraging social media tools to access knowledge from external actors, particularly customers and other users, to facilitate the innovation process and firm performance. Yet empirical research investigating the impact of external knowledge sourced via social media tools is scant; empirical studies that do exist are mixed, leading to calls for research into the conditions under which knowledge flows via social media from external actors contribute to innovation and firm performance. Using a large-scale survey of firms in Tasmania, Australia, this study examines how external knowledge flows from market-based actors sourced by social media influence innovation and business performance, and the extent to which modern human resource management (HRM)practices moderate this relationship. We find that while knowledge flows from market-based actors are positively related to innovativeness, the relationship between external knowledge flows via social media and innovativeness depends on the importance a firm places on modern HRM practices: a significant positive relationship exists between knowledge sourced via social media and innovativeness when firms attach high importance to modern HRM practices. In contrast, there is no significant relationship in firms in which modern HRM practices are of low importance. The study also shows that social media serves as a mediator for the effect of external knowledge flows on firm innovativeness when firms attach high importance to modern HRM practices. Furthermore, while the results demonstrate that innovativeness and firm performance are positively related, innovativeness does not translate into improved firm performance in firms that attach low importance to modern HRM practices. Taken together, the findings underscore the importance of modern HRM practices to enable knowledge inflows via social media to influence innovativeness, and innovativeness to translate into productivity benefits. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.";"Firms are increasingly leveraging social media tools to access knowledge from external actors, particularly customers and other users, to facilitate the innovation process and firm performance.

All of this additional input helps firms compete profitably in an increasingly difficult environment. New trends include open innovation, crowdsourcing, user toolkits, mass customization and lead-user analysis. While there is emerging academic research on all of these topics, their usefulness in fashion marketing and merchandising remains relatively unexplored. This is potentially a great research opportunity, as fashion designers can obtain key ideas that boost competitiveness by working more closely with customers, suppliers, retailers and other parties.

Xie X., Wang H.;How can open innovation ecosystem modes push product innovation forward? An fsQCA analysis;2020;"Firms in open innovation ecosystems expand organizational resources and allow for collaborations across organizations, which can promote the flow, aggregation, and integration of resources within business network ecosystems. Yet, particular gaps in the literature limit our understanding of how open innovation ecosystems contribute to firm product innovation. Therefore, this study explores the causal recipes of how open innovation ecosystem modes promote product innovation by using both grounded theory and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). First, by taking four innovative firms as case studies and applying grounded theory, we identify six specific open innovation ecosystem modes: “firm-university-institute cooperation,” “interfirm cooperation,” “firm-intermediary cooperation,” “firm-user cooperation,” “asset divestiture,” and “technology transfer.” Then, based on the data of 226 innovative firms, we employ fsQCA to explore the causal configurations of the open innovation ecosystem modes that consistently improve product innovation. The findings reveal that three particular combinations can explain the high level of product innovation: (1) interfirm cooperation, firm-intermediary cooperation, and technology transfer combined with asset divestiture; (2) interfirm cooperation, firm-intermediary cooperation, and technology transfer combined with firm-university-institute cooperation; and (3) interfirm cooperation, firm-intermediary cooperation, and firm-university-institute cooperation combined with firm-user cooperation.

Bianchi M., Croce A., Dell'Era C., Di Benedetto C.A., Frattini F.;Organizing for Inbound Open Innovation: How External Consultants and a Dedicated R&D Unit Influence Product Innovation Performance;2016;Firms increasingly acquire technological knowledge from external sources to improve their innovation performance. This strategic approach is known as inbound open innovation. The existing empirical evidence regarding the impact of inbound open innovation on performance, however, is ambiguous. The equivocal results are due to moderating factors that influence a firm's ability to acquire technological knowledge from external sources and to transform it into innovation outputs. This paper focuses on a relevant yet overlooked category of moderating factors: organization of research and development (R&D). It explores two organizational mechanisms: one informal and external-oriented (involvement of external consultants in R&D activities) and one formalized and internal-oriented (existence of a dedicated R&D unit), in the acquisition of technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing, a particular contractual form for inbound open innovation. Drawing on a capabilities perspective and using a longitudinal dataset of 841 Spanish manufacturing firms observed over the period 1999-2007, this paper provides a fine-grained analysis of the moderating effects of the two organizational mechanisms. The involvement of external consultants in R&D activities strengthens the impact of inbound open innovation on innovation performance by increasing marginal benefits of acquiring external technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing. Moreover, it reduces the level of inbound open innovation to which the highest innovation performance corresponds. Instead, the existence of a dedicated R&D unit makes the firm less sensitive to changes in the level of inbound open innovation, by reducing marginal benefits of acquiring external technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing, and increases the level of inbound open innovation to which the highest innovation performance corresponds. The results regarding the role of informal and formalized R&D organizational mechanisms contribute to research on open innovation and absorptive capacity, and also inform managers as to what organizational mechanism is recommended to acquire external technological knowledge, depending on the objectives that the firm pursues. © 2015 Product Development & Management Association.;Firms increasingly acquire technological knowledge from external sources to improve their innovation performance.

Faems D., De Visser M., Andries P., Van Looy B.;Technology alliance portfolios and financial performance: Value-enhancing and cost-increasing effects of open innovation;2010;Firms increasingly adopt an open innovation model in which they rely on technology alliances to complement and supplement their internal innovation efforts. Although previous studies provide in-depth insight into the impact of technology alliances on the innovation performance, they remain relatively silent on how technology alliances eventually influence the financial performance of the firm. The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a conceptual framework that disentangles both the value-enhancing and cost-increasing effects of technology alliances on financial performance. The model was tested with a sample of 305 Belgian manufacturing firms. Combining data from the Belgian Community Information Survey (CIS IV) database and the BELFIRST database, structural equation analyses were conducted on the connection among technology alliance portfolio diversity, product innovation performance, and financial performance. This study's data provide empirical confirmation for the 0061ssumption of existing research that technology alliance portfolio diversity has an indirect positive impact on financial performance via increased product innovation performance. However, a direct cost-increasing effect of technology alliance portfolio diversity on financial performance is observed. Moreover, the structural equation analyses suggest that, in the short-term, the direct cost-increasing effect of technology alliance portfolio diversity exceeds the indirect value-generating effect of technology alliances. These findings contribute to the current research on open innovation in two important ways. First, these results support the open innovation model by illuminating the interconnectedness between internal and external innovation strategies. In particular, technology alliance portfolio diversity has a positive impact on internal innovation efforts, which increases product innovation performance. Second, the findings complement the focus of existing open innovation research on the value-generating properties of technology alliances, directing attention to the cost-increasing effects of such collaborative strategies. On a managerial level, these findings suggest that, when making technology alliance decisions, managers not only should consider the potential benefits of such collaborative strategies but also should take into account the additional costs of intensifying the technology alliance portfolio. © 2010 Product Development & Management Association.;Firms increasingly adopt an Open Innovation model in which they rely on technology alliances to complement and supplement their internal innovation efforts.

Lichtenthaler U.;Outbound open innovation and its effect on firm performance: Examining environmental influences;2009;Firms may open up their innovation processes on two dimensions. While inbound open innovation refers to the acquisition of external technology in open exploration processes, outbound open innovation describes the outward transfer of technology in open exploitation processes. Prior open innovation research has focused on the inbound dimension, whereas the outbound dimension has been relatively neglected. Therefore, this article addresses the relationship between outbound open R&D strategies and firm performance. We use data from 136 industrial firms to test four hypotheses on the moderating effects of environmental factors in the relationship between open innovation strategies and firm performance. The results show that the degree of technological turbulence, the transaction rate in technology markets, and the competitive intensity in technology markets strengthen the positive effects of outbound open innovation on firm performance. By contrast, the degree of patent protection does not facilitate successful open innovation. The results are crucially important to managers because they show under what environmental conditions open innovation strategies enhance performance. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Firms may open up their innovation processes on two dimensions.

Frankort, HTW;OPEN INNOVATION NORMS AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER IN INTERFIRM TECHNOLOGY ALLIANCES: EVIDENCE FROM INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, 1980-1999;2013;Firms tend to transfer more knowledge in technology joint ventures compared to contractual technology agreements. Using insights from new institutional economics, this chapter explores to what extent the alliance governance association with interfirm knowledge transfer is sensitive to an evolving industry norm of collaboration connected to the logic of open innovation. The chapter examines 1,888 dyad-year observations on firms engaged in technology alliances in the U.S. information technology industry during 1980-1999. Using fixed effects linear models, it analyzes longitudinal changes in the alliance governance association with interfirm knowledge transfer, and how such changes vary in magnitude across bilateral versus multipartner alliances, and across computers, telecommunications equipment, software, and microelectronics subsectors. Increases in industry-level alliance activity during 1980-1999 improved the knowledge transfer performance of contractual technology agreements relative to more hierarchical equity joint ventures. This effect was concentrated in bilateral rather than multipartner alliances, and in the software and microelectronics rather than computers and telecommunications equipment subsectors. Therefore, an evolving industry norm of collaboration may sometimes make more arms-length governance of a technology alliance a credible substitute for equity ownership, which can reduce the costs of interfirm R&D. Overall, the chapter shows that the performance of material practices that constitute innovation ecosystems, such as interfirm technology alliances, may differ over time subject to prevailing institutional norms of open innovation.

Implications for Open Innovation in the distant search contexts are discussed. ;10.1016/j.techfore.2017.02.009;2-s2.0-85017161965;France;"Business, Management and Accounting; Psychology";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Cheng C.C.J., Shiu E.C.;Establishing a typology of open innovation strategies and their differential impacts on innovation success in an Asia-Pacific developed economy;2021;Firms use open innovation strategy to explore external knowledge or exploit internal knowledge to benefit their product/service innovations, and thus enhance their innovation performance. However, a lack of relational mechanisms makes it more difficult for collaborative partners to share their knowledge assets. Existing literature lacks a clear explanation of how knowledge and relational mechanisms simultaneously function for innovation success. In response, this study attempts to answer: (1) Can archetypes of open innovation strategies be identified by knowledge and relational mechanisms simultaneously? And, (2) Do they differ in their ability to predict innovation success under the condition of innovation process characteristics? An exploratory study of 78 open innovation firms reflects four archetypes of open innovation strategies. A subsequent cross-industry survey of 248 open innovation firms in Taiwan reveals that the four archetypes of open innovation strategies result in varying degrees of innovation success, and innovation process characteristics positively moderate such associations. © 2019, The Author(s).;Firms use Open Innovation strategy to explore external knowledge or exploit internal knowledge to benefit their product/service innovations, and thus enhance their innovation performance.

Battistella C., Nonino F.;Open innovation web-based platforms: The impact of different forms of motivation on collaboration;2012;Given that open innovation web-based platforms (OIPs) allow for the collaboration of individuals and companies, this paper focuses on exploring the motivations for participating and collaborating in OIPs. Extant studies are conflicting, especially with respect to the importance of the monetary reward as a motivation. Moreover, literature supports our premise from the individuals' motivations analysis viewpoint, but not from the companies' perspective. Finally, literature does not consider the differences related to different members and to different phases of the innovation process. First, we base the literature on open innovation on the Internet (crowdsourcing, peer production and open source) to identify the potential motivations. We then deeply analyse 116 OIPs to determine if the motivations can be a function of the phase of innovation and the dependency on members. We show that the design of the motivational system should take into consideration the different stages of the innovation process and that the OIPs should consider moving from 'work place' logic to 'social place' logic. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.;Given that Open Innovation web-based platforms (OIPs) allow for the collaboration of individuals and companies, this paper focuses on exploring the motivations for participating and collaborating in OIPs.

Tsinopoulos C., Sousa C.M.P., Yan J.;Process Innovation: Open Innovation and the Moderating Role of the Motivation to Achieve Legitimacy;2018;Global competition has increased the pressure for firms to develop new and efficient processes in ways that are perceived to be legitimate. At the same time, there has been a realization that engaging with open innovation can improve competitiveness. Our study aims to address two research questions: (a) How does engaging with open innovation support an organization's process innovation? and (b) How does the motivation to achieve legitimacy affect the relationship between engaging with open innovation and process innovation? We use arguments from the resource-based view to explain how open innovation influences an organization's likelihood of introducing new processes. We then use arguments from institutional theory to explain how the motivation to achieve legitimacy moderates this relationship. We test our conceptual model using data from the European Community Innovation Survey administered by the U.K. government. Our findings and theoretical development support the notion that engagement with open innovation will increase the likelihood of introducing new processes and that the motivation to achieve legitimacy will affect this relationship. However, this moderating effect will be different depending on how engagement takes place. It will be positive on co-operation with external parties, and negative on the use of information. Therefore, when organizations co-operate with external parties and are motivated to achieve legitimacy, the likelihood of introducing a new process will increase. However, the effect is opposite in the case of use of external information. These findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between open and process innovation. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association;Global competition has increased the pressure for firms to develop new and efficient processes in ways that are perceived to be legitimate.

Kim B., Kim E., Foss N.J.;Balancing absorptive capacity and inbound open innovation for sustained innovative performance: An attention-based view;2016;How can a firm develop new ideas and turn them into profitable innovations on a sustained basis? We address this fundamental issue in a novel way by developing an integrative framework of absorptive capacity (AC) and inbound open innovation that is rooted in the attention-based view of the firm. We specifically address why a balance between open and closed innovation is important from the perspective of absorptive capacity, and show how it may be brought about. Pursuing either open or closed inbound innovation alone may result in an imbalance between potential AC and realized AC as well as inward-looking AC and outward-looking AC, which will hinder innovative performance. We argue that practicing open and closed inbound innovation repeatedly and alternately by switching organizational attentions, and thus developing the associated AC, can facilitate balancing absorptive capacity and lead to innovative performance. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.;How can a firm develop new ideas and turn them into profitable innovations on a sustained basis?

Park J.H., Kim C.Y.;Social enterprises, job creation, and social open innovation;2020;How can social problems be solved? The complicated and rapidly changing problems of modern society require all the actors of the economy to create social values to solve problems. Social enterprises create social value in the field of business and solve many social problems through employment. The increasing number of diverse social problems has stimulated interest in social enterprises. This study identifies employment in social enterprises in terms of its quantity and quality. The human resources required for social enterprises must be unique and valuable, but many social enterprises fail to utilize human resources by maintaining contractual and short-term employment relationships even though long-term and continuing employment relationships are valuable. Therefore, this study identifies the economic value created by social enterprises as a basis for the creation of high-quality jobs and confirms the role that government grants and return on assets play in that relationship. As a result of panel analysis of social enterprises, the direct effect of net income on the quantity of employment and its indirect effect on the quality of employment were confirmed. Additionally, in companies receiving significant government grants, the relationship between net income and the quantity of employment is found to be strong, and the return on assets found to strengthen the indirect effects of net income on the quality of employment. This study has academic and practical implications for social enterprises through its review of theory and empirical analysis. © 2020 by the authors.

Drawing upon Project Management and Open Innovation capability-building frameworks, we studied the crusade of an industrial company to create an open innovation capability. In that sense, we applied an Event Structure Analysis (ESA) to evaluate the event network, which evidenced a four-stage process: closed mode, open driver, vanguard project, project-to-organization. Results demonstrate, from causal connections, that the referred capability can be leveraged from the execution of key projects, especially from a vanguard project. Our study contributes to Project Management theory by reveling that previous experiences in both project and organizational levels offer a fertile ground for the emergence of a vanguard project.

Kodama F., Shibata T.;Beyond fusion towards IoT by way of open innovation: An investigation based on the Japanese machine tool industry 1975-2015;2017;"In a last few decades, innovation research scholars proposed several new concepts, one after another, but independently, and in a chronological sequence: technology fusion; digital convergence; disruptive technology; open innovation; and IoT (Internet of Things). Each concept has its own explaining power for a certain innovation at a certain time period, but has obvious limitations. A basic question is, therefore, whether each of those proposed concepts is independent among them or inter-related dynamically, i.e. in what sequences? In order to answer this question, a specific industrial product, i.e. machine tools, is selected for our study. Although the machine tool is described as the mother machine, i.e. the machine of all the machinery, this industry experienced a drastic technological shift toward NC (numerically controlled) revolution around 1975. However, up until now, this industry continues to be a pivotal industry in modern and high-tech industrial era. By reviewing the technological history of the Japanese machine tool industry from 1975 to 2015, we observed several technological shifts even after the NC revolution, each of which can be explained with one of those concepts proposed in the last decades. We find a dynamic interrelationship among those concepts in the following sequence with the publication dates in parenthesis: disruptive technology (1997), technology fusion (1992), open innovation (2003), digital convergence (1996).

A basic question is, therefore, whether each of those proposed concepts is independent among them or inter-related dynamically, i.e. in what sequences? In order to answer this question, a specific industrial product, i.e. machine tools, is selected for our study. Although the machine tool is described as the mother machine, i.e. the machine of all the machinery, this industry experienced a drastic technological shift toward NC (numerically controlled) revolution around 1975. However, up until now, this industry continues to be a pivotal industry in modern and high-tech industrial era. By reviewing the technological history of the Japanese machine tool industry from 1975 to 2015, we observed several technological shifts even after the NC revolution, each of which can be explained with one of those concepts proposed in the last decades. We find a dynamic interrelationship among those concepts in the following sequence with the publication dates in parenthesis: disruptive technology (1997), technology fusion (1992), Open Innovation (2003), digital convergence (1996). We describe characteristics and analytical framework for IoT innovation that has gone beyond the traditional Schumpeterian formulation of innovation.

Stead, SM;Using systems thinking and open innovation to strengthen aquaculture policy for the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals;2019;"In a world of 9 billion people and a widening income gap between the rich and poor, it is time to rethink how aquaculture can strengthen its contribution to the second UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger in our generation. The disparity in the level of sustainable aquaculture development at present, between and within countries, especially regarding human access to farmed aquatic food remains highly variable across the globe. This paper offers a fresh look at the opportunities from using systems thinking and new open innovation measuring tools to grow sustainable aquaculture. Political will in many nations is the main constraint to aquaculture in realising its potential as an: accessible source of micronutrients and nutritious protein; aid to meeting conservation goals; economic prosperity generator where benefits extend to locals and provider of indirect social benefits such as access to education and well-being, among others. Resources to enable strong partnerships (SDG 17) between academia, civic society, government and industry should be prioritised by governments to build a sustainable aquatic food system, accessible to all, forever.";"In a world of 9 billion people and a widening income gap between the rich and poor, it is time to rethink how aquaculture can strengthen its contribution to the second UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of zero hunger in our generation.

Lichtenthaler U.;Open innovation in practice: An analysis of strategic approaches to technology transactions;2008;In addition to acquiring external technology, firms have started to actively commercialize technological knowledge, which represents the opposite type of technology transactions. The strong interactions with a firm's environment contrast the traditional closed approaches to innovation. Therefore, this new paradigm has been termed open innovation. Prior research into this field has mostly been limited to theoretical considerations and case studies. More general work has usually focused either on external technology acquisition or on external technology exploitation. Accordingly, I take an integrated perspective and regard the two types of technology transactions as the main dimensions of a firm's strategic approach to open innovation. Drawing on these dimensions, I use data from a questionnaire-based study of 154 middle and large companies to identify groups of firms that pursue homogeneous strategies regarding open innovation. Accordingly, this analysis is the first large-scale study that describes the current state of open innovation in practice. Moreover, it is the first work that identifies strategic approaches of firms to technology transactions along the innovation process. © 2008 IEEE.;In addition to acquiring external technology, firms have started to actively commercialize technological knowledge, which represents the opposite type of technology transactions.

Menaouer B., Nada M.;The relationship between knowledge mapping and the open innovation process: The case of education system;2020;In an increasingly competitive economic environment, innovation has become an invaluable asset to the organization and for effective knowledge management (KM). Nowadays, organizations are knowledge based and their success and survival depend on creativity, diversity, and innovation. A knowledge map is a vital tool for better KM and innovation. To this effect, the innovation processes on KMin education system through knowledge transfer activities will facilitate the shift from teaching as knowledge transmission to teaching as learning facilitation. In this context, we present a new approach based on, the one hand, the critical knowledge mapping being based on an extraction work of the expert knowledge and on the other hand, the description of the conceptual framework design which allows one to exploit and integrate knowledge capitalized and external knowledge by the open innovation process. In addition, this practice makes it possible to examine how KM, in particular, the knowledge mapping, can be used to establish the flow of the internal and external information in order to increase the efficiency of creativity and invention. © Cambridge University Press 2019.;In an increasingly competitive economic environment, innovation has become an invaluable asset to the organization and for effective knowledge management (KM).

Terwiesch C., Xu Y.;Innovation contests, open innovation, and multiagent problem solving;2008;In an innovation contest, a firm (the seeker) facing an innovation-related problem (e.g., a technical R&D problem) posts this problem to a population of independent agents (the solvers) and then provides an award to the agent that generated the best solution. In this paper, we analyze the interaction between a seeker and a set of solvers. Prior research in economics suggests that having many solvers work on an innovation problem will lead to a lower equilibrium effort for each solver, which is undesirable from the perspective of the seeker. In contrast, we establish that the seeker can benefit from a larger solver population because he obtains a more diverse set of solutions, which mitigates and sometimes outweighs the effect of the solvers' underinvestment in effort. We demonstrate that the inefficiency of the innovation contest resulting from the solvers' underinvestment can further be reduced by changing the award structure from a fixed-price award to a performance-contingent award. Finally, we compare the quality of the solutions and seeker profits with the case of an internal innovation process. This allows us to predict which types of products and which cost structures will be the most likely to benefit from the contest approach to innovation. © 2008 INFORMS.;In an innovation contest, a firm (the seeker) facing an innovation-related problem (e.g., a technical R&D problem) posts this problem to a population of independent agents (the solvers) and then provides an award to the agent that generated the best solution.

Gambardella A., Panico C.;On the management of open innovation;2014;In an open innovation relationship, the party that owns a key asset enjoys bargaining power that discourages the investments of the other party in the collaboration. We show that these incentives can be restored by conferring on the weak party the power to take decisions during the research process - e.g., a pharmaceutical firm with manufacturing and commercialization assets offers the direction of a joint research project to a biotech partner. However, on many occasions, the strong party still captures more value from the collaboration by retaining the power to take decisions during research even if it produces less innovation value and fewer aggregate profits. We conclude that the potential of open innovation is underexploited.

Liu Q., Du Q., Hong Y., Fan W., Wu S.;User idea implementation in open innovation communities: Evidence from a new product development crowdsourcing community;2020;In collaborative crowdsourcing communities for open innovation, users generate and submit ideas as idea co-creators. Firms then select and implement valuable ideas for new product development. Despite the popularity and success of these open innovation communities, relatively little is known about the factors that determine the implementation of the user-generated ideas. Based on research on individual creativity, we propose a conceptual model integrating users' previous experience, idea presentation characteristics and feedback valence to explain the likelihood of idea implementation. We validate our research model with a panel data analysis of 43 550 ideas submitted by 16 360 users in the MIUI new product development community hosted by Xiaomi, a large electronics manufacturing company in China. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between users' past successful experience and idea implementation. Furthermore, the length of ideas is positively associated with the likelihood of idea implementation. There is also an inverted U-shaped relationship between supporting evidence and idea implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the negative effect of positive feedback and the positive effect of negative feedback on idea implementation. These findings offer rich insights to understand the phenomenon of open innovation better.

Shin K.-O., Yeom N.-G., Park H.-S.;Customer happiness and open innovation in the esthetics education for the elderly generation;2019;In Korean society, where aging is rapidly progressing, the happiness of the elderly is no longer an economic issue. An esthetics program has the effect of improving depression or low self-esteem to increase psychological and physical satisfaction, which is a good way to raise the happiness index of the elderly. However, there is a lack of esthetics education or esthetics programs in Korea to train estheticians to serve elderly people. This study confirmed the possibility of open innovation through esthetics education to increase the happiness index of the elderly. As a research method, a self-administered questionnaire was used to survey 572 estheticians and analyzed statistically. In this study, Korean estheticians were very positive about the need for the development of professional care programs for the elderly, and it was found that they are willing to care for the elderly. Developing a variety of esthetic programs through the training of professional manpower for the elderly in the future will contribute to enhancing the happiness index of elderly Korean people. © 2019 by the authors.;In Korean society, where aging is rapidly progressing, the happiness of the elderly is no longer an economic issue.

Dong J.Q., Netten J.;Information technology and external search in the open innovation age: New findings from Germany;2017;In light of the fact that firms increasingly use information technology (IT) for open innovation initiatives, this paper explores how IT investment influences their external search from multiple perspectives: breadth, and depth along vertical, horizontal and societal dimensions. The basic premise is that IT investment has inverted U-shaped relationships with external search breadth and depth. On the one hand, IT investment enhances firms' ability to acquire more information from external knowledge sources. On the other hand, however, IT investment can bring abundant information from external knowledge sources to firms, making it increasingly difficult to widely and deeply use the information from available sources. Beyond a certain threshold, excessive IT investment is likely to cause information overload, forcing firms with limited attention to narrow down and go less deeply into their external knowledge sources. By using a large-scale panel data set from German firms, we find empirical evidence corroborating our theory. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;In light of the fact that firms increasingly use information technology (IT) for Open Innovation initiatives, this paper explores how IT investment influences their external search from multiple perspectives: breadth, and depth along vertical, horizontal and societal dimensions.

Lichtenthaler U.;Technology exploitation in the context of open innovation: Finding the right 'job' for your technology;2010;In light of the recent economic crisis, many industrial firms attempt to capture additional value from their technologies by means of open innovation strategies. Besides acquiring external technology, many firms therefore increasingly try to license their own technology to other firms either exclusively or in addition to its application in their own products. This article shows that technology licensing offers important strategic benefits beyond generating licensing revenues, which underscore the need for an integrated management of technology licensing activities. Therefore, this article extends the concept of job-related markets that was recently developed in the managerial literature. A 'job' is the fundamental problem that a customer needs to resolve in a particular situation. Managers may transfer this job-related understanding to technology licensing activities because the right 'job' for a technology may be outside a firm's boundaries, and it may help firms to identify additional licensing opportunities. On this basis, the article presents the concept of an integrated technology exploitation roadmap, which allows firms to use the job-related markets to integrate technology licensing in their strategic planning processes. An example of a machinery firm shows how this roadmap may contribute to strengthening a firm's licensing business. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Hofstetter R., Aryobsei S., Herrmann A.;Should You Really Produce What Consumers Like Online? Empirical Evidence for Reciprocal Voting in Open Innovation Contests;2018;In open innovation, firms increasingly rely on online consumer votes to evaluate ideas for new products and services. Votes can represent cost-effective external information about idea quality that can inform and facilitate a firm's task of evaluating and screening of ideas at the early stages of the innovation process. Challenging this perception, we proposed that consumer votes provided in open innovation contests can be socially biased by reciprocal voting. On the basis of theories related to cooperation and social influence, we argued that both gregarious consumers (those who solicit social ties) and consumers who initiate direct reciprocity (those who vote for others) signal a willingness to cooperate that stimulates reciprocal voting from peers. We empirically investigated consumer voting behavior using a unique dataset with information obtained from actual open innovation contests in which consumers could submit their own ideas and see and vote for the ideas of others. We found that both gregariousness and the initiation of direct reciprocity positively influence votes received. Such cooperation pays off for consumers because firms indeed use votes to inform internal idea evaluations. We also found, however, that the votes an idea receives during an innovation contest cannot significantly explain its later revealed quality. Reciprocity may be an effective form of cooperation among consumers, but it has potentially negative implications for firms' evaluations. Our results also indicated that beyond reciprocity, consumers and firms value different types of ideas, which further differentiates their evaluations. Thus, firms should not only be aware of social biases in votes but also account for the diverging idea preferences of customers. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association;In Open Innovation, firms increasingly rely on online consumer votes to evaluate ideas for new products and services.

Recent studies, however, indicate that firms differ considerably in their ability to reap the benefits from crowdsourcing. Drawing upon recent work on the microfoundations of capabilities, we hypothesize how three types of lower level organizational elements may affect gains from crowdsourcing: informal organizational roles, formal organizational roles, and knowledge processes. Following a mixed-method research design and drawing on rich quantitative and qualitative data, we find that informal and formal organizational roles work through processes of knowledge articulation and codification in developing a firm’s crowdsourcing capability. By going beyond the direct effects of the three antecedents, our research sheds light on the process of capability development for open innovation. © 2019 Product Development & Management Association;In recent years, crowdsourcing has emerged as a promising Open Innovation strategy for firms searching for solutions to technical problems.

Popa S., Soto-Acosta P., Martinez-Conesa I.;Antecedents, moderators, and outcomes of innovation climate and open innovation: An empirical study in SMEs;2017;In recent years, open innovation (OI) has attracted much attention in innovation management research. Although showing signs of advance, most of the existing literature still relies, to a great extent, on case studies and conceptual frameworks, with little empirical research in the specific context of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper adds to the literature by empirically assessing the effects of organizational antecedents and innovation climate on OI as well as its consequences on firm performance in SMEs. In addition, the moderating roles of environmental dynamisms and competitiveness in the relationships between innovation climate and inbound and outbound OI are analyzed. To achieve these goals, this paper develops an integrative research model, which analyses the network relations using covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) on a data set of 429 Spanish SMEs. Results revealed that organizational factors such as commitment-based human resources practices have a positive influence on innovation climate and that innovation climate contributes to both inbound and outbound OI. Another important finding is that contingent factors such as environmental dynamism strengthen the positive effect of innovation climate on outbound OI. The main conclusions of this research can be valuable to SMEs that implement or intend to implement OI. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;In recent years, Open Innovation has attracted much attention in innovation management research.

Dragsdahl Lauritzen G., Karafyllia M.;Perspective: Leveraging Open Innovation through Paradox;2019;In search of fresh ideas, firms increasingly engage with external contributors in open innovation collaborations. However, research has found that such collaborations frequently fail, and has pointed to conflicting demands of control and openness. On the one hand, firms want controlled and selective participation, clarity of purpose, and a choice of ideas based on their own current capacity and value appropriation strategies. On the other, their external contributors tend to want open and unfettered participation, the creative potential of the idea per se, and unrestricted knowledge sharing. This article proposes to shift the conceptual frame from looking at the tensions between control and openness as problems to looking at them as synergies. Drawing on the literature of open innovation and organizational paradox, this article contributes a novel perspective on open innovation that suggests how firms can leverage open innovation collaborations through paradox by combining practices based on differentiation and integration. © 2018 Product Development & Management Association;In search of fresh ideas, firms increasingly engage with external contributors in Open Innovation collaborations.

Ahn J.M., Minshall T., Mortara L.;Understanding the human side of openness: the fit between open innovation modes and CEO characteristics;2017;In small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), where typically the decision-making process is highly centralised, important decisions, such as open innovation (OI) adoption, will be strongly influenced by the characteristics of their Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). Pointing the attention to the strategic leadership and human elements, this paper sheds light on the micro-foundation of OI by emphasising the role that the personal traits of key individuals in innovation. OI adoption could result in the enactment of several OI modes – each representing an opportunity of potential change (of market, of technology or/and of the organisation) – and this paper attempts to examine the relationships between the CEO characteristics and each of the OI modes. Our analysis, using Korean SME data, shows that CEOs’ positive attitude, entrepreneurial orientation (EO), patience and education can play important roles in facilitating OI in SMEs. However, this paper also observed that the effects of CEO characteristics on OI adoption were differently configured according to the nature of each OI mode, for example, CEOs’ patience and EO had different impacts depending on the degree of uncertainty in the OI mode. This suggest that OI must be understood as a wide innovation spectrum, and, to increase opportunities for successful OI adoption, CEOs have to attempt to compensate for characteristics they may lack by recruiting appropriate complementary top managements. The research has practical implications for CEOs and policy makers who are interested in enhancing competitiveness of SMEs. © 2017 The Authors.

Firms in the financial sector must be innovative in terms of service quality and operational performance to obtain customer loyalty and gain financial stability. A dearth of studies on customer loyalty and financial performance of Islamic Banks motivated the authors to examine the relationship between customer loyalty and financial performance. The study also explores whether the service qualities have any impact on customer loyalty. The study uses both primary and secondary data to conclude the research objectives. A survey of 356 questionnaires was carried out among the customers of the selected Islamic banks of Bangladesh to gather information regarding customer service quality and customer loyalty, while financial performance data were attained from the annual reports. Moreover, the study follows the SERVQUAL model’s five dimensions (tangibles, empathy, assurance, reliability, and responsiveness) to determine the service quality of Bangladeshi Islamic Banks. Rigorous statistical techniques, including exploratory factor analysis, reliability testing, and regression analysis were used to investigate the hypothesis. The study empirically documents a positively significant impact of service quality (tangibles, empathy, reliability, and responsiveness) on customer loyalty, while assurance shows an insignificant relationship. Furthermore, the study does not find any significant relationship between customer loyalty and the financial performance of Bangladeshi Islamic Banks. The findings of the study profoundly denote that the financial performance of Bangladeshi Islamic Banks mostly depends on many other financial and non-financial factors, rather than customer loyalty. © 2020 by the authors.

Xie X., Wang H.;How to bridge the gap between innovation niches and exploratory and exploitative innovations in open innovation ecosystems;2021;In the context of open innovation business environments, more and more firms are joining together and creating innovation ecosystems to improve their innovation capabilities by interacting with heterogeneous actors. Yet, there has been little research that has examined the mechanisms regarding how and when firms within such open innovation ecosystems could enhance their innovation capabilities. To address this gap, we propose and empirically test a conceptual framework for understanding the internal mechanisms and contextual conditions in the relationship between a firm's innovation niche and its exploratory and exploitative innovations. Using a sample of 327 Chinese manufacturing firms in strategic emerging industries, we find that a firm's innovation niche within an open innovation ecosystem has a positive impact on its exploratory and exploitative innovations, and we demonstrate that these relationships are mediated by the innovation ecological network. Additionally, we find that the innovation ecological environment moderates the relationship between a firm's innovation niche and the innovation ecological network. Furthermore, we show that the innovation ecological environment moderates the indirect effects of a firm's innovation niche on its exploratory and exploitative innovations via the innovation ecological network. These results not only enrich the research on open innovation ecosystems but also provide important managerial implications for implementing innovation niche initiatives to foster firms’ exploratory and exploitative innovations. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.;In the context of Open Innovation business environments, more and more firms are joining together and creating innovation ecosystems to improve their innovation capabilities by interacting with heterogeneous actors.

Two needs emerge 1. Guaranteeing organizational efficiency and 2. Exploiting effectively market opportunity. This usually implies the integration of knowledge in technology transfer which can be accrued via the knowledge sharing between parties. However, by looking into the technological and social change literature, previous studies were mainly focused on macro-foundation of technology transfer and organizational innovative capabilities with less consideration to the role of psychological precursors of collaborations. Due to this gap, we intended to build a consistent conceptual basis for collaborations and technology transfer practices at the micro level. Therefore, drawing on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) we propose a micro-foundation model for collaborative innovation and technology transfer.

Choi S., Park K.B., Shim S.-O.;Comparing validity of risk measures on newsvendor models in open innovation perspective;2018;In the era of Industry 4.0, firms are facing with greater uncertainty. Accordingly, it is important to select quality risk measures to analyze newsvendor problems under risk. Then, open innovation can be a good remedial option for such risk-averse newsvendors because open innovation can offset the profit losses from risk aversion by sharing revenues in supply chains. To find such risk measures in newsvendor problems, we review various risk measures of risk-averse inventory models and existing articles in inventory management literature. Then we provide a logical reasoning and axiomatic framework to evaluate validity of each risk measure in newsvendor problems - consistency to the four axioms in coherent risk measures. In this framework, the underlying assumptions and managerial insights to the newsvendor problems are examined for each risk measure. Consequently, exponential utility function and coherent measures of risk are selected as two plausible risk measures to analyze multi-product risk-averse newsvendor models. © The Author(s).;In the era of Industry 4.0, firms are facing with greater uncertainty.

However, in the last decade there is a growing trend of MNEs going emerging markets such as India and China. Beside this, sourcing knowledge from globally dispersed knowledge hubs is also one of the major motives of this emerging trend.

This study has investigated the linkage patterns of foreign firms in India from an in-house developed database. The ICT sector is considered as a test case to investigate the linkages of foreign firms with the Indian entities. The study observed that most of the foreign firms are collaborating with the other foreign firms located in India. Next to the foreign firms, Indian firms are preferable compared to university or government research institutes. It shows that industry-academia linkages are quite weak in India. Foreign firms' embededness with the local innovation system is only by linking with the local firms. Although, India has very strong government research laboratories, these are not playing important role in collaborating with the foreign firms. From the policy perspective, industry - academia linkages needs to be strengthened. MNEs enter markets such as India not only for potential markets and 'cheap' skilled human resources but also for knowledge and technology base emerging in the knowledge hubs of these countries.

"Maze, A; Domenech, AC; Goldringer, I";Commoning the seeds: alternative models of collective action and open innovation within French peasant seed groups for recreating local knowledge commons;2020;"In this article, we expand the analytical and theoretical foundations of the study of knowledge commons in the context of more classical agrarian commons, such as seed commons. We show that it is possible to overcome a number of criticisms of earlier work by Ostrom (Governing the commons. The evolution of institutions for collective action, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990) on natural commons and its excludability/rivalry matrix in addressing the inclusive social practices of ""commoning"", defined as a way of living and acting for the preservation of the commons. Our empirical analysis emphasizes, using the most recent advances in the IAD/SES framework, the distributed and collaborative knowledge governance in a French peasant seed network as a key driver for reintroducing cultivated agrobiodiversity and on-farm seed conservation of ancient and landrace varieties. These inclusive peasant seed groups developed alternative peer-to-peer models of collaborative peasant-led community-based breeding and grassroots innovations in the search for more resilient population varieties. Our results highlight the various models of collective action within the network and discuss the organizational tradeoffs of opting out of peasant seed activities and recreating a shared collective knowledge base on the benefits of restoring cultivated agrobiodiversity.

We show that it is possible to overcome a number of criticisms of earlier work by Ostrom (Governing the commons. The evolution of institutions for collective action, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990) on natural commons and its excludability/rivalry matrix in addressing the inclusive social practices of ""commoning"", defined as a way of living and acting for the preservation of the commons.

Xia T., Roper S.;Unpacking Open Innovation: Absorptive Capacity, Exploratory and Exploitative Openness, and the Growth of Entrepreneurial Biopharmaceutical Firms;2016;In this article, we explore the relationship between two key aspects of open innovation in small firms—absorptive capacity (ACAP) and external relationships—and their effects on growth in the U.S. and European biopharmaceutical sectors. Results from an international sample of 349 biopharmaceutical firms surveyed in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany suggest that realized ACAP plays an important role in determining firms’ growth. In terms of the interaction between firms’ ACAP and external relationships, we find that engagement with exploratory relationships depends strongly on the continuity of R&D, while participation in exploitative relationships is more conditional on firms’ realized ACAP. © 2016 International Council for Small Business;In this article, we explore the relationship between two key aspects of Open Innovation in small firms—absorptive capacity (ACAP) and external relationships—and their effects on growth in the U.S. and European biopharmaceutical sectors.

Research on open innovation has been mushrooming ever since and the scope has been broadened in different directions. Researchers also started to analyse open innovation at different level of analysis from the individual actors in organisations to ecosystems and national innovation systems. Despite the vast growth in research on open innovation, we identified several directions for further research: open innovation research should be linked to other management areas such as marketing, HRM, change management, etc. In addition, our understanding of open innovation could be improved if the recently developed insights could be related to the existing management theories.

Brunswicker S., Vanhaverbeke W.;Open Innovation in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs): External Knowledge Sourcing Strategies and Internal Organizational Facilitators;2015;In this paper we explore how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engage in external knowledge sourcing, a form of inbound open innovation. We draw upon a sample of 1,411 SMEs and empirically conceptualize a typology of strategic types of external knowledge sourcing, namely minimal, supply-chain, technology-oriented, application-oriented, and full-scope sourcing. Each strategy reflects the nature of external interactions and is linked to a distinct mixture of four internal practices for managing innovation. Both full-scope and application-oriented sourcing offer performance benefits and are associated with a stronger focus on managing innovation.

Triguero Á., Córcoles D., Fernández S.;Influence of open innovation strategies on employment dynamics: evidence for Spanish manufacturing firms;2020;In this paper, we explore the influence of different modes of openness of innovative firms on employment growth. Using a panel database of Spanish manufacturing firms during the period 1998–2015, we analyze the influence open innovation (OI) strategies on employment distinguishing by type of external partner. The main objective of the research is to know whether opening innovation strategy contributes to employment taken into account another firm capabilities and sectorial technological opportunities. For this purpose, a two-step procedure is specified. Firstly, a random-effect computes the effects of OI on the innovation probability. In the second step, the variation of innovativeness due to openness on GMM-system estimation controlling by potential endogeneity and unobserved firm heterogeneity is used. The results support that the influence of open strategy on employment growth is positive. Moreover, the employment depends on the breadth of OI measured by the number of out-inbound relationships.

Mei L., Zhang T., Chen J.;Exploring the effects of inter-firm linkages on SMEs' open innovation from an ecosystem perspective: An empirical study of Chinese manufacturing SMEs;2019;In this paper, we study the effects of inter-firm linkages on the open innovation of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from an innovation ecosystem perspective. Based on resource dependence theory and the bipartite structure of business ecosystems, we divide a SME's external linkages with its partners in an innovation ecosystem into two types (i.e. the Linkages of a SME with its Prominent Organizations (LPO) and the Linkages of the SME with its Service Intermediaries (LSI)). We then examine the relationships between LPO (and LSI) and the SME's innovation performance and analyze the influences of the SME's absorptive capacity on the two relationships. Research results support a positive relationship between LPO and SMEs' innovation performance, and a positive relationship between LSI and SMEs' innovation performance and a positive relationship between LSI and LPO. In addition, research results show that when measured by R&D intensity, SMEs' absorptive capacity weakens the positive effects of LPO (and LSI) on SMEs' innovation performance, whereas when measured by IT adoption, SMEs' absorptive capacity strengthens the two positive relationships. Relevant theoretical and managerial contributions are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;In this paper, we study the effects of inter-firm linkages on the Open Innovation of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from an innovation ecosystem perspective.

Gemünden H.G., Salomo S., Hölzle K.;Role models for radical innovations in times of open innovation;2007;In this paper, we study the influence of innovator roles in highly innovative ventures. In order to obtain a differentiated picture we take into account the degree of innovativeness as a moderating variable. To test our hypotheses we use a sample of 146 highly innovative new product development projects. We choose a rigorous sampling design and apply state-of-the-art measures for the degree of innovativeness. Furthermore, we apply multi-trait-multi-method methodology (MTMM) to enhance the validity of our study. The results show that innovator roles have a strong influence on innovation success but these influences are positively and negatively moderated by innovativeness. The moderating influences depend on the type of innovativeness. Remarkably, with increasing technological innovativeness innovator roles which create inter-organizational links with the outside world appear to be more important than intra-organizational linker roles, and support from high-ranked organizational members turns out to have a significant negative effect on project success with higher degrees of technological innovativeness. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed and consequences for innovation research and innovation management are shown. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;In this paper, we study the influence of innovator roles in highly innovative ventures.

Following a qualitative study based on visits, archival analysis and interviews with SP professionals located in Brazil and Portugal, we may report that SPs promote OI by spontaneous mechanisms, deliberate actions, and as PP vectors. Furthermore, PPs promote OI in SPs both directly and indirectly. In our comparative analysis, we take into consideration the differences between the two countries. We also introduce a framework that integrates PPs, OI and SPs.

We argue that business accelerators play a critical role within an emerging entrepreneurial ecosystem. Our analysis draws on qualitative data from a business accelerator in such a context. We suggest that, in environments that have underdeveloped entrepreneurial support ecosystems, public policy should endorse the open innovation activities of key actors in entrepreneurial ecosystems. By harnessing open innovation, an accelerator forges a broader network of relationships with actors outside of the system, which in turn increases the capacity within the system and embeds it within a global innovation system. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;In this study, we use the Open Innovation paradigm to analyze the development of an entrepreneurial support ecosystem.

Jasimuddin S.M., Naqshbandi M.M.;Knowledge infrastructure capability, absorptive capacity and inbound open innovation: evidence from SMEs in France;2019;Inbound open innovation (IOI) has become a potentially valuable means of gaining competitive advantage and enhancing organizational performance. This article explores how knowledge infrastructure capability (KIC) affects IOI through the moderating role of absorptive capacity. This research conceptualizes and develops three dimensions of KIC (technological, structural and cultural), and tests the relationships between KIC, absorptive capacity and IOI. Data for the study were collected from 125 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) based in France, and the relationships proposed in the framework were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate that higher levels of KIC can lead to enhanced absorptive capacity and improved IOI. That is, KIC can have a direct, positive impact on absorptive capacity and IOI. Moreover, absorptive capacity partially mediates the linkage between KIC and IOI. The article contributes to the conceptualization of the impact of KIC on IOI, by emphasizing a firm’s absorptive capacity. It offers a validated instrument to measure KIC, and provides an empirical evidence of the impact of KIC on absorptive capacity and IOI. This article also extends the extant literature by focusing on KIC and absorptive capacity simultaneously in a model to understand the notion of IOI in the SMEs based in France. This study offers useful guidance for measuring and implementing KIC in a SME context and encourages further research in this area. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Inbound Open Innovation (IOI) has become a potentially valuable means of gaining competitive advantage and enhancing organizational performance.

Lyu Y., He B., Zhu Y., Li L.;Network embeddedness and inbound open innovation practice: The moderating role of technology cluster;2019;Inbound open innovation has become a prevalent innovation strategy used to strengthen firms' technology competitiveness in the fast-changing industrial and technological environment. The effective governance of firms' ego-centered innovation networks to facilitate and accelerate inbound open innovation practice is the main concern of scholars and firm leaders. In this paper, we elucidate the impact of network embeddedness on inbound open innovation practice by considering technology cluster an important moderator. We conduct a patent citation network analysis and a hierarchical regression analysis to empirically study the patent citation data of four emerging high-tech industries according to the stages of their industrial technology development. Our results show that during the initial and growth stages of industrial technology development, the centrality and network reach of a firm's network embeddedness exert a positive impact on the inbound open innovation practice. This relationship is positively moderated by clustering and the bridging ties of the technology cluster in which the firm is involved. During the stable stage, only the network reach improves firms' inbound open innovation practice, while centrality becomes a hazard. Furthermore, clustering decreases the negative effect of centrality and enhances the positive effect of network reach. Bridging ties show no moderating effect. Our findings deepen the understanding of scholars and practitioners regarding how inbound open innovation practice varies in different innovation network settings at both the firm and cluster levels. © 2019;Inbound Open Innovation has become a prevalent innovation strategy used to strengthen firms' technology competitiveness in the fast-changing industrial and technological environment.

Bröring S.;Developing innovation strategies for convergence - Is 'open innovation' imperative?;2010;Industrial change leading to industry convergence can be observed in many industries. This is provoked by the application of new technologies across industry boundaries, changing customer structures and regulations. Convergence presents a particular context for innovation and technology management, as firms face new bodies of technological and market knowledge which may create competence gaps. This paper asks the following question: what kind of innovation strategies do players with different industry backgrounds employ to address new industry segments resulting from industry convergence? By analysing three different industry cases of convergence, this paper explores how firms in different industries address competence gaps they face by positioning themselves in a newly emerging value chain. Empirical findings indicate that the innovation strategies which firms follow in converging industries may create conflicts with existing path-dependencies. Hence, to overcome these conflicts, open innovation built on dynamic capabilities (like alliance building) plays a major role in industry convergence.

Based on the experience of coordinating the UniversiaG10 project, the Social Web platform of the 2nd Universia International Meeting of Rectors, this article proposes some innovations and elements that justify the need to move towards true e-governance of universities. Drawing on the design and results of this project, we review the bases of sociability on the Web by taking account of grassroots movements and new hybrid models of interaction on social networks, both on- and offline. Building on these experiences and a critical analysis of them, we consider ways to nudge towards open-innovation processes in higher education institutions by taking the dynamics of participation in the Social Web as the point of reference. In particular, two cases of socioeducational innovation stemming from the actions implemented while the project was running are conceptualised: firstly, the institutionalisation of participatory logics and, secondly, community-based dynamics. The conclusions highlight the opportunity to move towards e-governance models in universities in order to integrate open innovation and university-community participation dynamics through social technologies.;Information technology-based social spaces can open up new ways to facilitate the university community's participation in decision-making processes.

Building on these experiences and a critical analysis of them, we consider ways to nudge towards open-innovation processes in higher education institutions by taking the dynamics of participation in the Social Web as the point of reference. In particular, two cases of socioeducational innovation stemming from the actions implemented while the project was running are conceptualised: firstly, the institutionalisation of participatory logics and, secondly, community-based dynamics. The conclusions highlight the opportunity to move towards e-governance models in universities in order to integrate Open Innovation and university-community participation dynamics through social technologies.;;2-s2.0-84856428807;Spain;0;Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1

Open innovation has the potential to accelerate the development of new or improved healthcare solutions. Building on work system theory (WST), this paper explores how a multi-sided open innovation platform can systematically be established in a German med tech industry cluster in situations where firms had no prior experience with this approach. We aim to uncover problems that may arise and identify opportunities for overcoming them. We performed an action research study in which we implemented and evaluated a multi-sided web-based open innovation platform in four real-world innovation challenges. Analyzing the four different challenges fostered a deeper understanding of the conceptual and organizational aspects of establishing the multi-sided open innovation platform as part of a larger work system. Reflecting on the findings, we developed five design principles that shall support the establishment of multi-sided open innovation platforms in other contexts. Thus, this paper contributes to both theory and practice. © 2019, The Author(s).;Innovation in the medical technology (med tech) industry has a major impact on well-being in society.

Choi H., Jeon Y., Park H., Nah K.;Collaborative workshop between client and agency for open innovation;2018;Innovation should be promoted by effectively managing the human factors. In the past, efforts have been made aiming to innovate by utilizing either internal or external resources. In order to innovate, there needs a circumstance where ideas can overflow as many as possible, and to look at the problem from various perspectives to find possible solutions. In this context, some discussions have arisen on how to effectively communicate and share ideas between client and agency. It is expected that collaborative workshop model can become an appropriate solution for this object. It is necessary to define a new relationship between client and agency conducive to solve design problems. To such a degree, collaborative workshop would be an effective method for achieving open innovation. This research was conducted on this key question - How the client and agency as collaborative partner can co-create innovation? How the collaborative workshop can influence the open innovation? What is the purpose of collaborative workshop? What is the process would be like? How the collaborative workshop can influence the relationship between client and agency? The research framework is as follows. Based on a literature review on the issue of collaborative workshop for open innovation, three case studies of collaborative workshop were conducted. With organizations like Crown Haiti, ISTN and Museum San among different backgrounds and workshop objectives, the results of their collaborative workshop and its processes have been compared and analyzed. In order to understand the process and its effects in collaborative workshops, a set of keywords that can describe all the behaviors and objectives in the process of three workshops are discovered. It is observed that all the keywords can be classified into several groups. This is compiled into four categories - enhancing common understanding, accelerating ideation, rapid testing, and sharing direction. The collaborative workshop model has brought forth that maps the goals and process of the collaborative workshop. It is necessary to concisely follow through each step at each category of the workshop.

Stephan U., Andries P., Daou A.;Goal Multiplicity and Innovation: How Social and Economic Goals Affect Open Innovation and Innovation Performance;2019;Integrating insights from the strategic goal literature and the knowledge-based view of the firm, this article proposes that the pursuit of social and economic strategic goals by commercial firms affects their innovation performance through different knowledge sourcing activities. The strategic goals, knowledge sourcing practices, and innovation performance of 1257 Belgian firms are investigated. Results show that both social and economic strategic goals are associated with the use of external information sources, but only the pursuit of social goals inspires firms to engage in external collaboration. No evidence is found of an inherent conflict between social and economic strategic goals. Instead, the two types of goals are independent of each other, that is, an emphasis on social goals does not preclude an emphasis on economic goals and vice versa. Moreover, firms’ external knowledge sourcing and innovation performance benefit most when strongly held social goals align with strongly held economic goals. These findings offer new insight into the nature and the effects of goal multiplicity among commercial firms. They open up a new perspective on the potential positive effects of the joint pursuit of social and economic strategic goals instead of seeing them as inherently conflicting, as past research has typically done. We illustrate how social strategic goals can deliver unique benefits to a firm, independently of and in addition to economic strategic goals. Our findings also contribute to the open innovation literature by revealing strategic goals as a driver of firms’ knowledge sourcing practices. Our findings suggest that solely emphasizing economic goals may be one reason why firms struggle to implement open innovation practices and do not reap their full benefits. The practical implications of our research are discussed. © 2019 Product Development & Management Association;Integrating insights from the strategic goal literature and the knowledge-based view of the firm, this article proposes that the pursuit of social and economic strategic goals by commercial firms affects their innovation performance through different knowledge sourcing activities.

Barrena-Martínez J., Cricelli L., Ferrándiz E., Greco M., Grimaldi M.;Joint forces: Towards an integration of intellectual capital theory and the open innovation paradigm;2020;Intellectual capital (IC) is among the most long-lived topics in managerial literature. More recently, the emergence of the open innovation (OI) paradigm has encouraged the understanding that firms should collaborate with other organizations to leverage their own R&D capabilities. We propose that these two streams of managerial literature should join forces since the OI paradigm could be considered an approach to innovation with foundations in relational capital, facilitated by an appropriate level of human and structural capital. Surprisingly, only a few researchers have put IC and OI into relation. Therefore, this paper has two main goals: providing a theoretical model that synoptically presents how IC and OI overlap and testing the theoretical model by analyzing how firms’ IC affects OI-related performance. We analyze a sample of 3744 Spanish firms. We find that the three IC constructs positively affect OI performance, with relational and human capital subject to diminishing returns. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;Intellectual capital (IC) is among the most long-lived topics in managerial literature.

Here we summarize these opportunities, which include more research on outbound OI, the role of open innovation in services, and network forms of collaboration such as consortia, communities, ecosystems, and platforms. Research should also examine the use of OI by small, new, and not-for-profit organizations, as well as the linkage of individual actions and motivations to open innovation. Other opportunities include better measuring the costs, benefits, antecedents, mediators and moderators of the effects of OI on performance, and understanding why and how OI is rejected, abandoned, or fails.

Based on organizational learning and open innovation literature, we extend the model hypothesizing that the search strategy itself is impacted by firm context. That is, both 'constraints on the application of firm resources' and the 'abundance of external knowledge' have a direct impact on innovative performance and a firm's search strategy in terms of breadth and depth. Based on a survey of Swiss-based firms, we find that constraints decrease and external knowledge increases innovative performance. Although constraints lead to a broader but shallower search, external knowledge is associated with the breadth and the depth of the search in a U-shaped relationship.

Badir Y.F., Frank B., Bogers M.;Employee-level open innovation in emerging markets: linking internal, external, and managerial resources;2020;Leveraging external sources of knowledge has become a vital element of innovation strategy, especially in emerging markets, where many firms lack the sophisticated knowledge required to innovate. However, extant research in this domain puts little emphasis on emerging economies and also typically treats openness as a firm-level concept. In contrast, this study investigates how individual employees rely on both internal and external knowledge to increase their innovative work output (and, secondarily, their customer acquisition performance) and how their supervising manager’s characteristics moderate these mechanisms. Using hierarchical linear modeling of data collected from 123 employees and 50 managers in telecommunications companies in the emerging market of Vietnam, we find support for our hypothesized relationships. These findings have important implications for research and practice as they highlight the role of the individual employee in open innovation, the need for considering a more distributed set of organizational functions, and the relevance for emerging markets. © 2019, The Author(s).;Leveraging external sources of knowledge has become a vital element of innovation strategy, especially in emerging markets, where many firms lack the sophisticated knowledge required to innovate.

Ball Z., Lewis K.;Mass collaboration project recommendation within open-innovation design networks;2019;Mass collaboration within the design engineering process supports the inclusion of unique perspectives when working on complex problems. Increasing the number of individuals providing input and support into these perplexing challenges can increase innovation, decrease product development times, and provide solutions that truly encompass the needs of the market. One of the greatest challenges within mass collaboration engineering projects is the organization of individuals within these large design efforts. Understanding which projects would most effectively benefit from additional designers or contributors is paramount to supporting mass collaboration design networks. Within such networks, there exists a large number of contributors as well as a large pool of potential projects. Matching individuals with the projects that they can provide the greatest benefit to or building a team of individuals for newly developed projects requires the consideration of previous performance and an understanding of individual competencies and design abilities. This work presents a framework which recommends individual project placement based on individual abilities and the project requirements. With this work, a pool of individuals and potential projects are simulated, and the application of a hybrid recommender system is explored. To complement the simulation, an additional case study with empirical data is performed to study the potential applicability of the proposed framework. Overall, it was found that recommended team compositions greatly outperform the baseline team development, most notably as greater consideration is placed on collaborative recommendations.

Munir H., Runeson P., Wnuk K.;How Companies Use OSS Tools Ecosystems for Open Innovation;2019;Moving toward the open innovation (OI) model requires multifaceted transformations within companies. It often involves giving away the tools for product development or sharing future product directions with open tools ecosystems. Moving from the traditional closed innovation model toward an OI model for software development tools shows the potential to increase software development competence and efficiency of organizations. We report a case study in software-intensive company developing embedded devices (e.g., smartphones) followed by a survey in OSS communities such as Gerrit, Git, and Jenkins. The studied branch focuses on developing Android phones. This paper presents contribution strategies and triggers for openness. These strategies include avoid forking OSS tools, empower developers to participate in the ecosystem, steer ecosystems through contributions, create business through differentiation, and create new ecosystems. The triggers of openness are from 30 different companies with examples.

Al-Belushi K.I.A., Stead S.M., Gray T., Burgess J.G.;Measurement of open innovation in the marine biotechnology sector in Oman;2018;National economies are often strengthened by diversification, which is built in turn on a healthy and productive culture of national innovation. Innovation is a complex process, which is difficult to measure in an objective manner. In this work and for the first time, a quantitative measure for open innovation has been developed and validated to determine the performance of a firm within the marine biotechnology sector in Oman. This breakthrough was achieved in four steps. First, the characteristics of the two dimensions of open innovation (‘breadth’ and ‘depth’) were identified using a critical review of the literature and a series of pre-tests of a survey design with industrial experts. Second, a quantitative index for open innovation by measuring these two dimensions at firm level was developed. Third, validation of this five-item scale was conducted using the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) data set. Fourth, the five-item scale was applied to 22 firms in the marine bio-industry sector in Oman using a case study approach, and was used to rank the firms according to their open innovation index. This analysis shows how Omani marine bio-industry firms could strengthen their open innovation efforts, for example by collaborating more effectively with government organizations and research institutes to thereby boost the quality of their open innovation activities in a measurable way. © 2018 The Authors;National economies are often strengthened by diversification, which is built in turn on a healthy and productive culture of national innovation.

There is a general intuition that communication and collaboration, especially mixed with Web 2.0 approach within companies and ecosystems, can boost the innovation process with positive impacts on business indicators. Open Innovation within an Enterprise 2.0 context is a one of the most chosen paradigm for improving the innovation processes of enterprises, based on the collaborative creation and development of ideas and products. The key feature of this new paradigm is that the knowledge is exploited in a collaborative way flowing not only among internal sources, i.e. R&D departments, but also among external ones as other employees, customers, partners, etc. In this paper we show how an ontology-based analysis of plain text can provide a semantic contextualization of content support tasks, such as finding semantic distance between contents, and can help in creating relations between people with shared knowledge and interests.

Integrating econometric analysis into energy research with social science ramifications, this paper relies on bivariate ordered probit regression to study the impact of youths’ interests in the biosphere on their awareness and optimism toward NPT in the UAE. The model is estimated using maximum likelihood methods, with the results showing each level increase in UAE youths’ biospheric interests, to increase their NPT awareness by 13.5%, while conjointly reducing their optimistic expectations toward the technology by 2.4%. In addition, awareness and expectations about NPT are found to vary heterogeneously across the seven Emirates of the country. Moreover, accounting for all relevant factors (including respondents’ biospheric interests), formed expectations about NPT are not significantly shaped by NPT awareness. Given that the first unit of the UAE’s nuclear power plant “Barakah” just became operational in August 2020, our results provide important insights for evidence-based policy making to sustain the nascent nuclear energy program in the long run. © 2020 by the author.

Cassiman B., Valentini G.;Open innovation: Are inbound and outbound knowledge flows really complementary?;2016;"One novel implication of the open innovation paradigm is that inflows and outflows of knowledge are complementary. We argue that engaging simultaneously in buying and selling knowledge should allow firms to increase innovation outcomes.

Empirically, however, we find no evidence for such complementarity in a sample of Belgian manufacturing firms. Firms buying and selling knowledge do increase their sales of new products, but at the same time their R&D costs increase more than proportionally.

Olmedilla M., Send H., Toral S.L.;Identification of the unique attributes and topics within Smart Things Open Innovation Communities;2019;One of the main challenges of open innovation communities is how to create value from shared content either by selecting those ideas that are worthy of pursuit and implementation or by identifying the users' preferences and needs. These tasks can be done manually when there is an overseeable amount of content or by using computational tools when there are massive amounts of data. However, previous studies on text mining have not dealt with the identification of unique attributes, which can be defined as those contributions that are inextricably linked with a specific tag or category within open innovation websites. The uniqueness of these ideas means that they can only be obtained through a selection of one choice among several alternatives. To obtain such unique ideas and thus to also obtain innovations, this paper proposes a novel methodology called co-occurrence differential analysis. The proposed methodology combines traditional co-occurrence analysis with additional statistical processing to obtain the unique attributes and topics associated with different alternatives. The identification of unique content provides valuable information that can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of several options in a comparative fashion. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;One of the main challenges of Open Innovation communities is how to create value from shared content either by selecting those ideas that are worthy of pursuit and implementation or by identifying the users' preferences and needs.

Mergel I.;Opening Government: Designing Open Innovation Processes to Collaborate With External Problem Solvers;2015;Open government initiatives in the U.S. government focus on three main aspects: transparency, participation, and collaboration. Especially the collaboration mandate is relatively unexplored in the literature. In practice, government organizations recognize the need to include external problem solvers into their internal innovation creation processes. This is partly derived from a sense of urgency to improve the efficiency and quality of government service delivery. Another formal driver is the America Competes Act that instructs agencies to search for opportunities to meaningfully promote excellence in technology, education, and science. Government agencies are responding to these requirements by using open innovation (OI) approaches to invite citizens to crowdsource and peer produce solutions to public management problems. These distributed innovation processes occur at all levels of the U.S. government and it is important to understand what design elements are used to create innovative public management ideas. This article systematically reviews existing government crowdsourcing and peer production initiatives and shows that after agencies have defined their public management problem, they go through four different phases of the OI process: (1) idea generation through crowdsourcing, (2) incubation of submitted ideas with peer voting and collaborative improvements of favorite solutions, (3) validation with a proof of concept of implementation possibilities, and (4) reveal of the selected solution and the (internal) implementation of the winning idea. Participation and engagement are incentivized both with monetary and nonmonetary rewards, which lead to tangible solutions as well as intangible innovation outcomes, such as increased public awareness. © 2014, © The Author(s) 2014.;Open government initiatives in the U.S. government focus on three main aspects: transparency, participation, and collaboration.

In software engineering (SE), OI has existed for decades, while we currently see a faster and broader move towards OI in SE. We therefore survey research on how OI takes place and contributes to innovation in SE. This study aims to synthesize the research knowledge on OI in the SE domain. We launched a systematic mapping study and conducted a thematic analysis of the results. Moreover, we analyzed the strength of the evidence in the light of a rigor and relevance assessment of the research. We identified 33 publications, divided into 9 themes related to OI. 17/33 studies fall in the high–rigor/high–relevance category, suggesting the results are highly industry relevant. The research indicates that start-ups have higher tendency to opt for OI compared to incumbents. The evidence also suggests that firms assimilating knowledge into their internal R&D activities, have higher likelihood of gaining financial advantages. We concluded that OI should be adopted as a complementary approach to facilitate internal innovation and not to substitute it. Further research is advised on situated OI strategies and the interplay between OI and agile practices. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;Open Innovation means that innovation is fostered by using both external and internal influences in the innovation process.

Marullo C., Di Minin A., De Marco C., Piccaluga A.;Is open innovation always the best for SMEs? An exploratory analysis at the project level;2020;Open innovation (OI) projects are increasingly adopted by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Yet, undertaking OI is not only a source of opportunities for SMEs as it can, at the same time, present risks. How SMEs manage the balance between the potential benefits and the emerging challenges of OI is still an overlooked topic in the literature. Using evidence gathered through multiple case studies and drawing upon the relational view of the firm, we explore how and why value creation opportunities and different managerial challenges emerge for SMEs pursuing OI projects. We analyze different stages of OI projects in several different contexts of their implementation. Our analysis sheds light on the different nature and dynamics of knowledge involved within OI projects as important boundary conditions affecting successful search paths, learning processes, and the development of appropriability mechanisms. By offering a contextualized view of OI in SMEs, this study also provides insights to business managers on the situational opportunities and constraints of OI, including managerial suggestions on actions to manage tensions within differing OI projects. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;Open Innovation projects are increasingly adopted by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Yet, undertaking OI is not only a source of opportunities for SMEs as it can, at the same time, present risks. How SMEs manage the balance between the potential benefits and the emerging challenges of OI is still an overlooked topic in the literature. Using evidence gathered through multiple case studies and drawing upon the relational view of the firm, we explore how and why value creation opportunities and different managerial challenges emerge for SMEs pursuing OI projects. We analyze different stages of OI projects in several different contexts of their implementation.

Hofstetter R., Zhang J.Z., Herrmann A.;Successive Open Innovation Contests and Incentives: Winner-Take-All or Multiple Prizes?;2018;Open innovation contests are a popular way to tap into the creativity of customers. Many firms host multiple, successive open innovation contests in response to different, creative challenges they face. To encourage customers to participate and make an effort in such contests, they offer monetary rewards of varying sizes. Although prior research has investigated the optimal reward design for one-time contests, little is known about how the rewards offered in a contest can influence individuals’ ongoing level of participation and their creative effort in subsequent contests. Receiving a reward is a form of positive competence feedback that influences individuals’ feelings of competence and intrinsic motivation. Based on cognitive evaluation theory, we argue that these feelings can persist after a contest ends, influencing positively participation and creative efforts in later contests. Our online experiment and also our analysis of the data from an actual open innovation platform show that individuals tend to cease participating in subsequent contests, significantly reducing the size of the crowd over time. Receiving a reward and positive competence feedback alleviates this tendency. Therefore, offering more prizes motivates more high-performing individuals to participate again and to put in more creative effort, which in turn raise the average quality as well as the best quality in subsequent contests. These findings suggest that in successive open innovation contests, multiple rewards not only encourage greater participation, but also promote better quality outcomes. Thus, firms are well advised to expand the positive reward feedback in contests, as doing so will help them to maintain a sizable and motivated crowd of contestants. © 2017 Product Development & Management Association;Open Innovation contests are a popular way to tap into the creativity of customers.

Hofstetter R., Dahl D.W., Aryobsei S., Herrmann A.;Constraining Ideas: How Seeing Ideas of Others Harms Creativity in Open Innovation;2021;Open innovation contests that display all submitted ideas to participants are a popular way for firms to generate ideas. In such contest-based ideation, the authors show that seeing numerous competitive ideas of others harms, rather than stimulates, creative performance (Study 1). Others’ competitive prior ideas interfere with idea generation, as new ideas need to be differentiated from the preceding ones to be original. Exposure to an increasing number of prior ideas thus heightens individuals’ perceived constraints of expressing ideas and harms creative performance (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, creative performance monotonically reduces with an increasing number of prior ideas (Study 4). A final study demonstrates that showing only a limited number of ideas as well as grouping prior ideas offer actionable ways to reduce prior ideas’ harmful influence (Study 5). These results illustrate viable ways to improve contest-based ideation outcomes merely by changing how competitive prior ideas are presented. © The Author(s) 2020.;Open Innovation contests that display all submitted ideas to participants are a popular way for firms to generate ideas.

Effective management of the knowledge and information transferred between ecosystem partners is crucial for the process of open innovation. However, to date, limited research has focused on ascertaining the conditions required for knowledge transfer success, particularly where the context involves collaboration between diverse organizational actors. Correspondingly, this study extends existing knowledge by presenting an exploration of conditions for knowledge transfer success between ecosystem partners. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirty key stakeholders in order to acquire their perceptions of the presence of specific conditions within their ecosystem partnerships. Empirical data were analyzed using a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis approach, resulting in the production of success recipes from multinational, small and medium-sized enterprise, and academic institution perspectives. Results indicate that combinations of knowledge, relationship, and organizational characteristics contribute to knowledge transfer success. However, these combinations are found to be dependent on the type of ecosystem partnership involved.

Chesbrough H., Lettl C., Ritter T.;Value Creation and Value Capture in Open Innovation;2018;Open innovation has attracted a significant amount of attention from scholars and practitioners. Prior research on open innovation has mainly focused on collaborative inventing. However, understanding the processes and outcomes of joint inventing is not sufficient for understanding sustained open-innovation activities and the competitive advantages of the actors involved in open innovation. Instead, an understanding of value creation and value capture is paramount for advancing our understanding of sustained open-innovation activities. Open innovation requires collaboration among distributed but interdependent actors who rely on each other’s capabilities for value creation and capture. Value in open innovation is driven not only by actors’ value creation but also by their ability to capture value. While value creation and value capture are discussed in the open-innovation literature, the advancement of this stream of research is hindered by conceptual ambiguity, especially in relation to the concept of value capture. This article adopts a value perspective on open innovation, offers consistent conceptualizations of value creation and value capture, and outlines potential avenues for further research at the interface of open innovation, value creation, and value capture. © 2018 Product Development & Management Association;Open Innovation has attracted a significant amount of attention from scholars and practitioners.

Although our understanding of this management paradigm has significantly improved over the last few years, a number of important questions are still unanswered. In particular, an issue that deserves further attention is the anatomy of the organizational change process through which a firm evolves from being a Closed to an Open Innovator. The paper represents a first step in overcoming this limitation. In particular, adopting a longitudinal, firm-level perspective, it addresses the following question: which changes in a firm's organizational structures and management systems does the shift from Closed to Open Innovation entail? In answering this question, the paper uses established concepts in organizational change research to look into a rich empirical basis that documents the adoption of Open Innovation by four Italian firms operating in mature, asset-intensive industries. The results show that the journey from Closed to Open Innovation involves four main dimensions of the firm's organization, i.e. inter-organizational networks, organizational structures, evaluation processes and knowledge management systems, along which change could be managed and stimulated. © 2010 The Authors.

The survey furthermore focuses on the motives and perceived challenges when SMEs adopt open innovation practices. Within the survey, open innovation is measured with eight innovation practices reflecting technology exploration and exploitation in SMEs. We find that the responding SMEs engage in many open innovation practices and have increasingly adopted such practices during the past 7 years. In addition, we find no major differences between manufacturing and services industries, but medium-sized firms are on average more heavily involved in open innovation than their smaller counterparts. We furthermore find that SMEs pursue open innovation primarily for market-related motives such as meeting customer demands, or keeping up with competitors. Their most important challenges relate to organizational and cultural issues as a consequence of dealing with increased external contacts. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Kapetaniou C., Lee S.H.;Geographical proximity and open innovation of SMEs in Cyprus;2019;Open innovation implies that geographical proximity is irrelevant. However, we posit that any potential innovation outcome depends on the spatial constraints on openness. In this paper, we add a geographical proximity dimension to open innovation by analysing how a domestic and international open innovation approach affects innovation outcomes. In particular, we hypothesise that domestic open innovation has positive effects on new-to-the-firm product innovation, due to easily accessible resources. We further posit that, through international open innovation, SMEs can access new and advanced knowledge which is not available locally, leading to more novel innovations. However, we expect that the relationship between openness, both domestic and international, and innovation is conditional on R&D activities. Our empirical analysis based on the Cyprus Community Innovation Survey supports these hypotheses. Our results underline the critical role of the spatial aspect on open innovation in SMEs, something which has remained surprisingly absent from the literature. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;Open Innovation implies that geographical proximity is irrelevant.

Pellizzoni E., Trabucchi D., Buganza T.;When agility meets open innovation: two approaches to manage inbound projects;2019;Open Innovation is a leading paradigm in the current landscape, and scholars have been highly focused on defining the characteristics and capabilities that firms need to implement it successfully. This research aims to understand how organizations may implement inbound OI projects. Relying on a multiple case study approach and based on primary and secondary sources, this research highlights two main approaches: team-centred and individual-centred. The two approaches are discussed according to previous studies, highlighting how the first one is particularly coherent with previous research on Open Innovation, while the second one offers great insights from an Agile Project Management perspective. In particular, this research suggests how the Open Innovation literature can be enriched by considering the recent advancements in the Agile literature, valuing the individual and its autonomy to embrace external ideas from an OI perspective. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;Open Innovation is a leading paradigm in the current landscape, and scholars have been highly focused on defining the characteristics and capabilities that firms need to implement it successfully.

West J., Gallagher S.;Challenges of open innovation: The paradox of firm investment in open-source software;2006;Open innovation is a powerful framework encompassing the generation, capture, and employment of intellectual property at the firm level. We identify three fundamental challenges for firms in applying the concept of open innovation: finding creative ways to exploit internal innovation, incorporating external innovation into internal development, and motivating outsiders to supply an ongoing stream of external innovations. This latter challenge involves a paradox, why would firms spend money on R&D efforts if the results of these efforts are available to rival firms? To explore these challenges, we examine the activity of firms in open-source software to support their innovation strategies. Firms involved in open-source software often make investments that will be shared with real and potential rivals. We identify four strategies firms employ - pooled R&Dproduct development, spinouts, selling complements and attracting donated complements - and discuss how they address the three key challenges of open innovation. We conclude with suggestions for how similar strategies may apply in other industries and offer some possible avenues for future research on open innovation. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Open Innovation is a powerful framework encompassing the generation, capture, and employment of intellectual property at the firm level.

Chiaroni D., Chiesa V., Frattini F.;The Open Innovation Journey: How firms dynamically implement the emerging innovation management paradigm;2011;Open Innovation is currently one of the most debated topics in management literature. Nevertheless, there are still many unanswered questions in Open Innovation research. Especially two issues require further investigation: (i) understanding the relevance of Open Innovation beyond high-tech industries and (ii) studying how firms implement Open Innovation in practice. The paper addresses these topics by studying, through an in-depth case study, the journey that the Italian leading cement manufacturer, has undergone to move from a Closed to an Open Innovation paradigm. The paper shows that the Open Innovation paradigm is implemented along a three-phase process that comprises the stages of unfreezing, moving and institutionalising. Moreover, it emerges that the changes through which Open Innovation has been implemented involve four major dimensions, i.e. networks, organisational structures, evaluation processes and knowledge management systems. They should be therefore conceived as the managerial and organisational levers an innovating firm can act upon to streamline its journey toward Open Innovation. Theoretical and managerial implications of using these levers for implementing Open Innovation are discussed at length. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Spaeth S., Stuermer M., Von Krogh G.;Enabling knowledge creation through outsiders: Towards a push model of open innovation;2010;Open innovation is increasingly being adopted in business and describes a situation in which firms exchange ideas and knowledge with external participants, such as customers, suppliers, partner firms, and universities. This article extends the concept of open innovation with a push model of open innovation: knowledge is voluntarily created outside a firm by individuals and organisations who proceed to push knowledge into a firm's open innovation project. For empirical analysis, we examine source code and newsgroup data on the Eclipse Development Platform. We find that outsiders invest as much in the firm's project as the founding firm itself. Based on the insights from Eclipse, we develop four propositions: 'preemptive generosity' of a firm, 'continuous commitment', 'adaptive governance structure', and 'low entry barrier' are contexts that enable the push model of open innovation.

Eservel U.Y.;IT-enabled knowledge creation for open innovation;2014;Open innovation is increasingly important for researchers and practitioners alike. Open innovation is closely linked to knowledge creation in that, with open innovation, knowledge inflows and outflows are exploited for innovation. In the information systems field, open innovation has been closely linked to open source software development teams. However, the literature has not yet identified how open source software development teams use information technologies to create knowledge to bring about open innovation. This study fills in this gap by asking the following research questions: RQ1) How do innovative open source software development teams create knowledge?, and RQ2) What types of information technologies do innovative open source software development teams rely on for enabling knowledge creation? I answer these research questions with a revelatory case study. The findings contribute to the knowledge management theory by identifying how three of the four knowledge creation modes identified by Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) manifest through different behaviors in the IT-enabled open innovation setting compared to behaviors observed in the organizational setting. The findings also contribute to information systems theory by identifying the role of information technologies in enabling knowledge creation for open innovation. This study further provides researchers and practitioners with ways of identifying knowledge creation by analyzing information technology artifacts, such as mailing lists, issue trackers, and software versioning tools. © 2014, Association for Information Systems.

Henkel J., Schöberl S., Alexy O.;The emergence of openness: How and why firms adopt selective revealing in open innovation;2014;Open innovation is often facilitated by strong intellectual property rights (IPRs), but it may also function, and even be boosted, when firms deliberately waive some of their IPRs. Extant literature has pointed out the potential benefits of such behavior, but falls short of explaining what triggers firms to practice it in the first place and to maintain or extend it. Since the waiving of IPRs runs counter to common views on strategy and competition and to engrained practices, this is a non-trivial question. To address it, we conduct an empirical study in a segment of the computer component industry which traditionally has taken a rather proprietary stance. With the advent of the open source operating system Linux, firms increasingly waived their IPRs on software drivers. We trace and analyze this process using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our results indicate that component makers went through a learning process, which led some to realize how selectively waiving IPRs may be beneficial for their business. We uncover customer demand pull as the initial trigger and observe how a positive feedback loop sets in subsequently, leading to a further increase in the use of selective revealing. Overall, we find that openness develops into a new dimension of competition. We discuss the implication of our findings for research on open innovation and highlight how they impact managers in practice. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;Open Innovation is often facilitated by strong intellectual property rights (IPRs), but it may also function, and even be boosted, when firms deliberately waive some of their IPRs.

Barbosa A.P.P.L., Salerno M.S., Brasil V.C., Nascimento P.T.D.S.;Coordination Approaches to Foster Open Innovation R&D Projects Performance;2020;Open innovation R&D projects involve teams from different organizations, which may affect the team's ability to communicate since people are from different locations and companies, which may have different priorities, procedures, goals, and expectations. To succeed in the project, the team needs coordination mechanisms that facilitate teamwork. However, in the open innovation R&D projects, the coordination approach that fosters project performance is not evident. Using structural equation modeling analysis (PLS-SEM) with a sample of 50 open innovation R&D projects, we assessed the relationship with the project performance of two coordination approaches (organic or mechanistic) focusing on the communication strategies used. We find evidence that both organic and mechanistic approaches are positively associated with performance, which means that each approach has its role in fostering the project's performance. Consequently, such projects benefit both from open, continuous, and informal communication flow and from a more formal procedure of sharing information through a clear definition of project objectives, evolution, and challenges.

Martínez-Torres M.R.;Application of evolutionary computation techniques for the identification of innovators in open innovation communities;2013;Open innovation represents an emergent paradigm by which organizations make use of internal and external resources to drive their innovation processes. The growth of information and communication technologies has facilitated a direct contact with customers and users, which can be organized as open innovation communities through Internet. The main drawback of this scheme is the huge amount of information generated by users, which can negatively affect the correct identification of potentially applicable ideas. This paper proposes the use of evolutionary computation techniques for the identification of innovators, that is, those users with the ability of generating attractive and applicable ideas for the organization. For this purpose, several characteristics related to the participation activity of users though open innovation communities have been collected and combined in the form of discriminant functions to maximize their correct classification. The right classification of innovators can be used to improve the ideas evaluation process carried out by the organization innovation team. Besides, obtained results can also be used to test lead user theory and to measure to what extent lead users are aligned with the organization strategic innovation policies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Billington C., Davidson R.;Leveraging open innovation using intermediary networks;2013;Open innovation, fuelled by the rise of the Internet, has made it feasible and cheaper for firms to open themselves up to a wide range of external sources of innovative ideas. The explosive growth of open innovation intermediary networks, such as InnoCentive or Linked-in, enables the rapid pairing of firms seeking knowledge to address a wide range of business challenges (seekers) with other firms or individuals who already have relevant knowledge (solvers or knowledge brokers). These intermediary networks allow procurement departments to source codified and un-codified knowledge from firms or individuals outside their traditional supplier networks using one-off transactional relationships. Although sourcing ideas in this way theoretically poses problems for knowledge search and transfer, we have found that companies can draw on processes and integration mechanisms developed by procurement and design engineering to develop effective organizational learning routines. These routines are strategically vital to source new ideas through open innovation using intermediary networks and create competitive advantage. © 2012 Production and Operations Management Society.;Open Innovation, fuelled by the rise of the Internet, has made it feasible and cheaper for firms to open themselves up to a wide range of external sources of innovative ideas.

Dandonoli, P;Open innovation as a new paradigm for global collaborations in health;2013;Open innovation, which refers to combining internal and external ideas and internal and external paths to market in order to achieve advances in processes or technologies, is an attractive paradigm for structuring collaborations between developed and developing country entities and people. Such open innovation collaborations can be designed to foster true co-creation among partners in rich and poor settings, thereby breaking down hierarchies and creating greater impact and value for each partner. Using an example from Concern Worldwide's Innovations for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health initiative, this commentary describes an early-stage pilot project built around open innovation in a low resource setting, which puts communities at the center of a process involving a wide range of partners and expertise, and considers how it could be adapted and make more impactful and sustainable by extending the collaboration to include developed country partners.;Open Innovation, which refers to combining internal and external ideas and internal and external paths to market in order to achieve advances in processes or technologies, is an attractive paradigm for structuring collaborations between developed and developing country entities and people.

Dries L., Pascucci S., Török A., Tóth J.;Open Innovation: A Case-study of the Hungarian Wine Sector;2013;Open Innovation: A Case-study of the Hungarian Wine Sector An effective innovation system is crucial for food companies to counteract international competitive pressure. An important issue is whether it is more effective to innovate by sharing ideas and resources with other companies, or to innovate in-house. The question is how to arrange external ties without compromising unique knowledge and assets. This is particularly controversial in the wine sector, where innovative marketing strategies have to be combined with 'exclusive' and 'secret' recipes. We use primary data on the Hungarian wine industry. We find that Hungarian wine companies are actively using 'open sources' in their innovation processes, even more than commonly acknowledged in the literature and the policy debate. Furthermore, we find that both regional and company-specific factors affect the openness of innovation processes. Our findings point to the importance of the flow of new ideas that comes from global trends and from dealing with foreign companies and stakeholders. This result is supportive of internationalisation strategies at both company and sector level. Furthermore, our findings are supportive of policies oriented towards the creation of business parks and rural clusters, where farmers, processors and tech-companies can establish networks to create new products and/or processing technologies. © 2013 The Agricultural Economics Society and the European Association of Agricultural Economists.;Open Innovation: A Case-study of the Hungarian Wine Sector An effective innovation system is crucial for food companies to counteract international competitive pressure.

Linåker J., Munir H., Wnuk K., Mols C.E.;Motivating the contributions: An Open Innovation perspective on what to share as Open Source Software;2018;Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystems have reshaped the ways how software-intensive firms develop products and deliver value to customers. However, firms still need support for strategic product planning in terms of what to develop internally and what to share as OSS. Existing models accurately capture commoditization in software business, but lack operational support to decide what contribution strategy to employ in terms of what and when to contribute. This study proposes a Contribution Acceptance Process (CAP) model from which firms can adopt contribution strategies that align with product strategies and planning. In a design science influenced case study executed at Sony Mobile, the CAP model was iteratively developed in close collaboration with the firm's practitioners. The CAP model helps classify artifacts according to business impact and control complexity so firms may estimate and plan whether an artifact should be contributed or not. Further, an information meta-model is proposed that helps operationalize the CAP model at the organization. The CAP model provides an operational OI perspective on what firms involved in OSS ecosystems should share, by helping them motivate contributions through the creation of contribution strategies. The goal is to help maximize return on investment and sustain needed influence in OSS ecosystems. © 2017;Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystems have reshaped the ways how software-intensive firms develop products and deliver value to customers.

Morgan L., Finnegan P.;Open Innovation in Secondary Software Firms: An Exploration of Managers’ Perceptions of Open Source Software;2010;Open source software (OSS) is probably the best known exemplar of open innovation, with many practitioner-oriented publications having debated the merits and drawbacks of OSS in recent years. Nevertheless, much of the academic research on OSS has focused on individual rather than organizational issues. Hence while there is some understanding of why individual developers and users opt for particular OSS applications, relatively little is known about the adoption of OSS as a software acquisition policy. This paper presents a study of 13 managers in the secondary software sector in Europe, and examines how their perceptions of the benefits and drawbacks of OSS affected their decision to adopt an open source policy for software in their companies. The study reveals how their perceptions of the business and technical benefits and drawbacks of OSS influenced the technological, organizational, environmental and individual factors considered within the adoption process. The findings reveal that many of these factors are similar to those reported by previous work on the adoption of innovation, leading us to conclude that organizational processes for the adoption of open innovation are reliant on the practices for closed innovation despite frequently cited loss of organizational control associated with open innovation. © 2010, Authors.

Lopes A.P.V.B.V., de Carvalho M.M.;Evolution of the open innovation paradigm: Towards a contingent conceptual model;2018;Openness has increasingly become a trend in innovation management. This study aims to propose a contingent conceptual framework for open innovation that reflects the evolution of this concept based on the academic literature. Besides, it aims to analyze how open innovation can affect firm and innovation performance. Additionally, it identifies the key contingent variables that affect the relationship between open innovation and performance. To accomplish these objectives, the research design is a systematic literature review, merging bibliometrics, content analysis and mind maps. The bibliometrics was applied to investigate the key references and topics. For the content analysis, a detail-coding schema was developed. Then, a mind map approach was applied towards a contingent conceptual model. Finally, a methodological triangulation was applied for understanding in-depth the insights of these research methods applied. As a result, a contingent conceptual model of open innovation has been developed. In this model, the open innovation construct is an independent variable classified as inbound or outbound, and the dependent variables are firm performance and innovation performance. Moreover, contingent variables (control and moderator) were identified, highlighting the moderate effect of knowledge flow.

This paper explores the diffusion and characteristics of collaborative relationships between universities and industry, and develops a research agenda informed by an 'open innovation' perspective. A framework is proposed, distinguishing university-industry relationships from other mechanisms such as technology transfer or human mobility. On the basis of the existing body of research, the role of practices such as collaborative research, university-industry research centres, contract research and academic consulting is analysed. The evidence suggests that such university-industry relationships are widely practised, whereby differences exist across industries and scientific disciplines.

An Imprinting Perspective on Open Innovation;2019;Our study illustrates how scientists contribute to the performance of innovative start-ups through an analysis of 211 Italian start-ups with and without scientist founders. Building upon imprinting theory, we hypothesize and find that scientists provide an advantage to innovative start-ups to the extent that they stimulate open innovation (i.e., search breadth and depth). However, for this to effectively occur, the involvement of multiple scientist founders is needed, so that their career imprints internalized in the lab are successfully transferred to the start-up. Moreover, if the start-up embraces business practices (i.e., strategic planning) or departs from scientific logics (i.e., pursuing non-commercial goals), scientists’ contribution is further increased. Therefore, our study illustrates how the scientist career imprint can provide an advantage to innovative start-ups with multiple scientists, but also how it can act as a rigidity if the start-up does not pursue strategic planning or emphasizes non-commercial goals. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and Society for the Advancement of Management Studies;Our study illustrates how scientists contribute to the performance of innovative start-ups through an analysis of 211 Italian start-ups with and without scientist founders.

We take a dynamic view of desorptive capacity by studying an entrepreneurial venture's learning process, both internally, in terms of its own technology trajectory, and externally, through inter-organizational alliances. We apply a negative binomial model to our novel panel of 180 firms studied over an 18-year period with controls for stocks of clinical development activities, patenting and prior licensing activities. Empirical analysis enables us to observe the impact which the firms' technological and development status, reputation and desorptive capacity exert upon out-licensing volume. Prior outbound open innovation studies do not account for the heterogeneity of technology and R&D success and failure experiences observed in our study. We also demonstrate the contingency effect of external learning from alliances during the building-up of a firm's desorptive capacity, or the way in which the number of co-authoring partners in scientific publications negatively moderates the positive effect of the number of commercial alliances on the volume of its out-licensing deals. Our findings contribute to the understanding of external knowledge exploitation and complement important aspects of the literatures on outbound open innovation and desorptive capacity, offering empirically rich insights for bio-pharmaceutical firms into the drivers behind volumes of out-licensing deals.

Rangus K., Drnovšek M., Di Minin A.;Proclivity for open innovation: Construct development and empirical validation;2016;Over the past decade, the concept of open innovation has received substantial attention. Research has ranged from case study representations to large-scale quantitative studies using the Community Innovation Survey data or developing novel approaches to measuring open innovation. In this study, we conceptualise and validate a firm-level measure of proclivity for open innovation, which relates to the firm’s predisposition to perform inbound and outbound open innovation activities. To do so, we focus on smaller firms, assessing their organisational and behavioural perspectives related to open innovation. Building on existing scholarly research and a field study, we begin by conceptualising the theoretical framework of the multidimensional construct. We then develop and validate its measurement scale on two cross-cultural samples. The measure contains the following dimensions: inward IP licensing and external participation, outsourcing R&D and external networking, customer involvement, employee involvement, venturing, and outward IP licensing. Our results indicate that the measure has good reliability and validity. Implications for future research are also discussed. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Over the past decade, the concept of Open Innovation has received substantial attention.

"Moellers, T; Visini, C; Haldimann, M";Complementing open innovation in multi-business firms: practices for promoting knowledge flows across internal units;2020;Over the past decades open innovation (OI) practices have gained prominence among both scholars and practitioners as a mean to accelerate time-to-market and reduce development costs of innovations. Thereby scholars have nearly exclusively focused on cross-boundary knowledge flows between the focal firm and (its) external collaborators. This paper argues that such a focus limits our understanding of how multi-business firms with a diverse knowledge base profit from internally applied open innovation practices that in turn provide complementary benefits to OI. We build on the current literature by investigating and describing OI activities that are conducted within the boundaries of the multi-business firm. Based on a multiple case study of 23 collaboration practices conducted across 14 firms, our findings reveal 5 archetypal forms of internally applied open innovation activities. We draw on the literature of cross-divisional innovation and crowdsourcing to highlight how these archetypes differ in terms of their purpose and underlying managerial processes. Multi-business firms regularly rely on internal practices due to lower transaction costs and for stimulating a collaborative culture. We conclude that internally applied OI practices are effectively stimulated by a combination of non-monetary reward systems and purposive integration mechanisms.;Over the past decades Open Innovation practices have gained prominence among both scholars and practitioners as a mean to accelerate time-to-market and reduce development costs of innovations.

Euchner J.;The uses and risks of open innovation;2013;Overview: Current approaches to open innovation can be characterized in two general categories: open-boundary innovation and open-source innovation. Open-boundary innovation is designed to source new technology and concepts broadly without surrendering control of the innovation process, while open-source innovation is a more radical model that challenges fundamental assumptions about the nature of the corporation. The appropriate corporate response to open-source innovation is diffi cult to defi ne, as the risks are unknown.

Lichtenthaler U.;Integrated roadmaps for open innovation;2008;OVERVIEW: In the context of open innovation, firms increasingly acquire technologies from external sources. Moreover, many firms have recently started to actively commercialize technologies, for example, by means of outlicensing. While some pioneering firms realize enormous benefits from this, many others experience major difficulties in managing external technology exploitation. To overcome these challenges, firms need to establish appropriate strategic technology-planning processes. Such processes include the extension of product-technology roadmapping to integrated roadmaps for open innovation processes, including external technology exploitation. This has a number of implications for technology managers, including the need to consider potential returns from a technology as a whole rather than from product sales alone. © 2008 Industrial Research Institute, Inc.;OVERVIEW: In the context of Open Innovation, firms increasingly acquire technologies from external sources.

Granstrand O., Holgersson M.;The challenge of closing open innovation: The intellectual property disassembly problem;2014;OVERVIEW: This article addresses one of the many unexplored challenges associated with closing open innovation-the intellectual property (IP) disassembly problem. This is the problem of disentangling and allocating IP rights at the closing or termination of an open innovation project or when one or more of the vital participants leaves. IP disassembly problems may be mitigated (but not eliminated) through contingent contractual provisions at the IP assembly stage. Moreover, provisions can be made at both the assembly and disassembly stages to prepare for and benefit from subsequent IP reassembly in a sequence of project generations over time.

Lee S.-M., Shin J.;A Path to Collaborative Innovation Through Internal Boundary Breaking: Open innovation tools applied within the organization helped LG Chem Research Park build a culture that nurtures collaborative innovation.;2017;OVERVIEW: This paper describes LG Chem Research Park’s process of transforming a large, closed R&D center into a collaborative organization. Experiments with open innovation intermediaries unveiled internal boundaries, both formal and informal. That experience led the organization’s leadership team to seek ways to “unfreeze” the organizational culture. The internal application of open innovation tools broke down formal boundaries between individuals and teams. Informal communities allowed researchers to build relationships, thereby breaking informal boundaries. Easing researchers’ anxieties about collaboration, and then building researchers’ trust, in others and in the organization’s commitment to collaboration, were crucial cultural shifts. The transition process at LG Chem Research Park can serve as a model to guide R&D organizations seeking to broaden internal collaboration and move toward deeper open innovation.

Brunswicker S., Chesbrough H.;The Adoption of Open Innovation in Large Firms: Practices, Measures, and RisksA survey of large firms examines how firms approach open innovation strategically and manage knowledge flows at the project level.;2018;OVERVIEW: We present a large-sample survey of open innovation adoption and management in large firms, a follow-up to a previous study. We repeat some of the survey measures from the first survey, finding that open innovation continues to be widely practiced in about 80 percent of responding firms. Outside-in open innovation is more often practiced than inside-out. In other words, large firms are net takers of free knowledge flows, in part because they are concerned about IP protection for outbound knowledge. When we added new measures to examine open innovation at the project level, we found that firms selectively manage knowledge flows into and out of projects and are formalizing processes as they move from problem definition to execution. We conclude with observations about the organizational challenges and risks of shifting to an open innovation approach. Copyright © 2018, Innovation Research Interchange.

Sydow J., Müller-Seitz G.;Open innovation at the interorganizational network level – Stretching practices to face technological discontinuities in the semiconductor industry;2020;Previous studies on open innovation have primarily adopted the perspective of single firms. Against this background we explore how open innovation is managed at the network level for the case of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). Using a longitudinal case study, we report on how the ITRS deals with a technological discontinuity affecting the whole industry, namely the pursuit of an existing technological paradigm using a well-established collaborative practice set against a novel and unknown future technological paradigm to be opened up in parallel, even though the necessary knowledge about the ensuing disruption is lacking. This challenge is characterized not only by extreme technological uncertainty, but also by partner-related and procedural uncertainty concerning the key activity of ITRS, namely the setting of future technological milestones (roadmapping). We discuss attempts by the ITRS network to overcome these uncertainties and manage technological discontinuities by extending the well-established practice of roadmapping to an unknown technological paradigm. We introduce the concept of ‘stretching practice’ to highlight this phenomenon, and we contribute to the debate on the open innovation and technological discontinuities that arise when venturing beyond firm-centric approaches. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;Previous studies on Open Innovation have primarily adopted the perspective of single firms.

An empirical investigation of open innovation, external partnerships and firm capabilities in the automotive industry;2015;Prior research on open innovation primarily focused on theoretical perceptions about the transaction of technologies in information technology, pharmaceutical and electronics industry. Research about open innovation in the automotive industry has hardly received attention. However, the automotive industry has long been cooperating with external partners and nowadays acquires about three quarters of the value created from their suppliers. Based on theoretical findings of other industries, we examine the role of technology transactions and external partnerships in fostering firm capabilities. Survey responses from the German automotive industry let us empirically test seven hypotheses with a multiple regression model. Based on a firm's individual resource configuration and capability level, results show that some firms clearly profit more from openness than others.

Bzhalava L., Cantner U.;The journey towards open innovation: why do firms choose different routes?;2018;Prior research on open innovation provides no systematic insight whether firms with internal innovation constraints increase the scale of R&D outsourcing or the number of innovation cooperation partnerships. Motivated by this research gap in the literature, we study the effect of economic- and knowledge-related innovation impediments on a degree of formal openness in innovation. Analyzing a 3 years panel dataset of German manufacturing firms obtained from Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP) database, we find that knowledge-related obstacles induce firms to increase the scale of R&D outsourcing as well as to engage in innovation cooperation partnerships. Contrariwise, a non-significant relationship is detected between economic related innovation impediments and R&D openness.

Hannigan T.R., Seidel V.P., Yakis-Douglas B.;Product innovation rumors as forms of open innovation;2018;Prior studies of open innovation have highlighted the effects of different flows of knowledge between firms and external partners—such as flows of software code, technical solutions, or new product ideas—and how firms face a “paradox of openness” about how open to be to external sources while also appropriating value. There are increasingly flows of more provisional knowledge as well, in the form of product innovation rumors exchanged within online technology blogs. Our study objective was to understand how product innovation rumors are used by firms as both inflows and outflows of provisional knowledge and their effect on the innovation process. Using interview data within a high-technology firm whose forthcoming products were the subject of rumor within technology blogs, we develop propositions regarding how inflows of product innovation rumors affect innovation decisions (while addressing concerns about appropriability and intrafirm knowledge flows) and how outflows from firms may affect stakeholders outside the firm (through selective revealing and influence of technology blog editors). Product innovation rumors in part address the paradox of openness by forming an informal means of open innovation alongside formal processes, and we suggest further research opportunities in this domain. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;Prior studies of Open Innovation have highlighted the effects of different flows of knowledge between firms and external partners—such as flows of software code, technical solutions, or new product ideas—and how firms face a “paradox of openness” about how open to be to external sources while also appropriating value.

Product innovation rumors in part address the paradox of openness by forming an informal means of Open Innovation alongside formal processes, and we suggest further research opportunities in this domain. ;10.1016/j.respol.2018.02.018;2-s2.0-85043515005;Canada;"Business, Management and Accounting; Decision Sciences; Engineering";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Parida V., Westerberg M., Frishammar J.;Inbound Open Innovation Activities in High-Tech SMEs: The Impact on Innovation Performance;2012;Prior studies suggest that open innovation activities positively influence innovation outcomes in large firms. However, few studies have investigated the implications of small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) adoption of open innovation. We address this research gap by investigating the effects of four inbound open innovation activities on innovation performance of SMEs. In doing so, we draw on data from 252 high-tech SMEs. Our results reveal that different open innovation activities are beneficial for different innovation outcomes. For instance, technology sourcing is linked to radical innovation performance, whereas technology scouting is linked to incremental innovation performance. These findings hold several important theoretical and practical implications. © 2012 International Council for Small Business.;Prior studies suggest that Open Innovation activities positively influence innovation outcomes in large firms.

Roper S., Hewitt-Dundas N.;Catalysing open innovation through publicly-funded R&D: A comparison of university and company-based research centres;2013;"Public funding of university and company-based R&D centres of excellence is widespread both in core and more peripheral regions. What is less well-known is whether these R&D centres can catalyse multi-directional, multi-actor and iterative innovation. Based on data from a real-time monitoring study, this article explores the development of 18 R&D centres' external connections. University-based R&D centres establish more new connections than company-based centres and are more likely to be interacting with small or micro-firms. However, there is a general bias towards links with larger firms; micro, small and medium-sized enterprises also are less likely to be involved in collaborative R&D with research centres than other types of relationships. The results suggest the potential for R&D centres to act as a catalyst for open innovation but emphasise the need to ensure that the focus of the R&D being conducted is relevant to the needs of smaller firms. © The Author(s) 2012.";"Public funding of university and company-based R&D centres of excellence is widespread both in core and more peripheral regions.

Schillo R.S., Kinder J.S.;Delivering on societal impacts through open innovation: a framework for government laboratories;2017;Public research organizations and other government laboratories (PROs) around the world are being challenged to show how their research is contributing to public benefits and to commercialization in the private sector. At the same time, the private sector they are expected to connect with is challenged to define and further develop their business models in an increasingly open innovation environment. PROs have multi-dimensional ties with open innovation environments through their regulatory, policy, and program (e.g., research and innovation) activities. Thus, it can be expected that PROs not only affect and are affected by changes in business models among companies, but they also need to develop their own models to remain relevant and effective. As the equivalent of private sector business models, we propose six impact models for science-based government organizations. This framework provides a nuanced understanding of the contributions of PROs to open innovation environments. We illustrate its application and document a number of emerging impact models in a case study of Natural Resources Canada, a science-based department of the Canadian federal government involved in many industries and with numerous external contacts. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;Public research organizations and other government laboratories (PROs) around the world are being challenged to show how their research is contributing to public benefits and to commercialization in the private sector.

Gascó M.;Living labs: Implementing open innovation in the public sector;2017;Public sector innovation is an important issue in the agenda of policymakers and academics but there is a need for a change of perspective, one that promotes a more open model of innovating, which takes advantage of the possibilities offered by collaboration between citizens, entrepreneurs and civil society as well as of new emerging technologies. Living labs are environments that can support public open innovation processes. This article makes a practical contribution to understand the role of living labs as intermediaries of public open innovation. The analysis focuses on the dynamics of these innovation intermediaries, their outcomes, and their main challenges. In particular, it adopts a qualitative approach (fourteen semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted) in order to analyze two living labs: Citilab in the city of Cornellà and the network of fab athenaeums (public fab labs) in the city of Barcelona, both in Spain. After a thorough analysis of the attributes of these living labs, the article concludes that 1) living labs provide the opportunity for public agencies to meet with private sector organizations and thus function as innovation intermediaries, 2) implementing an open innovation perspective is considered more important than obtaining specific innovation results, and 3) scalability and sustainability are the main problems living labs encounter as open innovation intermediaries. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.;Public sector innovation is an important issue in the agenda of policymakers and academics but there is a need for a change of perspective, one that promotes a more open model of innovating, which takes advantage of the possibilities offered by collaboration between citizens, entrepreneurs and civil society as well as of new emerging technologies.

Heimstädt M., Reischauer G.;Framing innovation practices in interstitial issue fields: open innovation in the NYC administration;2019;Public sector organisations increasingly innovate through open innovation practices that originated in the private sector. To explain the use of these innovation practices, extant research has focused on enabling conditions at the individual and organisational level, but has paid little attention to extra-organisational factors such as culture. To address this gap, we adopted a field framing perspective to study the use of open innovation practices in the New York City (NYC) administration. We found that actors in NYC equipped different social positions–insider, outsider and interstitial–and used different discursive tactics–reflective frame blending and supplemental frame blending–to enhance the cultural resonance of open innovation practices. We further theorise these findings with a framework on the enabling conditions for the cultural resonance of innovation practices. Our study contributes to innovation studies by unpacking the role of culture for the use of innovation practices and to the framing literature by specifying the role of discursive tactics and social positions for the cultural resonance of new practices. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Public sector organisations increasingly innovate through Open Innovation practices that originated in the private sector.

Cheng C.C.J., Shiu E.C.;The inconvenient truth of the relationship between open innovation activities and innovation performance;2015;Purpose - Despite extensive published research into the relationship between open innovation (OI) activities and performance, the nature and direction of the relationship remain inconclusive. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship as to how firms' inbound and outbound OI activities, as well as their interaction influence incremental and radical innovation performance. The authors also consider the potentially mediating roles of knowledge learning and organizational capabilities in such a relationship. Design/methodology/approach - To investigate this relationship, data were collected from a cross-industry survey of 304 leading Taiwanese-based firms. Three-stage least square analysis was employed to test the model. Findings - Analyses reveal that knowledge learning and organizational capabilities mediate the OI activities-innovation performance relationship. In addition, a firm focussing on inbound activities enhances its radical innovation performance, but hinders its incremental innovation performance, while focussing on outbound activities produces the opposite effects. Among the findings, it is worth emphasizing that the effect of the interaction between inbound and outbound activities on innovation performance can be counter-productive. Research limitations/implications - The findings demonstrate that existing studies only partially explain the effects of OI activities on innovation performance. Understanding how OI activities influence innovation performance will facilitate more informed decision making, leading to more effective use of OI activities. Practical implications - The results suggest that managers need to consider knowledge learning and organizational capabilities in order to fully capture the potential effects of OI activities. Managers also need to be aware of the limitations of OI activities.

Naqshbandi M.M., Kaur S.;Do managerial ties support or stifle open innovation?;2014;Purpose - Research investigating the role of factors affecting open innovation remains scarce. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of managerial ties in facilitating the two types of open innovation - in-bound and out-bound. Design/methodology/approach - Data are collected using the questionnaire survey method from 339 middle and top managers working in four high-tech industries in Malaysia. Findings - Results show that in most high-tech industries in Malaysia, managerial ties with universities and with government officials facilitate in-bound open innovation, while ties with managers at other firms do not significantly relate to it in any high-tech industry. Further, managerial ties are not found to relate significantly to out-bound open innovation in any high-tech industry except in the aerospace and electronics industries wherein ties with government officials relate negatively and positively to out-bound innovation, respectively. Practical implications - This study provides empirical evidence about the managerial ties practitioners should and should not forge to succeed in the open innovation paradigm. Originality/value - This study is probably the only study so far that gauges the impact of managerial ties on open innovation. The results of this study fill a major gap in the current open innovation theory besides providing insights for practitioners. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose - Research investigating the role of factors affecting Open Innovation remains scarce.

Design/methodology/approach – After a preliminary phase concerning the context analysis, methodology includes three main steps: conceptualization of functions; preliminary design; and conceptual design of the system/SW architecture. In each of these phases, the authors tried to merge evidence from the scientific literature with empirical insight emerging from the field. Findings – Results report the conceptual design proposal for an integrated ICT platform supporting the OI.

Bugshan H.;Open innovation using Web 2.0 technologies;2015;"Purpose – The internal resources of a firm should not be regarded as the only source of innovation; organizations need to look at the external sources which can contribute greatly. This can happen through the recent development in technologies and the emergence of social media; such advancements have empowered consumers to have social interaction with their peers in online communities. As a source of generation of innovative ideas, company-based communities have not received enough attention, although they are strong drivers for co-creation of value by customers. Easy online communication channels, facilitated through online communities, have developed open innovation as an attractive means of customer involvement in value creation. However, literature in this area is devoid of empirical research on the way consumers can participate in open innovation communities using Web 2.0 technologies. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – This paper, therefore, looks at the opportunities offered by social media to firms for open innovation in the context of new product development (NPD). The study is based on social support theory and the concept of social media generating open innovation; a model for the research has thus been proposed. The model has been tested using partial least square through an online questionnaire.

Caputo M., Lamberti E., Cammarano A., Michelino F.;Exploring the impact of open innovation on firm performances;2016;Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationships between the openness of firms and their innovation and financial performances. Design/methodology/approach – In order to investigate such relationships, data on inbound and outbound open innovation (OI) processes and performances of 110 worldwide top research and development (R&D) spending bio-pharmaceutical companies are collected via the consolidated annual reports and the PATSTAT database. The time period of the analysis is 2008-2012. Findings – Regarding innovation performances, R&D productivity and revenues to patents ratio decrease with openness, whilst patents growth is not influenced by OI adoption. As to financial performances, sales growth exhibits a positive trend with openness, while operating profit and turnover decrease with OI adoption. Particularly, an inverted U-relationship with inbound and a U-shape one with outbound are observed as of operating profit. Research limitations/implications – The study adds to the knowledge about the effect of openness on firms’ performances, a topic of increasing interest to academics, managers and policy makers. Both inbound and outbound facets of the phenomenon are taken into account. Practical implications – Understanding how openness affects performances enables more informed decision making by managers, leading to a more effective use of OI activities. Originality/value – The work provides new insights as to what “being open” means for a company, gauging both inbound and outbound transactions after a pecuniary perspective. Employing objective and continuous measures, the relevance of OI for the whole business of firms can be identified. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationships between the openness of firms and their innovation and financial performances. Design/methodology/approach – In order to investigate such relationships, data on inbound and outbound Open Innovation processes and performances of 110 worldwide top research and development (R&D) spending bio-pharmaceutical companies are collected via the consolidated annual reports and the PATSTAT database. The time period of the analysis is 2008-2012. Findings – Regarding innovation performances, R&D productivity and revenues to patents ratio decrease with openness, whilst patents growth is not influenced by OI adoption. As to financial performances, sales growth exhibits a positive trend with openness, while operating profit and turnover decrease with OI adoption. Particularly, an inverted U-relationship with inbound and a U-shape one with outbound are observed as of operating profit. Research limitations/implications – The study adds to the knowledge about the effect of openness on firms’ performances, a topic of increasing interest to academics, managers and policy makers. Both inbound and outbound facets of the phenomenon are taken into account.

Villasalero M.;University knowledge, open innovation and technological capital in Spanish science parks: Research revealing or technology selling?;2014;Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the connection between university research and technological capital developed by science park (SCP) firms in order to elucidate whether the causal linkage is owing to non-pecuniary research spillovers or pecuniary technology transfer activities.Design/methodology/approach – Two publicly available surveys, one dealing with the research and transfer activities of 45 Spanish universities and another with the patenting activities of 44 Spanish SCPs, are matched in such a way that hypotheses can be tested using regression analysis.Findings – The patenting performance of SCP firms is positively related to the competitive R&D projects undertaken by the universities to which they are affiliated and negatively related to the technology transfer activities carried out by those universities. These findings suggest that the scientific knowledge produced by universities principally contributes to private technology-based firms’ technological capital through non-pecuniary research spillovers, whereas the pecuniary technology transfer agreements remain uncertain or may even prove to be detrimental.Practical implications – Firms that are considering locating or remaining in a university-affiliated SCP should be aware that the university’s pecuniary orientation when managing its intellectual capital may become a barrier as regards the firm filling its technological capital shortages. From a university administrator perspective, the complementary or substitute role of technology transfer offices vis-à -vis SCPs should be considered in the light of the selling or revealing approach adopted by the university in order to commercialize and diffuse potential inventions.Originality/value – This study contributes to existing literature by shedding light on the causal linkage between university research and firm innovation, obtaining evidence in favor of an upstream, non-pecuniary and revealing role of universities in support of the accumulation of technological capital amongst SCPs tenant firms. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the connection between university research and technological capital developed by science park (SCP) firms in order to elucidate whether the causal linkage is owing to non-pecuniary research spillovers or pecuniary technology transfer activities.Design/methodology/approach – Two publicly available surveys, one dealing with the research and transfer activities of 45 Spanish universities and another with the patenting activities of 44 Spanish SCPs, are matched in such a way that hypotheses can be tested using regression analysis.Findings – The patenting performance of SCP firms is positively related to the competitive R&D projects undertaken by the universities to which they are affiliated and negatively related to the technology transfer activities carried out by those universities.

Fertő I., Molnár A., Tóth J.;Borderless ideas – open innovation in the Hungarian food chain;2016;"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the innovation performance in the Hungarian food chain using the concept of open innovation. Design/methodology/approach – Empirical analysis is based on the data from a 2014 survey of more than 300 small- and medium-sized agricultural producers, food processors and food retailers. The authors analyse innovation performance taking into account not only the direct impacts of external knowledge inflows and absorptive capacity, but also the indirect effect of external knowledge inflows mediated by the existence of potentially complementary internal resources (absorptive capacity). The authors determine the impact of open innovation and a company’s absorptive capacity on innovation performance employing two stage approaches. First, the authors apply a semi-non parametric probit model. Second, the authors run cluster analysis to categorize companies based on their open innovation, absorptive capacity, firm and managerial characteristics. Findings – Results imply the openness along the food chain may decrease the introduction time of innovation in all areas of innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The openness towards competitors may decrease the introduction time of innovation with regard to technological innovation, but it may increase with regard to product innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The absorptive capacity decreases the introduction time of technological product, organizational and market innovation. There is a positive relationship between the use of external knowledge (when it is defined as openness with competitors) and own innovation capacity with regard to innovation propensity, but not when it is defined as openness along the food chain. The enterprises of the sample are dividing into two groups: innovative (dominated by processors) and not innovative ones (dominated by producers and retailers). Research limitations/implications – Some limitations of the paper are worth mentioning. The study is limited in its scope with regard to the research setting and the unit of analysis (Hungarian food chain). With regard to the former, our sample consists of 302 SMEs along the food chain, almost equally distributed as producers, processors and retailers. At the end of 2014 in Hungary there were 7,766 producers, 2,681 processors and 6,420 retailers in this category, which means 1.3 – 3.7 per cent coverage (Agrárgazdasági Kutatóintézet, 2014). Regarding the latter, the paper defines food chain in a narrow sense (three levels); therefore, the results represent the perspectives of a limited number of food chain partners (producers, processors, retailers). Were the definition to be widened, input from additional members would be necessary (such as suppliers of suppliers, customers of customers, third parties or competitors). Nevertheless, although the scope may be narrow, it is appropriate for our objective. Future research is recommended to overcome the paper’s limitations (i.e. extend its scope to other countries, sectors and levels of chain). Practical implications – The analysis provides valuable inputs for policy makers and SMEs along the food chain that wish to build and improve (open) innovation system. Policy makers would need more targeted innovation development programmes in order to solve the tight innovation bottlenecks. These programmes should target first of all at expanding the absorptive capacities of the food chain’s enterprises. The authors also need further research in order to investigate how much the restricted use of open innovation systems in the Hungarian food enterprises is linked to the cost and benefits of creation such systems.

Noh Y.;Financial effects of open innovation in the manufacturing industry;2015;Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the long-term financial effects of open innovation in the manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach – Drawing upon an open innovation literature, this study examined 671 open innovation announcements made by firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations during 2003-2012. By employing the event study, the long-term financial performances of the firms that announced open innovation were measured using six dependent performance variables (ROA, ROS, Tobin’s Q, Cost ratio, Sales growth, Asset turnover). Findings – The results indicate that open innovation in the manufacturing industry may lead to long-term improvements in firm profitability, triggering a positive reaction by stockholders. Open innovation also decreased production costs and increased sales volume over the long run. In all, open innovation was found to be beneficial to the firm in terms of profitability, production process improvement, and market benefits. Originality/value – This paper is the first longitudinal empirical study to investigate the long-term effects of open innovation in terms of US manufacturing financial performance. It contributes to the body of knowledge by complementing previous open innovation studies, which generally focus on context-specific issues. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the long-term financial effects of Open Innovation in the manufacturing industry.

Yoon B., Song B.;A systematic approach of partner selection for open innovation;2014;Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a systematic approach to exploring potential partners for open innovation in order to facilitate the process of technological collaboration.Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach utilizes patent information that is considered the most effective data to investigate innovation activities by applying morphology analysis (MA) and generative topology map (GTM) to the process to identify the configurations of technologies and visualize the collected patent information. In particular, diverse informative indices can assist researchers in deriving appropriate partners for technological cooperation.Findings - The hybrid approach that combines MA, GTM, and indices is useful to discover technological opportunity, identify necessary technologies and explore potential partners. The systematic process can overcome the limitations of existing approaches that depend on the insights and strategic decisions of top management, reflect a superficial relationship among firms and mostly fail to consider both theoretical and practical approaches to retrieve potential partners.Practical implications - The results of this paper will help practitioners, academic researchers, and policy makers link a pair of partners who can maximize the synergy of collaboration in a systematic manner. The proposed approach is illustrated to show the validity of the process with a case of light emitting diode (LED) technology. In addition, the social cost for collaboration can be reduced by applying the proposed approach in open innovation.Originality/value - This paper tackles the important issue of exploring appropriate partners by applying a systematic approach that utilizes text mining, MA and GTM because existing research mostly deals with ad-hoc processes. The proposed approach utilizes multiple methodologies of data mining and technology forecasting to derive promising technology areas in a systematic manner and then employs critical indices to explore proper partners. Thus, this approach considers both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to suggest a sophisticated tool for successful open innovation.

Shin S.R., Han J., Marhold K., Kang J.;Reconfiguring the firm’s core technological portfolio through open innovation: Focusing on technological M&A;2017;Purpose – The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of open innovation, especially focusing on technological M&A, on subsequent innovation and changes to the firm’s core technological portfolio. Design/methodology/approach – The study suggests three types of core technological areas, based on prior focus and experience in technological categories. These are 1) the existing core area, in which the acquirer firm retains its knowledge and expertise, 2) the enhanced core area, where knowledge and expertise in the acquirer firm’s insufficient areas are strengthened, and 3) the new core area, i.e. new knowledge fields in which the acquirer firm ventures into. The study then analyzes the effects of two key knowledge characteristics of the target firm, similarity and complementarity, on post-M&A innovation outcomes in each of the three core technological areas. Findings – The results confirm that while none of the investigated knowledge characteristics of the target firm is advantageous for post-M&A innovation outcomes in existing core areas, similarity of the target firm does facilitate post-M&A innovation outcomes in enhanced core areas. Moreover, the results confirm that complementarity of the target firm is beneficial for post-M&A innovation outcomes in new core areas. Originality/value – The study explains the reconfiguration mechanism of a firm’s core technological portfolio. It also suggests an extended framework to analyze innovation outcomes in more detail. Moreover, the study helps to explain why most M&As result in failure. © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose – The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Open Innovation, especially focusing on technological M&A, on subsequent innovation and changes to the firm’s core technological portfolio.

Design/methodology/approach – A case study of a single project is presented: a drug in-licensing decision made by a team of three managers in a large Australian pharmaceutical firm. Using participant-observation, interviews and archival analysis, the authors followed the managers as they identified and evaluated 122 late-stage anti-diabetic drug variants for further development. Findings – The managers used decision heuristics to arrive at a short list of three drugs from a choice set of 122. While the process was ostensibly rational and systematic, there was evidence of data quality issues, misleading mental models and cognitive bias. The authors concluded a high probability of accepting a poor candidate or rejecting a stronger candidate (i.e. making Type I and II errors). Research limitations/implications – This paper focuses on initial market and technology evaluation stage only (i.e. not commercialization) and is a single case study design; therefore, care should be taken in generalizing to other decisions or other contexts.

"Podmetina, D; Soderquist, KE; Petraite, M; Teplov, R";Developing a competency model for open innovation: From the individual to the organisational level;2018;Purpose From the organisational perspective, the authors know that management, including innovation management, becomes less organised by bureaucracy and administrative tools, and much more impacted by organisational capabilities, competences and hidden, soft routines, bringing innovation and creativity to the core of organisation. The purpose of this paper is to focus on competency sets for open innovation (OI) and is to provide recommendations for OI competency development in companies, linked to the core OI processes. Design/methodology/approach The research is exploratory and aims at theory-based practical indication combining deductive identification of competency clusters and inductive model development. Thus, the authors apply quantitative methods to data collection and analysis. The authors conducted an extensive literature review on competence challenges with regard to execution of OI, and empirical data analysis based on a large-scale structured industrial survey in Europe (N=264), leading to the development of competency sets for companies. SPSS tools are applied for empirical tests. Findings The authors develop a generic OI competency model applicable across industries, combined with organisational implications for sustaining OI management capabilities. The research clusters competencies based on the empirical analysis, which addresses the various challenges of OI, leading to recommendations for competency management in an OI context. Research limitations/implications The data were collected from one key informant per company. Although the authors made efforts to ensure that this was a senior manager responsible for innovation, the authors cannot exclude some bias in the way that OI activities and related competencies are perceived. Exploratory nature of the research, which calls for a more systematic investigation of the OI activity modes and the OI competencies resulting competency model. In particular, the competencies could be tested on an inter-professional sample of employees with involvement in and/or responsibility for innovation, development, and HR management, as well as on leaders of innovating companies. Third, although significant in size for the analyses undertaken, the sample is not large enough to enable a more fine-tuned analysis of regional differences across Europe in the way that OI is managed through the development and implementation of competencies. Practical implications The research contributes to the OI management field with an outlined OI competency profile that can be implemented flexibly and tailored to individual firm's needs. It brings indications for both further theory building and practice of innovation organisation, especially with regard to human resource development and organisational capability building for OI. Social implications The social implications of the paper result from the contribution to innovation management competency development in OI regimes, which is an important tool for designing contemporary educational programmes, contributes to OI management sophistication in business which is especially important during the economy slowdown and search for new sources of growth and productivity, and supports firms productive engagement in OI ecosystems and collective technology upgrading towards higher societal benefits and stakeholder involvement. Originality/value An empirically grounded OI competency model is proposed with an implication to support human resource development for OI. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no prior attempt to build such a model. The distinguished feature of the research is its extensive European coverage of 35 countries and multinational scope.

The authors conducted an extensive literature review on competence challenges with regard to execution of OI, and empirical data analysis based on a large-scale structured industrial survey in Europe (N=264), leading to the development of competency sets for companies. SPSS tools are applied for empirical tests. Findings The authors develop a generic OI competency model applicable across industries, combined with organisational implications for sustaining OI management capabilities. The research clusters competencies based on the empirical analysis, which addresses the various challenges of OI, leading to recommendations for competency management in an OI context. Research limitations/implications The data were collected from one key informant per company. Although the authors made efforts to ensure that this was a senior manager responsible for innovation, the authors cannot exclude some bias in the way that OI activities and related competencies are perceived. Exploratory nature of the research, which calls for a more systematic investigation of the OI activity modes and the OI competencies resulting competency model. In particular, the competencies could be tested on an inter-professional sample of employees with involvement in and/or responsibility for innovation, development, and HR management, as well as on leaders of innovating companies. Third, although significant in size for the analyses undertaken, the sample is not large enough to enable a more fine-tuned analysis of regional differences across Europe in the way that OI is managed through the development and implementation of competencies. Practical implications The research contributes to the OI management field with an outlined OI competency profile that can be implemented flexibly and tailored to individual firm's needs. It brings indications for both further theory building and practice of innovation organisation, especially with regard to human resource development and organisational capability building for OI. Social implications The social implications of the paper result from the contribution to innovation management competency development in OI regimes, which is an important tool for designing contemporary educational programmes, contributes to OI management sophistication in business which is especially important during the economy slowdown and search for new sources of growth and productivity, and supports firms productive engagement in OI ecosystems and collective technology upgrading towards higher societal benefits and stakeholder involvement. Originality/value An empirically grounded OI competency model is proposed with an implication to support human resource development for OI. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no prior attempt to build such a model. The distinguished feature of the research is its extensive European coverage of 35 countries and multinational scope. The empirical validation strategy makes the research extremely relevant for management decisions related to human factors related OI capability development in organisations.;10.1108/MD-04-2017-0445;WOS:000434254200009;ENGLAND;"Business, Management and Accounting; Decision Sciences";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
"Biscotti, AM; Mafrolla, E; Del Giudice, M; D'Amico, E";CEO turnover and the new leader propensity to open innovation: Agency-resource dependence view and social identity perspective;2018;Purpose In an increasingly turbulent and competitive environment, open innovation could be critical for a firm's success, favoring organizational flexibility and accelerating innovation processes. However, sharing innovation projects with external partners often requires changes in traditional organizational behavior and visions of CEOs. The purpose of this paper is to theorize and empirically verify how the CEO turnover and some socially relevant characteristics of the old and the new CEO may impact firms' propensity toward open innovation under an integrated agency-resource dependence view and social identity perspective. Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis was carried out on 264 companies drawn from 16 developed European markets included in the S&P Europe 350 Dow Jones index over the years 2006-2015. To test the predictions, the authors adopted regression analysis by employing the panel two-stages least squares model and the ordinary least squares econometric model. Findings Consistently with the predictions, the authors found that CEO turnover stimulates open innovation. Particularly, the results suggest that the organizational identity rationale may motivate a divergent propensity between insider and outsider new CEOs, with outsiders more prone to open innovation. The higher tendency of new outsider CEOs to undertake innovation projects jointly with external organizations prevails also within firms that experienced a long tenure of the former CEO, thereby suggesting that a new outsider CEO appears able to renovate corporate strategic directions also in highly orthodox organizational cultures. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that theorizes why CEO turnover might impact the propensity of the firm toward open innovation. The authors use an integrated agency-resource dependence perspective, and the results from the empirical analysis mostly support the predictions. Moreover, the authors adopt the social identity theory to show that the organizational identification of the CEO matters in the decision of engaging in open innovation.;Purpose In an increasingly turbulent and competitive environment, Open Innovation could be critical for a firm's success, favoring organizational flexibility and accelerating innovation processes.

Their role in value creation through collaboration and the inter-firm differences is yet to be explored in depth. Design/methodology/approach To achieve the aim, survey data is analyzed to rank OI practices (collaboration) of the firms, while patent data are analyzed to carry out descriptive and bivariate analysis to study the inter-firm differences in collaboration. Findings The survey findings highlight mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and patent pooling as the top two preferred modes of OI, while from patent data M&A has emerged as a predominant OI practice for mainly nonresident firms. At the firm level characteristics, out of firm age, number of granted patents and firm size, firm age has been found to be somewhat significant in few cases of OI practices.

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design. This research is based on an empirical analysis undertaken with 65 listed companies in order to examine, in the first phase, the Dividend Champions. These firms have increased their dividend yield for at least the past 40 years. In a second phase, this research studies the application of an open innovation practice for those listed companies that have systematically paid increased dividends for 60 years and have, at the same time, beat the market. Findings This study reveals seven listed companies that, for more than 60 years, have regularly paid growing dividends and, at the same time, have beat the yield of the market (i.e. six out of the seven companies).

Madoff Investment Securities fraud case, introduces and elaborates upon the concept of dark open innovation. The paper's conceptual framework is drawn from social capital theory, which is grounded on the socio-economics of Bourdieu, Coleman and Putnam and is employed in order to make sense of the processes that occur within dark open innovation. Design/methodology/approach Given the self-evident access issues, this paper is necessarily based on archival and secondary sources taken from the court records of Madoff v. New York - including victim impact statements, the defendant's Plea Allocution, and academic and journalistic commentaries - which enable the identification of the processes involved in dark open innovation. Significantly, this paper also represents an important inter-disciplinary collaboration between academic scholars variously informed by business and history subject domains. Findings Although almost invariably cast as a positive process, innovation can also be evidenced as a negative or dark force. This is particularly relevant in open innovation contexts, which often call for the creation of extended trust and close relationships. This paper outlines a case of dark open innovation. Research limitations/implications A key implication of this study is that organizational innovation is not automatically synonymous with human flourishing or progress. This paper challenges the automatic assumption of innovation being positive and introduces the notion of dark open innovation. Although this is accomplished by means of an in-depth single case, the findings have the potential to resonate in a wide spectrum of situations. Practical implications Innovation is a concept that applies across a range of organization and management domains. Criminals also innovate; thus, the paper provides valuable insights into the organizational innovation processes especially involved in relation to dark open innovation contexts. Social implications It is important to develop and fully understand the possible wider meanings of innovation and also to recognize that innovation - particularly dark open innovation - does not always create progress.

In certain circumstances, open innovation entails a radical change of policy that involves various different functions of a company such as R&D, production, and management over a period of years and gives rise to mechanisms of mutual interaction with several business partners, such as collaboration with other companies, universities and R&D institutions, and new suppliers. Then, the question arises of how to measure the impact of such complex open innovation processes on the overall performances of companies. Design/methodology/approach A holistic case study is applied to analyze the effect of open innovation projects on a corporate company's stock price dynamics. The scope is to identify two different scenarios pre- and post-adoption of an open innovation model by a multinational company, Fujifilm. In particular, a stochastic model, namely the log-normal model, is applied along with three statistical tests: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer von Mises, and F-test for equal variances, in order to verify if the adoption of an open innovation model causes any significant change in the stock price dynamics of the corporate company. Findings From the findings emerges evidence that open innovation projects have a moderate effect on Fujifilm's stock price dynamics, but a greater improvement of the perception of Fujifilm's stock value.

Findings The findings confirm that Open Innovation fosters patenting activity in health care, also thanks to huge governments' expenditures in this market. Research limitations/implications The study focuses solely on European firms and it adopts a traditional linear approach. So, we cannot exclude that different dynamics may occur across European borders. Future research should address this concern by focusing on multi-country comparative studies. Practical implications Open Innovation is the most suitable model for health industry, because it improves both innovation performance and intellectual capital of firms. Originality/value The study tackles an existing gap of the literature by considering how the presence of large customers impacts the strength of intellectual property protection.;10.1108/JIC-03-2020-0076;WOS:000570563000001;ENGLAND;"Business, Management and Accounting; Social Sciences";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Feller J., Hayes J., O'Reilly P., Finnegan P.;Institutionalising information asymmetry: governance structures for open innovation;2009;"Purpose This paper aims to explore the ways in which firms utilise hierarchical relationships and the market system to supply and acquire intellectual property (IP) and/or innovation capabilities from sources external to the firm. Design/methodology/approach The authors conduct a field study to explore emerging governance structures for open innovation, using multiple data sources including documents (e.g. white papers) and interviews published by the firms studied, analysis of the firms' web-based systems (where applicable), secondary content (e.g. news articles) and elite interviews with key personnel. Findings The analysis of seven exemplars of open innovation reveals that inter-organisational relationships that facilitate open innovation can be categorised based on whether they are mediated or direct, and seek to exchange intellectual property or innovation capability. Using this categorisation, the authors present an analysis that reveals four governance structures along ten dimensions, and discuss the influence of knowledge dispersion, uncertainty and transaction costs on the emergence of such structures. The authors conclude that the appropriateness of hierarchical/market relationships or intermediaries to source IP and/or innovation capability is dependent on the information asymmetry in relation to the existence and availability of potential solutions/solvers; the suitability of potential innovation partners (solution providers and solvers); and the acquisition process for external innovations (including problem specification, solution evaluation, transfer, etc.). Research limitations/implications The research is exploratory in nature, and designed to serve as a foundation for future research efforts. In particular, the work highlights the need for research that takes an inter-organisational perspective on facilitating open innovation. Practical implications The research highlights the prominence of information asymmetry as a key issue in choosing and designing appropriate governance structures for open innovation.

"Matricano, D; Candelo, E; Sorrentino, M; Cappiello, G";Investigating the link between intellectual capital and open innovation processes: a longitudinal case study;2020;Purpose This paper investigates the link between Intellectual Capital (IC) and Open Innovation (OI). Scholars worldwide consider the topics as standing alone and so they give scarce attention to the possible link between them. Managerial experiences (and few theoretical contributions), instead, hypothesize a significant role that IC can play over OI processes in order make them successful. Design/methodology/approach The methodology of a single case study is used to investigate the link between IC and OI. In particular, an OI process managed by a global company, LEGO, and named Mindstorms is rebuilt and analysed herein. Findings Intermediate results achieved by LEGO through its OI process were unsuccessful since the company had not developed its own IC (made up of relational, human and structural capital). The subsequent development of IC, instead, has driven to successful results. This suggests that if companies do not develop their IC before launching OI processes, then these processes might be not successful. Research limitations/implications One limitation is the use of a single case study. Despite this, the present article is a warning for all the companies: before launching OI processes they need to develop their IC. Originality/value To the best knowledge of the authors, this is one of the first works that deepens the investigation of the link between IC and OI. Very often, scholars investigating IC shyly refer to OI, without mentioning it, while the scholars investigating OI allude to IC, without citing it.

Specifically, it considers the relationships between sourcing knowledge from an external environment, transferring knowledge to an external environment and adopting solutions that are useful to appropriate returns from innovation. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzes the connection between the number of patent applications and the amount of OI, as well as the association between the number of patent applications and the use of BDA. Data from firms in the 27 European Union countries were retrieved from the Eurostat database for the period 2014-2019 and were investigated using an ordinary least squares regression analysis. Findings Because of its twofold lens based on both knowledge management and OI, this study sheds light on OI collaboration modes and highlights the crucial role they could play in innovation. In particular, the results suggest that OI collaboration modes have a strong effect on innovation performance, stimulating the search for RKE. Originality/value This study furthers a deeper understanding of RKE, which is shown to be an important mechanism that incentivizes firms to increase their efforts in the innovation process. Further, RKE supports firms in taking full advantage of the innovative knowledge they generate within their inter-organizational network.;Purpose This study aims to investigate the effects of Open Innovation and big data analytics (BDA) on reflective knowledge exchange (RKE) within the context of complex collaborative networks.

Bican P.M., Guderian C.C., Ringbeck A.;Managing knowledge in open innovation processes: an intellectual property perspective;2017;Purpose: As firms turn their innovation activities toward collaborating with external partners, they face additional challenges in managing their knowledge. While different modes of intellectual property right regimes are applied in closed innovation systems, there seems to be tension between the concepts of “open innovation” and “intellectual property rights”. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how firms best manage knowledge via intellectual property rights in open innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach: Following a mixed methods approach, the authors review relevant literature at the intersection of knowledge management, intellectual property rights, strategic management of intellectual property rights and the open innovation process. The authors identify success drivers through the lenses of – but not limited to – intellectual property rights and classify them in five distinct groups. Expending the view on open innovation beyond its modus operandi, the authors develop the Open Innovation Life Cycle, covering three stages and three levels of the open innovation process. The authors apply their findings to a case study in the pharmaceutical industry. Findings: The authors provide four key contributions. First, existing literature yields inconclusive results concerning the enabling or disabling function of intellectual property rights in open innovation processes, but the majority of scholars detect an ambivalent relation. Second, they identify and classify success drivers of successful knowledge management via intellectual property rights in open innovation processes. Third, they advance literature on open innovation beyond its modus operandi to include three stages and three levels. Fourth, they test their findings to a case study and show how management leverages knowledge by properly using intellectual property rights in open innovation. Practical implications: The findings support firms in managing knowledge via intellectual property rights in open innovation processes. Management should account for the peculiarities of open innovation preparation and open innovation termination to prevent unintentional knowledge drain. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to view open innovation as a process beyond its modus operandi by considering the preparations for and termination of open innovation activities.

Abdulkader B., Magni D., Cillo V., Papa A., Micera R.;Aligning firm's value system and open innovation: a new framework of business process management beyond the business model innovation;2020;Purpose: Business process management (BPM) supports the creation and capture of firm value. In a dynamic context, the current approach to BPM appears to be limited and static in the face of the challenges posed by the firm's open innovation (OI) ecosystem. The main purpose of this paper is to shed light on the value co-creation through the integration of OI principles and mechanisms of value system. Design/methodology/approach: To this aim, the paper suggested a conceptual integration of strategy and operations literature on OI and the firm's value creation system. This analysis adopted BPM lenses with specific attention to the alignment between value creation and value capture. Applying BPM lenses to the process of creating shared value sought the attainment of a comprehensive system of decisions articulated between strategy and operations. Findings: The paper pinpoints key links between strategy models and operational planning, thus proposing a new framework that integrates the characteristics of value system and OI. The paper elaborates a new theoretical framework rooted in the extant literature conducted in BPM, business strategy and business model innovation (BMI) fields. Originality/value: This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature in which strategy models are separately treated from the operational ones. This conceptual effort contributes to the extant literature by drawing upon a comprehensive frameworkand mapping the complex set of interactions between the firm's value chain and its innovation ecosystem. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: Business process management (BPM) supports the creation and capture of firm value.

Nevertheless, studies have recently started to demonstrate that different organizational factors mediate this relation under the controvertible assumption that companies are capable of responding quickly to market changes using their IT in combination with other internal resources. Therefore, companies have given very little attention to collaborative work with external partners. The purpose of this study is to analyze the mediating effects of the acquisition and exploitation capabilities of open innovation on the information technology capabilities – organizational agility relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model with survey data from a multinational corporation that operates in South American emerging economies in the pension and savings businesses. Findings: This study found that only the open innovation capability of exploitation has a partial mediating effect. This means that this organizational ability serves as a bridge so that IT capabilities can have a positive incidence on organizational agility. Originality/value: This paper adopts a more novel study focus that emphasizes the importance of collaborative work and of the use of external resources that are implicit in open innovation capability. On the other hand, this organizational ability implies external embeddedness, which is usually approached mainly from the network theory in the international business literature; however, this study offers a more interesting study focus in which externally oriented organizational abilities such as open innovation are more important for external embeddedness than are the size and quality of the external network. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Purpose: Currently, it is commonly accepted that information technology capabilities (ITC) positively influence organizational agility.

Secundo G., Toma A., Schiuma G., Passiante G.;Knowledge transfer in open innovation: A classification framework for healthcare ecosystems;2019;"Purpose: Despite the abundance of research in open innovation, few contributions explore it at inter-organizational level, and particularly with a focus on healthcare ecosystem, characterized by a dense network of relationships among public and private organizations (hospitals, companies and universities) as well as other actors that can be labeled as “untraditional” player, i.e. doctors, nurses and patients. The purpose of this paper is to cover this gap and explore how knowledge is transferred and flows among all the healthcare ecosystems’ players in order to support open innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is conceptual in nature and adopts a narrative literature review approach. In particular, insights gathered from open innovation literature at the inter-organizational network level, with a particular attention to healthcare ecosystems, and from the knowledge transfer processes, are analyzed in order to propose an interpretative framework for the understanding of knowledge transfer in open innovation with a focus on healthcare ecosystem. Findings: The paper proposes an original interpretative framework for knowledge transfer to support open innovation in healthcare ecosystems, composed of four main components: healthcare ecosystem’s players’ categories; knowledge flows among different categories of players along the exploration and exploitation stages of innovation development; players’ motivations for open innovation; and players’ positions in the innovation process. In addition, assuming the intermediary network as the suitable organizational model for healthcare ecosystem, four classification scenarios are identified on the basis of the main players’ influence degree and motivations for open innovation. Practical implications: The paper offers interpretative lenses for managers and policy makers in understanding the most suitable organizational models able to encourage open innovation in healthcare ecosystems, taking into consideration the players’ motivation and the knowledge transfer processes on the basis of the innovation results.

Cheng C.C.J., Shiu E.C.;Leveraging open innovation strategies for fueling eco-innovation performance in dynamic environments;2020;Purpose: Despite the rising interest in eco-innovation, few studies have examined how open innovation (OI) actually increases eco-innovation performance. Drawing on capabilities theory, this study aims to investigate how two specific organizational capabilities (alliance management capability and absorptive capacity) individually complement OI strategies (inbound and outbound) to increase eco-innovation performance, while taking into consideration high and low levels of environmental uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach: To test the hypotheses, the authors used a primary survey and secondary proxy data sources from 232 Taiwan-based manufacturing firms. The authors collected survey data for measuring OI strategies, followed by secondary proxy data for measuring alliance management capability, absorptive capacity, environmental uncertainty and eco-innovation performance. Findings: The results indicate that in highly dynamic environments, alliance management capability complements inbound/outbound strategies to increase eco-innovation performance. However, absorptive capacity complements only inbound strategies, not outbound strategies. Practical implications: These findings have important implications for managers attempting to increase eco-innovation performance by using OI in dynamic environments. Social implications: The findings provide new evidence that configurations of OI alone are not enough for increasing eco-innovation performance. Instead, firms’ eco-innovation benefits more when OI are complemented by alliance management capability. Originality/value: This study makes an original contribution to the eco-innovation literature by demonstrating how organizational capabilities complement OI to increase eco-innovation performance in dynamic environments. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: Despite the rising interest in eco-innovation, few studies have examined how Open Innovation actually increases eco-innovation performance.

Röd I.;TMT diversity and innovation ambidexterity in family firms: The mediating role of open innovation breadth;2019;Purpose: Family firms that simultaneously engage in multiple levels of innovation – incremental and radical – are likely to enjoy performance advantages across generations. The purpose of this paper is to research under which management conditions (i.e. top management team (TMT) diversity in terms of generational or non-family involvement) family firms are more likely to achieve innovation ambidexterity. Also, the paper addresses the mediating role of open innovation (OI) breadth in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A large cross-sectional sample of 335 small- and medium-sized family firms is used. The hypotheses were tested in a mediation model. The relationship between TMT diversity and ambidexterity is measured using a binominal regression analysis, the one between TMT diversity and OI breadth using a Tobit model. Findings: Drawing on the family firm upper echelon perspective, the results indicate that TMT diversity induced through external managers and multiple generations is positively related to innovation ambidexterity. As the mediation analysis reveals, the relationship can be explained by the higher propensity of diverse TMTs to get involved in OI breadth. The findings add to the discussion on family firm heterogeneity and its influence on different kinds of innovation. Originality/value: So far, few studies have been concerned with ambidextrous family firms. Contrary to their reputation, this study identifies family firms as radical as well as open innovators. As such, this research takes account not only of the heterogeneity of family firms, but also of the heterogeneity of family firm innovation. © 2019, Irina Röd.;Purpose: Family firms that simultaneously engage in multiple levels of innovation – incremental and radical – are likely to enjoy performance advantages across generations. The purpose of this paper is to research under which management conditions (i.e. top management team (TMT) diversity in terms of generational or non-family involvement) family firms are more likely to achieve innovation ambidexterity. Also, the paper addresses the mediating role of Open Innovation breadth in this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A large cross-sectional sample of 335 small- and medium-sized family firms is used. The hypotheses were tested in a mediation model. The relationship between TMT diversity and ambidexterity is measured using a binominal regression analysis, the one between TMT diversity and OI breadth using a Tobit model. Findings: Drawing on the family firm upper echelon perspective, the results indicate that TMT diversity induced through external managers and multiple generations is positively related to innovation ambidexterity. As the mediation analysis reveals, the relationship can be explained by the higher propensity of diverse TMTs to get involved in OI breadth. The findings add to the discussion on family firm heterogeneity and its influence on different kinds of innovation.

Hosseini S., Kees A., Manderscheid J., Röglinger M., Rosemann M.;What does it take to implement open innovation? Towards an integrated capability framework;2017;Purpose: In a world of ever-changing corporate environments and reduced product life cycles, most organizations cannot afford anymore to innovate on their own. Hence, they open their innovation processes to incorporate knowledge of external sources and to increase their innovation potential. As the shift toward open innovation (OI) is difficult and makes many initiatives fail, the question arises which capabilities organizations should develop to successfully implement OI. As the literature encompasses mature but isolated streams on OI capabilities, there is a need for an integrated capability framework. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes the open innovation capability framework (OICF) that compiles and structures capabilities relevant for implementing OI. The OICF covers the outside-in and coupled processes of OI. To integrate multiple streams of the OI literature, the OICF builds on a structured literature review. The OICF was also validated in a two-step review process with OI experts from academia and industry. Findings: The OICF comprises 23 capability areas grouped along the factors such as strategic alignment, governance, methods, information technology, people, and culture. To analyze the existing body of knowledge on OI capabilities, the authors compare the OICF with other OI-related capability frameworks and compile a heatmap based on the results of the literature review. The authors also discuss the experts’ feedback on individual factors of the OICF as well as on interdependencies among these factors. Practical implications: The OICF provides practitioners with a structured overview of the capabilities to consider when implementing OI. Based on the OICF, practitioners can define the scope of their OI initiatives. They can use the OICF as a foundation for prioritizing, selecting, and operationalizing capability areas as well as for deriving implementation roadmaps. Originality/value: The OICF is the first framework to take a holistic perspective on OI capabilities. It integrates mature but isolated research streams of OI. It helps practitioners define the scope of OI initiatives and academics gain insights into the current state of the art on OI capabilities. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: In a world of ever-changing corporate environments and reduced product life cycles, most organizations cannot afford anymore to innovate on their own.

Wu S.-M., Ding X.-H.;Unpacking the relationship between external IT capability and open innovation performance: evidence from China;2020;Purpose: Information technology plays a critical role in the open innovation process. The purpose of this study is to explore the inner mechanism of external information technology (IT) capability that affects open innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, responses to 232 questionnaires from different firms were collected in China. Then, the proposed hypotheses were tested using regression analysis by statistical product and service solutions (SPSS). Findings: The results indicate that external knowledge integration plays a mediating role in the relationship between external IT capability and open innovation performance, openness breadth positively moderates the influence of external IT capability on external knowledge integration and openness depth negatively moderates the relationship between external IT capability and external knowledge integration. Practical implications: The results, which are based on Chinese responses, provide useful suggestions for firms in China. To use external IT capability to improve open innovation performance, firms should not only stress the role of external knowledge integration but also consider their search strategy. Originality/value: Both researchers and practitioners are interested in the relationship between information technology and open innovation. However, the way in which the inner mechanism of external IT capability affects open innovation performance has not been thoroughly researched. Based on knowledge integration theory, the authors construct a model that includes external IT capability, external knowledge integration, search strategy and open innovation performance. The results of this paper confirm the mediating and moderating roles of external knowledge integration and search strategy, respectively. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: Information technology plays a critical role in the Open Innovation process.

Tranekjer T.L.;Open innovation: effects from external knowledge sources on abandoned innovation projects;2017;"Purpose: Innovation projects are often risky and costly. But not all innovation projects lead to commercialisation; some are abandoned, and these abandoned innovation projects can be classified as a waste of resources. Therefore, this paper studies the influence of different external sources and a firm’s decision to abandon an innovation project. The purpose of this paper is to provide a broader understanding of abandoned projects. Design/methodology/approach: The data applied are quantitative data and the empirical background is the Danish Innovation Survey 2009. The sample consists of Danish manufacturing firms with ten employees or more (n=840). The results are based on logistic regression analysis. Findings: Results reveal that firms should consider that the involvement of customers can lead them to abandon innovation projects. However, if firms combine customers with universities, it will decrease the likelihood of innovation projects being abandoned. A more in-depth analysis shows that the involvement of customers from “Europe” (countries in Europe excluding Denmark) and the “US” leads to innovation projects being abandoned while customers from “other countries” (the rest of the world, including China and India) have the opposite effect. Originality/value: The contribution is to the limited literature on abandoned innovation projects by suggesting that the type of external sources is a significant factor in firms’ decisions to abandon innovation projects. The paper identifies that the involvement of certain external sources leads firms to decide to abandon innovation projects, and that the country of origin of the external sources is an important criterion to consider in relation to a firm’s decision to abandon innovation projects. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Purpose: Innovation projects are often risky and costly.

Wu I.-L., Hu Y.-P.;Open innovation based knowledge management implementation: a mediating role of knowledge management design;2018;Purpose: Knowledge-based organizations is a new paradigm for business. Knowledge management (KM) is important for supporting core business processes. This paper aims to define an open innovation (OI)-driven KM implementation for effectively executing the support. Design/methodology/approach: KM is important for supporting organizational innovation. OI plays a critical determinant role in defining the design of KM for effectively supporting OI. Further, the final goal of KM is to reach the success of OI-based KM implementation. A model is thus proposed for connecting OI as a driver to a design of KM and, in turn, KM implementation. Survey is conducted to collect data. Partial least squares is used for analysis. Findings: The three processes of OI partially present significant impact on the design of KM process and, in turn, a noticeable achievement of KM implementation. The two KM processes indicate an interaction effect for reinforcement mutually. The findings provide rich evidence into the argument that OI-based KM implementation through the mediator of the design of KM process is important for a successful KM in organizations. Practical/implications: While OI is a phenomenon that has increasingly become critical for the contemporary business, the design of KM mechanism needs to be adapted from the choice of OI process for guaranteeing the success of KM implementation. Originality/value: Extant theories did not provide such an approach to develop an effective KM implementation in terms of the important management concept, OI, in organizations. This model empirically demonstrates its capability to work on this issue. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: Knowledge-based organizations is a new paradigm for business.

Crespin-Mazet F., Goglio-Primard K., Scheid F.;Open innovation processes within clusters - the role of tertius iugens;2013;Purpose: Little research focuses on the conditions under which companies open up to co-develop knowledge with external actors. Spatial proximity has been proved insufficient to generate successful open innovation processes: socio-economic proximity also seems required. This paper aims at better understanding how this new form of proximity can be organized and investigates the role of third parties or tertius iungens in this process. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on an exploratory case of successful open innovation between a software editor and a systems integrator located in the same cluster, relying on 50 face-to-face in-depth interviews, documentation and analysis of physical artifacts. Findings: It confirms that socio-economic and in particular coordination proximity favors open innovation processes. This proximity is facilitated by a third party acting as a sustained iungens to initiate contact between development partners and key customers, and to practically organize knowledge transfer. The paper suggests that to be effective this tertius iungens needs to occupy a central position in the local network and to exhibit the characteristics of an epistemic community. Research limitations/implications: Due to its exploratory design, the authors' research exhibits several limitations in terms of generalization. It does not fully appreciate the specific interaction between the various dimensions of proximity and in what respect spatial proximity positively influences or reinforces the development of socioeconomic proximity. Further research is needed to analyze the relationships between these various forms of proximity and understand whether spatial proximity is required in a context where new information technologies ease up relationship and coordination mechanisms. Another limitation is linked to the character of the open innovation project analyzed which focused on an innovation of exploitation. Practical implications: This paper suggests that territorial engineering should favor the emergence of organizations playing the role of tertius iungens in the local network. Such organizations need to have the technical expertise and image of benevolence and integrity to manage knowledge transfer. Originality/value: Little research analyzes the role of third parties or tertius iungens in the emergence and management of open innovation processes. The literature on clusters has mostly highlighted that inter-organizational cooperation emerges from spatial proximity and can be organized by public authorities whereas most of the open innovation literature on software describes cooperation patterns that do not require any third party. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose: Little research focuses on the conditions under which companies open up to co-develop knowledge with external actors.

However, their contribution to health innovation is poorly recognized and often invisible. The aim of this study was to determine the profile of innovative ideas recorded by nurses in the Innòbics ideas bank, a corporate virtual community of open innovation. Design and Methods: We used a cross-sectional study design. We identified all the innovative ideas recorded in Innòbics from June 8, 2016, to July 6, 2018. To be eligible, the ideas had to be recorded by nurses. Each innovative idea recorded was assessed by the Certification Evaluation Committee of Innòbics. After collective discussion during the evaluation sessions, each committee member independently scored the idea. The screening decision was based on the overall average score. The following variables were collected from each innovative idea that was recorded: (a) level of health care where the idea originated (primary care or secondary care), (b) subject or category according to the classification of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Health Care Innovations Exchange, (c) ratings relative to each screening criteria, and (d) the result of the screening decision: stored = ideas that were poorly developed and in which it was not possible to identify their potential for innovation; susceptible of improvement = potential ideas that needed to be improved and whose authors received comments from the evaluation committee; validated = ideas that continued the process to become innovation projects; forwarded = ideas that were not innovative but they were a complaint or a proposal for quality improvement (these were forwarded to the institutional department concerned). Findings: A total of 246 innovative ideas were recorded in the period of the study, 61 (24.8%) of which were recorded by nurses. The subjects and categories of these ideas were diverse, highlighting aspects such as patient-centered care, quality improvement strategies, preventive and chronic care, and primary care. Thirty-five (57.4%) of these innovative ideas were stored, 13 (21.3%) were susceptible to improvement, 11 (18.0%) were forwarded, and 2 (3.3%) were validated. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that approximately a quarter of the ideas were recorded by nurses. Subjects and categories of these ideas were diverse, some of them closely related to the profession and nursing practice. Two ideas were identified as potential innovation projects. Innòbics can act as an organizational tool that promotes a climate for innovation in health care. Clinical Relevance: This study recognizes nurses’ contribution to a healthcare innovation initiative and their interest in sharing innovative ideas. Its findings provide useful insights into a virtual community of open innovation such as an organizational tool for encouraging creativity and innovation in healthcare.

Lee H., Choi K., Yoo D., Suh Y., Lee S., He G.;Recommending valuable ideas in an open innovation community: A text mining approach to information overload problem;2018;Purpose: Open innovation communities are a growing trend across diverse industries because they provide opportunities of collaborating with customers and exploiting their knowledge effectively. Although open innovation communities can be strategic assets that can help firms innovate, firms nonetheless face the challenge of information overload incurred due to the characteristic of the community. The purpose of this paper is to mitigate the problem of information overload in an open innovation environment. Design/methodology/approach: This study chose MyStarbucksIdea.com (MSI) as a target open innovation community in which customers share their ideas. The authors analyzed a large data set collected from MSI utilizing text mining techniques including TF-IDF and sentiment analysis, while considering both term and non-term features of the data set. Those features were used to develop classification models to calculate the adoption probability of each idea. Findings: The results showed that term and non-term features play important roles in predicting the adoptability of ideas and the best classification accuracy was achieved by the hybrid classification models. In most cases, the precisions of classification models decreased as the number of recommendations increased, while the models’ recalls and F1s increased. Originality/value: This research dealt with the problem of information overload in an open innovation context. A large amount of customer opinions from an innovation community were examined and a recommendation system to mitigate the problem was proposed. Using the proposed system, the firm can get recommendations for ideas that could be valuable for its business innovation in the idea generation phase, thereby resolving the information overload and enhancing the effectiveness of open innovation. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: Open Innovation communities are a growing trend across diverse industries because they provide opportunities of collaborating with customers and exploiting their knowledge effectively.

Ratten V.;The effect of cybercrime on open innovation policies in technology firms;2019;Purpose: Open innovation is important for technology firms as they can use freely available resources to source creative and innovative ideas. Despite the usefulness of open innovation for technological advancements, few studies have focused on the role of cybercrime in affecting an organizations strategic direction. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of open innovation on cybercrime in technology firms. Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted on technology firms to understand the role of open innovation in terms of technology scouting, horizontal collaboration and vertical collaboration on cybercrime activity. Findings: The study found that there is a dilemma most technology firm’s face in having an open innovation strategy and how to manage cybercrime. This means that a coopetition strategy is utilized that helps to not only balance the need to have open innovation but also protect intellectual property. Research limitations/implications: The study has implications for emerging technology innovations that not only need to have cyber security but also harness the use of Big Data. Practical implications: Managers of technology firms need to encourage open innovation as a strategy but manage the cybercrime that comes from sharing too much information in an online context.

Bellantuono N., Pontrandolfo P., Scozzi B.;Different practices for open innovation: A context-based approach;2013;Purpose: The authors aim to investigate the concept of open innovation, identify different open innovation practices which help describe the continuum between closed and open innovation, and propose a framework that suggests an association between innovation contexts and practices. Design/methodology/approach: The authors first identify the variables to describe innovation contexts and practices.

A few case examples drawn from the literature prove coherent with the theoretical framework underlying the proposed association. Practical implications: The authors' results (and specifically the framework) enhance the organizations' awareness of the open innovation concept and the possible practices to implement it, as well as supporting managers to better select open innovation practices in different contexts. Originality/value: This paper discusses the concept of open innovation practices to enhance the comprehension of the open innovation concept.

Also, to the authors' knowledge, the proposed association between context and practices is original in that there are no similar theoretical frameworks that help organizations selecting innovation practices. ;10.1108/JKM-03-2013-0180;2-s2.0-84880179119;Italy;Business, Management and Accounting;Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Hsieh C.-T., Huang H.-C., Lee W.-L.;Using transaction cost economics to explain open innovation in start-ups;2016;Purpose: The basic concept of transaction cost theory is that firms like to conduct transactions in a channel with lower transaction costs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to use the transaction cost perspective to identify which conditions cause companies to choose between outbound open innovation (hierarchy governance) and inbound open innovation (market governance). Design/methodology/approach: Accordingly, transaction cost economics was used to relate the choice and implementation of open innovation using a sample of 250 electronics and information start-ups in China. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate measurement model, while logistic regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings: As expected, the dedicated asset specificity, human asset specificity, behavioral uncertainty, transaction frequency, and small number exchange were positively associated with outbound open innovation. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper lies in explaining the role played by transaction cost economics in the process of open innovation for start-ups through empirical analysis. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The basic concept of transaction cost theory is that firms like to conduct transactions in a channel with lower transaction costs.

García-Muiña F.E., Fuentes-Moraleda L., Vacas-Guerrero T., Rienda-Gómez J.J.;Understanding open innovation in small and medium-sized museums and exhibition halls: An analysis model;2019;Purpose: The hostile environments in which museums operate force them to be innovative. Most of them have fewer resources and are publicly owned. Because these factors may hinder their innovative potential, this paper aims to propose an open innovation model adapted to this type of organization to improve visitors’ experience. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative method based on a thematic analysis is carried out. Data sources are: (i) focus group with stakeholders from the destination and (ii) in-depth interviews with museums experts. Findings: This new framework is important because it brings something new to a field that previous research had barely considered. The study of the implementation of open innovation in publicly owned small and medium-sized museums brings to light the growing importance of the relational, organizational, technological and experiential dimensions, their interactions and their main constituent factors. Research limitations/implications: The study is limited to a specific type of institution, and results should not be extrapolated to other contexts. The construct of open innovation is highly complex, and that advises future research to include other players. Quantitative methods and longitudinal techniques will contribute to tackling new challenges in future research works. Practical implications: Results are helpful for museum managers and policymakers. Stakeholders improve their comprehension of how an open innovation model works because the paper offers a few guidelines for its active designing. A solid networking based on trust and the emphasis on improving the visitor experience determine making-decision processes. Originality/value: The paper provides a systemic innovation management model for museums, where there is almost no previous research. It is theoretically supported in the open innovation paradigm, as well as the absorptive capacity framework. The emerging and central role of the experiential dimension constitutes another notable contribution to literature. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The hostile environments in which museums operate force them to be innovative.

Huang S., Chen J., Liang L.;How open innovation performance responds to partner heterogeneity in China;2018;Purpose: The link between openness and innovative performance has been established as an inverted U-shape relationship, namely, the openness-performance connection is not always positive. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of partner heterogeneity to characterize the influence of “quality” changes in partners on innovative performance, that is, the focus of this paper. Given that partner heterogeneity is crucial in explaining open innovative performance, it is also worth placing the examination of this key construct in emerging regions such as China. Design/methodology/approach: The sample selection of this study covers a wide range of industries, but requires that the sample firms be manufacturing enterprises with an open innovation strategy. With opportunities and challenges associated with partner collaboration toward open innovation, the Chinese province of Zhejiang has established its reputation. Thus, empirical data were collected randomly from data pool of Zhejiang Province Economic and Information Commission, as well as a survey questionnaire. Data were using a cross-sectional survey methodology encompassing diverse organizations, industries, and nations. Findings: Empirical testing of this assumption in a sample of 217 manufacturing firms indicates that partner heterogeneities, which are classified as organizational heterogeneity, industry heterogeneity, and national heterogeneity are all positively associated with innovative performance, but the strength of this association is influenced by environmental turbulence. Technological turbulence significantly and positively modulates the relationships of organizational and national heterogeneities with innovative performance. Market turbulence also plays a significant positive role on the relationship between national heterogeneity and innovative performance, while technological and market turbulence roles on the relationship between industry heterogeneity and innovative performance are not confirmed. Originality/value: This paper refines the connotative dimensions of partner heterogeneity around the core concept of partner heterogeneity in open innovation in the context of emerging region, China. The study presents a systematic, in-depth analysis, and verifies the impact mechanisms of partner heterogeneity in open innovation on innovative performance by integrating the resource-based view, organizational learning theory, and transaction cost theory. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The link between openness and innovative performance has been established as an inverted U-shape relationship, namely, the openness-performance connection is not always positive.

Grøtnes E.;Standardization as open innovation: Two cases from the mobile industry;2009;Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to introduce standardization as a neutral arena for open innovation. The aim is to show that different policies towards open membership in standardization initiatives lead to different open innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach: Two cases are used to illustrate the differences in open innovation processes. The cases are the Android mobile operating system and the service platform developed by the Open Mobile Alliance. The core process types introduced by Gassmann and Enkel are used to show the different open innovation approaches. Findings: Both cases use open innovation to create standards. Open membership leads to a coupled process, while a more restricted membership gives separate inside-out and outside-in processes. The case lead by established firms in the industry has a process where radical innovations are introduced early in the process, while the case lead by newcomers has a process where radical innovations are introduced late in the process. The two cases have different approaches towards commercialization of the products. Android relies on third-party developers, while the Open Mobile Alliance relies on their own members. Research limitations/implications: The cases are from the telecommunication sector and based on standardization of large technical platforms. The findings might not be the same for other sectors. Originality/value: The paper establishes open innovation as a neutral arena for open innovation outside the domain of any single firm. It shows how the openness towards membership influences the choice of open innovation processes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of the paper is to introduce standardization as a neutral arena for Open Innovation.

Gomezel A.S., Rangus K.;An exploration of an entrepreneur’s open innovation mindset in an emerging country;2018;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to connect open innovation and entrepreneurship literature by focusing on the influence of entrepreneurs’ open innovation mindset and alertness on a firm’s financial performance in a country that has recently transitioned from socialism into capitalism. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a sample of 188 entrepreneurs who answered a survey about their personality characteristics in Time 1. In time 2, the authors collected firm-related data from a national database on firms’ financial statements. Findings: The results show that an individual’s level of open innovation mindset has a positive impact on entrepreneurial alertness. The results also show an important and previously under-investigated relationship between entrepreneurial alertness and firm financial performance. Research limitations/implications: This study spurs research in the field of open innovation on the individual level of the entrepreneurs who have considerable influence on small firms’ results, and draws attention into the under-investigated innovation and entrepreneurship agenda in a small and transitioning country. Practical implications: Open innovation starts with an open innovation mindset of entrepreneurs, so entrepreneurs are those who set the open innovation path of firms. Originality/value: While open innovation triggered interest among business practitioners and management innovation scholars, it remained focused on management topics connected to a broad strategic setting of a firm. However, research related to entrepreneurial companies which benefit significantly from external sources of innovation has received scarce attention, and open innovation on the entrepreneur’s individual level even less so. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to connect Open Innovation and entrepreneurship literature by focusing on the influence of entrepreneurs’ Open Innovation mindset and alertness on a firm’s financial performance in a country that has recently transitioned from socialism into capitalism.

Naqshbandi M.M.;Managerial ties and open innovation: examining the role of absorptive capacity;2016;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop and test an integrated model to examine the relationship between managerial ties and two types of open innovation (OI). It takes into account the mediating role of realized absorptive capacity and explains how a firm’s ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it and apply it to commercial ends can facilitate OI. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 259 middle and top managers working across different sectors in the United Arab Emirates. Findings: Results obtained using structural equation modeling show that managerial ties facilitate both in-bound and out-bound OI. Results also establish the mediating role of realized absorptive capacity in these relationships. Research limitations/implications: Use of cross-sectional data as was done in this study has been criticized for being inappropriate to test causal models. Besides the findings may not be generalizable to different industries/cultures/regions. Practical implications: This study suggests that managerial ties act to support OI in firms thus giving the insight that managers should be appreciated to build ties with managers of other firms, universities and government officials. Doing so can help firms achieve better OI outcomes. Firms should arrange means of interaction of their managers with these external knowledge sources such as events and occasions where managers of different firms can interact with each other to foster strong ties among them. Originality/value: The above findings contribute theoretically to OI and managerial ties literature while providing insights for practitioners on how to succeed or avoid failure in their OI initiatives. These insights are novel and are new to the OI and managerial ties theory. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop and test an integrated model to examine the relationship between managerial ties and two types of Open Innovation.

Holgersson M., Granstrand O.;Patenting motives, technology strategies, and open innovation;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate firms’ motives to patent in general, and more specifically how some of these motives depend upon firms’ technology strategies and especially their level of open innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The paper is based on a questionnaire survey sent to chief technology officers (or equivalent) of the largest R&D spenders among Swedish large firms (e.g. ABB, AstraZeneca, Ericsson, and Volvo) and among Swedish small and medium-sized enterprises. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regressions were used to check the impact from open innovation upon the importance of 21 different motives to patent, with a specific focus on protection and bargaining related motives. Findings: The most important motive to patent is to protect product technologies, but protecting freedom to operate is almost as important, followed by a number of other motives. Increasing importance of open innovation in firms is related to stronger bargaining motives to patent, and even stronger protection motives. In fact, when comparing with closed innovation, the results show that open innovation is more strongly positively related with all different motives to patent except for one (to attract customers). This indicates that firms find it more important to patent when engaged in open innovation than when engaged in closed innovation. Originality/value: The paper reports results from the first study that links patenting motives to technology strategies. It contributes to an emerging stream of empirical studies investigating the role of patents in external technology strategies and open innovation, showing that the motives to patent are strengthened within open innovation settings. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate firms’ motives to patent in general, and more specifically how some of these motives depend upon firms’ technology strategies and especially their level of Open Innovation.

Ren R., Yan B., Jian L.;Show me your expertise before teaming up: Sharing online profiles predicts success in open innovation;2019;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how communication practices influence individuals’ team assembly and performance in open innovation contests. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzed behavioral trace data of 4,651 teams and 19,317 participants from a leading open innovation platform, Kaggle. The analyses applied weighted least squares regression and weighted mediation analysis. Findings: Sharing online profiles positively relates to a person’s performance and likelihood of becoming a leader in open innovation teams. Team assembly effectiveness (one’s ability to team up with high-performing teammates) mediates the relationship between online profile sharing and performance. Moreover, sharing personal websites has a stronger positive effect on performance and likelihood of becoming a team leader, compared to sharing links to professional social networking sites (e.g. LinkedIn). Research limitations/implications: As team collaboration becomes increasingly common in open innovation, participants’ sharing of their online profiles becomes an important variable predicting their success. This study extends prior research on virtual team collaboration by highlighting the role of communication practices that occur in the team pre-assembly stage, as an antecedent of team assembly. It also addresses a long-standing debate about the credibility of information online by showing that a narrative-based online profile format (e.g. a personal website) can be more powerful than a standardized format (e.g. LinkedIn). Practical implications: Open innovation organizers should encourage online profile sharing among participants to facilitate effective team assembly in order to improve innovation outcomes. Originality/value: The current study highlights the importance of team assembly in open innovation, especially the role of sharing online profiles in this process. It connects two areas of research that are previously distant, one on team assembly and one on online profile sharing. It also adds new empirical evidence to the discussion about online information credibility. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how communication practices influence individuals’ team assembly and performance in Open Innovation contests.

Zhang D., Li S., Zheng D.;Knowledge search and open innovation performance in an emerging market: Moderating effects of government-enterprise relationship and market focus;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how knowledge search (KS) affects open innovation performance (OIP) in consideration of appropriability hazard in an emerging market context. Design/methodology/approach: The authors identify two types of appropriability hazard related to KS activities in the improvement of OIP: partner-related and market-related hazards, and construct a model of KS to the OIP with the government-enterprise relationship and market focus (MF) as moderating factors of the analysis framework, using the hierarchical regression analysis based on a survey sample of 258 Chinese companies. Findings: The authors find that KS has a stronger positive relationship with OIP in international market-focused enterprises compared with domestic market-focused enterprises. In addition, using a configuration approach, the authors find that KS is more positively related to OIP when enterprises have an international MF and a good relationship with the government, but less in other MF government and enterprises relationship configurations. Originality/value: This paper contributes to previous research work by identifying two types of appropriability hazard related to KS activities in emerging market countries: partner-related and market-related hazards. The authors argue that a positive relationship between KS and OIP is more likely to occur if these appropriability hazards can be mitigated by export MF and a good relationship with the government which has not been demonstrated in previous research. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how knowledge search (KS) affects Open Innovation performance (OIP) in consideration of appropriability hazard in an emerging market context.

Originality/value: This paper contributes to previous research work by identifying two types of appropriability hazard related to KS activities in emerging market countries: partner-related and market-related hazards. The authors argue that a positive relationship between KS and OIP is more likely to occur if these appropriability hazards can be mitigated by export MF and a good relationship with the government which has not been demonstrated in previous research. ;10.1108/MD-04-2016-0211;2-s2.0-85018366422;China;"Business, Management and Accounting; Decision Sciences";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Burcharth A., Præst Knudsen M., Søndergaard H.A.;The role of employee autonomy for open innovation performance;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how organisational activities that formally provide employees with work autonomy explain the performance of open innovation (OI). Design/methodology/approach: The study reports the results of mediation analyses conducted on the basis of survey data from 307 firms. Findings: The economic benefits of both inbound and outbound OI are fully captured only if firms provide employees with time, freedom and independence. The results show that employee autonomy fully mediates the relationship between openness and innovation sales, while the adoption of inbound OI is positively associated with the introduction of new products. Practical implications: The opening of innovation induces managers to provide employees with discretion, as OI requires high levels of flexibility and experimentation. Originality/value: The paper addresses theoretically and empirically the role of job design in the implementation of OI, while also distinguishing between the effects of inbound and outbound practices on innovation performance. © 2017, © Ana Burcharth, Mette Præst Knudsen, Helle Alsted Søndergaard.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how organisational activities that formally provide employees with work autonomy explain the performance of Open Innovation.

Sun F., Hong J., Ma X., Wang C.;Subnational institutions and open innovation: evidence from China;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how subnational institutions within a country explain the performance consequences of open innovation (OI) in emerging market enterprises (EMEs). Design/methodology/approach: The paper conducts a regression analysis by using a novel panel data set comprising of 438 innovative Chinese firms over the period of 2008-2011. Findings: The authors show that although on average openness to external actors improves innovation performance this effect is pronounced for EMEs that operate in subnational regions with a higher level of intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement and of factor market development. The findings point to the context-dependent nature of OI strategy and the complementary effect of institutional parameters in emerging markets and help to reconcile the contrasting findings regarding the effect of OI in the prior literature. Originality/value: This paper extends the literature on OI by suggesting that the analysis of the performance consequences of OI strategy should go beyond the nexus between OI and firm performance, and instead, focus on subnational-specific institutions, such as region-specific IPR enforcement, factor market development and intermediation market development, that may facilitate or constrain the effect of OI model. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine how subnational institutions within a country explain the performance consequences of Open Innovation in emerging market enterprises (EMEs).

Miglietta N., Battisti E., Campanella F.;Value maximization and open innovation in food and beverage industry: evidence from US market;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine listed companies, grouped by sector, that for decades have shown a dividend growth. Referring to the food and beverage (F&B) industry, the authors have investigated the adoption of an open innovation model in order to fill a gap in the existing literature. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a multi-method design linking qualitative and quantitative approaches. The quantitative study was planned in order to identify some US-listed companies, called Dividend Champions that have distributed consistently growing dividends for over 50 years and have beaten the markets. The qualitative study was designed to provide insight into the adoption or not of an open innovation model by the listed companies in the F&B industry in the US market that were selected by the quantitative analysis. Findings: The research is based on an empirical analysis undertaken with 108 listed companies in US markets. In particular, the authors underline 20 companies that over the past 50 years have systematically increased dividend paid, and at the same time, have beaten the market (Standard & Poor’s 500). In all, 30 per cent of the selected companies belong to the consumer goods sector, and F&B companies represent 50 per cent of them. All of these companies (The Coca-Coca Company, Hormel Foods Corporation, and Lancaster Colony Corporation) implement an open innovation model. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first exploratory study based on value maximisation and open innovation. An open innovation model increases competitiveness and the durability of competitive advantage, which are main sources of value creation. The paper highlights evidence from the F&B industry, referred to as Dividend Champions, and the adoption of an open innovation model. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine listed companies, grouped by sector, that for decades have shown a dividend growth.

Zhou H., Yuan Wang K., Yao Y., Huang K.-P.;The moderating role of knowledge structure in the open innovation effect;2019;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between open innovation (OI) and innovative performance, and to explore the moderating effect of knowledge structure, including component knowledge and architectural knowledge, on this particular relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed model was tested with regression analysis of data collected through a questionnaire survey of 231 employees of Chinese manufacturing firms. Findings: The findings indicate that inbound OI is positively related to innovative performance and that outbound OI has an inverted U-shaped effect on innovative performance. By presenting empirical evidence of the moderating effects of component and architectural knowledge, our analysis of results demonstrates that the strong alignment between knowledge structure and OI results in superior innovative performance. Originality/value: This study addresses the controversial issues brought up by previous studies with findings of an inverted U-shaped effect of outbound OI on innovative performance. By exploring the moderating effect of knowledge structure, the authors provide insights into how internal contextual factors in relation to organizational knowledge can affect the efficacy of the inbound and outbound OI on innovative performance. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between Open Innovation and innovative performance, and to explore the moderating effect of knowledge structure, including component knowledge and architectural knowledge, on this particular relationship.

Oltra M.J., Flor M.L., Alfaro J.A.;Open innovation and firm performance: the role of organizational mechanisms;2018;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the use of open innovation (OI) practices and firm performance, and the role of organizational mechanisms (OMs) (formalization and decentralization) as moderator variables. Design/methodology/approach: The authors build a theoretical framework to define a set of hypotheses that are then verified in an empirical study. These theoretical propositions are tested by using the data gathered from a survey addressed to 244 firms in Spanish low- and medium-technology industries. Findings: With regard to inbound practices, the practices oriented to cooperate with partners in a R&D context have a positive influence. The results show that outbound practices, either by direct generation of revenues from licensing payments or, more indirectly, through the indirect marketing and technical benefits that can stem from revealing have a positive effect on firm performance. Coupled practices, which are related to participation in clusters and innovation networks, have the highest impact on firm performance. In the industrial context examined, decentralization exerts a positive effect which enhances the effect of outbound practices meanwhile formalization reduces their positive effect. Practical implications: This study helps practitioners in low- and medium-technology firms to determine which OI practices are most beneficial to firm performance and how formalization and decentralization can influence the relationship between OI and firm performance. Originality/value: This study helps determine the influence of OI practices in terms of inbound, outbound and coupled types through an analysis of low- and medium-technology firms.

Naqshbandi M.M., Tabche I., Choudhary N.;Managing open innovation: The roles of empowering leadership and employee involvement climate;2019;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between empowering leadership style and two types of open innovation: inbound and outbound. The intervening mechanism of employee involvement climate in these relationships is also investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses data collected using a questionnaire survey from middle and top managers working in various firms in northern India. Findings: Results reveal that empowering leadership positively affects both types of open innovation. Thus empowering leadership supports followers to seek, integrate and diffuse new ideas and knowledge to improve open innovation outcomes. Further, the mediating role of employee involvement climate is established for empowering leadership-inbound open innovation link. This suggests that an empowering leadership style creates an employee involvement climate that empowers employees and involves them in relevant decision-making which consequently enhances a firms inbound open innovation performance. Research limitations/implications: This study used a cross-sectional research design and a relatively small sample size. These limitations can affect generalizability of the findings. Originality/value: The paper contributes to leadership and open innovation literatures and provides insights into how the practitioners can use an appropriate leadership style to maximize success in the open innovation paradigm.

Ramirez-Portilla A., Cagno E., Brown T.E.;Open innovation in specialized SMEs: the case of supercars;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the influence that adopting open innovation (OI) has on the innovativeness and performance of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper also examines the adoption of OI within a firm’s practices and models, and within the three dimensions of firm sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data from 48 specialized SMEs manufacturing supercars were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. SmartPLS software was used to conduct a path analysis and test the proposed framework. Findings: The findings suggest that high adoption of OI models tends to increase firm innovativeness. Similarly, the adoption of OI practices has a positive effect on innovativeness but to a lesser extent than OI models. The moderation results of innovativeness further show that OI models and practices can benefit the performance of SMEs. Specifically, two dimensions of performance – environmental and social performance – were found to be greatly influenced by OI. Research limitations/implications: Due to parsimony in the investigated model, this study only focuses on OI adoption as practices and models without considering its drivers or other contingency factors. Practical implications: This paper could help practitioners in SMEs better understand the benefits of adopting OI to be more innovative but also more sustainable. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature on the role of OI practices and models regarding the dimensions of firm sustainability performance by being the first paper to investigate this relationship in the context of small and medium manufacturers of supercars. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the influence that adopting Open Innovation has on the innovativeness and performance of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Howells J., Ramlogan R., Cheng S.-L.;Universities in an open innovation system: A UK perspective;2012;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature and impact of higher education institution (HEI) in a distributed, open innovation system using a survey of some 600 firms in the UK. Design/methodology/approach: Primary data are used from a postal questionnaire survey of 600 firms across three UK regions: Wales, the North West and the East of England. Findings: The analysis reveals significant differences in firm collaboration with HEIs across the UK and the value and impact that such collaborations have on firm development. The nature and effects of such collaboration vary significantly between the type of firm involved and their location and the analysis investigates this in relation to various aspects of innovative activity and firm performance. Originality/value: Although much of the nature and effects of such collaboration are as one would expect, some of the results are counter-intuitive and highlight the care we should place on assessing the role of universities and other HEIs in open innovation systems. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature and impact of higher education institution (HEI) in a distributed, Open Innovation system using a survey of some 600 firms in the UK.

Vega A., Brown D., Chiasson M.;Open innovation and SMEs: Exploring policy and the scope for improvements in university-based public programmes through a multidisciplinary lens;2012;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore, through the use of a multidisciplinary lens, the policy context and the scope for improvements in university-based public programmes focused on improving innovation in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Design/methodology/approach: The authors use the street-level bureaucracy (SLB), combined with the systems of innovation approach (SIA) and diagnostic analysis (DA) to understand the context components that impact on public programme services. The study is part of a research programme oriented to the diffusion of information systems in SMEs and which used original interview-based programme support case studies, interviews with regional policy managers, and documentation relating to the policy system and different public programmes. Although the empirical work was UK and European Union centric the results of the research have wide applicability. Findings: The paper establishes the importance of programme contexts for diagnosing and providing a basis for public programme improvements. It further demonstrates the robustness of the context analysis framework to provide insights into proposed policy changes. The responsibility of improving programme contexts relies on actors that operate outside programme organisations, for instance EU funding bodies, government departments in charge of SME policies, public-private partnerships, and private evaluators. Given this complexity it is suggested that SME associations have a potentially important role in increasing participation by SMEs in the public programme for innovation and knowledge support policy. Despite possible policy changes the requirement for public programme support for innovation and hence the role of universities as programme providers is confirmed and expanded. Research limitations/implications: The results demonstrate the value of a multidisciplinary framework to analyse programme interventions at both macro and micro levels and provide a basis for programme policy and policy implementation improvements. Originality/value: This research is a novel attempt to use the SLB, SIA and DA to public programme university-based interventions in SMEs and SME policies in general. It complements extant research on open innovation and knowledge exchange by extending the concept of public programme contexts.

Bayona-Saez C., Cruz-Cázares C., García-Marco T., Sánchez García M.;Open innovation in the food and beverage industry;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend the knowledge into the relationship between open innovation (OI) and firm’s innovative performance. Specifically, the authors aim to determine whether the benefits of OI practices are different for Food and Beverage (FnB) firms as compared to those of other sectors. The FnB industry is relevant in terms of employment GDP generation in the UE, characterised by high integration and low-tech intensity. Design/methodology/approach: In order to achieve the goal and obtain robust results, the authors consider four OI dimensions and four innovation performance measures using panel data (2004-2011) from 10,771 FnB and non-FnB firms using Tobit and Logit models by random effects. Findings: The authors test and confirm the presence of the classical inverted U-shape relationship between OI and firm innovative performance for FnB and non-FnB companies. However, the optimal number of external sources of knowledge used is lesser for FnB than the rest of the companies. Originality/value: The paper compares the OI effects in a traditional and low-tech industry vs other industries considering four innovation outputs (product innovations, process innovations, incremental innovation and radical innovation). © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend the knowledge into the relationship between Open Innovation and firm’s innovative performance.

Alassaf D., Dabić M., Shifrer D., Daim T.;The impact of open-border organization culture and employees’ knowledge, attitudes, and rewards with regards to open innovation: an empirical study;2020;"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to fill a significant research gap in academic literature pertaining to open innovation (OI). To do so, this paper empirically tests the impact of organizational culture, employees’ knowledge, attitudes and rewards as antecedents and mediators of OI adoption in organizations, facilitating a more thorough understanding by using an empirical multi-level approach. Design/methodology/approach: This paper analyzes the results of the “Identification of Industrial Needs for Open Innovation Education in Europe” survey through a quantitative analysis using logistic regression models. This survey includes 528 employees working in 28 different industrial sectors in 37 countries, most of which are in Europe. Findings: The results suggest a positive impact of organizational characteristics on the adoption of OI (i.e. including the adoption of outside-in and inside-out OI activities in participating organizations), showing that the openness of an organization’s culture increases its likelihood of adopting an OI paradigm. More importantly, the results highlight the positive mediating effect of employees’ knowledge and rewards on this relationship. Research limitations/implications: The data set that was the basis of this paper was generated in European countries, the results of the analysis are limited and appropriate for this region and may vary when applied to other regions of the world. Practical implications: The proposed multi-level approach offers new insight into organizational knowledge. It enables the improvement of OI and knowledge management practices in organizations by assisting practitioners and academics in recognizing the relationship between organizational culture; employees’ knowledge, attitudes and rewards; and the adoption of the OI paradigm. Social implications: This paper offers a possible explanation on why open-border cultures are more likely to have a successful OI adoption, by relating it to factors that advance in the presence of an open-border culture, such as active participation of OI relative departments in knowledge sourcing and knowledge exchange, and rewarding employees for OI activities. Originality/value: This paper presents a new framework which links organizational culture to OI, moving on from merely examining culture in terms of its positive or negative impact on OI adoption. It contributes to research on the OI paradigm and knowledge management by highlighting the significance of antecedents and mediators from a multi-level perspective using multiple units of analysis. Most previous studies focus on a single unit of analysis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to fill a significant research gap in academic literature pertaining to Open Innovation.

Findings: The results suggest a positive impact of organizational characteristics on the adoption of OI (i.e. including the adoption of outside-in and inside-out OI activities in participating organizations), showing that the openness of an organization’s culture increases its likelihood of adopting an OI paradigm. More importantly, the results highlight the positive mediating effect of employees’ knowledge and rewards on this relationship. Research limitations/implications: The data set that was the basis of this paper was generated in European countries, the results of the analysis are limited and appropriate for this region and may vary when applied to other regions of the world. Practical implications: The proposed multi-level approach offers new insight into organizational knowledge. It enables the improvement of OI and knowledge management practices in organizations by assisting practitioners and academics in recognizing the relationship between organizational culture; employees’ knowledge, attitudes and rewards; and the adoption of the OI paradigm. Social implications: This paper offers a possible explanation on why open-border cultures are more likely to have a successful OI adoption, by relating it to factors that advance in the presence of an open-border culture, such as active participation of OI relative departments in knowledge sourcing and knowledge exchange, and rewarding employees for OI activities. Originality/value: This paper presents a new framework which links organizational culture to OI, moving on from merely examining culture in terms of its positive or negative impact on OI adoption. It contributes to research on the OI paradigm and knowledge management by highlighting the significance of antecedents and mediators from a multi-level perspective using multiple units of analysis. Most previous studies focus on a single unit of analysis. ";10.1108/JKM-02-2020-0122;2-s2.0-85089485303;United States;Business, Management and Accounting;Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Toma A., Secundo G., Passiante G.;Open innovation and intellectual property strategies: Empirical evidence from a bio-pharmaceutical case study;2018;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the main Intellectual Property (IP) protection strategies adopted in the R&D phases of a company operating in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, according to an open innovation (OI) approach. Design/methodology/approach: In order to assess how R&D intensive firms adopt IP strategies during OI practices, this research uses a single case-study design. The case has been studied over an extended period of time (from 2008 to 2015), triangulating data and information by means of multiple interviews with different key informants and projects documents. The novelty of the research justifies the use of a single case study. Findings: The study reveals how a mix of formal and informal tools for IP protection are used, with a final attempt to maintain control over different technological solutions during their validation process and profiting from stable R&D collaborations with research partners. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study relate to the single case study methodology as well as to some peculiarities of the analyzed company and of the Bio-Pharmaceutical industry. Practical implications: Research managers could find some food for thought in the adoption of OI approaches for reducing costs and risks associated with technological uncertainty, with particular attention to the strategic role of IP rights. Originality/value: Despite knowledge protection being widely recognized to be a critical issue for implementing OI approaches, how IP strategies should be used in the different phases of R&D is still debatable. Moreover, few empirical studies relate to the adoption of optimal combinations of IP tools in relation to the different R&D phases in such technology intensive industries as the bio-pharmaceutical industry. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the main Intellectual Property (IP) protection strategies adopted in the R&D phases of a company operating in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, according to an Open Innovation approach.

Wei L.H., Thurasamy R., Popa S.;Managing virtual teams for open innovation in Global Business Services industry;2018;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of human dimensions, team climates, and technological features on Global Virtual Team (GVT) performance in the Malaysian Global Business Services (GBS) industry. Attention has also been paid to examine the moderating effect of team diversity and the extent of virtuality on GVT performance. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected using structured questionnaire and tested using partial least square – structural equation modelling. The authors collected 263 sample and the assessment of reflective measurement models, structural model, reliability and validity were conducted subsequently. Findings: This paper found that team climates like team cohesion, team confidence, and team knowledge, skills, and abilities demonstrated different impact on the human dimensions which include trust and creativity. It will then subsequently affect GVTs’ performance. Besides, team diversity which comprised of three major components that include age diversity, functional diversity, and attitudes/values diversity was found to moderate the relationships between the antecedents and consequent. In spite of that, the extent of virtuality was found to have no moderating effects on the relationships between the team creativity and trust and perceived team performance. Originality/value: As nowadays an increasing number of firms are becoming global, inquiring into GVTs efficient management is of crucial importance for successful implementation of open innovation practices, while GBS companies could represent the most suitable setting to examine the GVT’s underlying principles. This paper integrates adaptive structuration theory with input-mediator-output-input model to provide a holistic study on GVTs’ performance. In addition, this study also illustrated how the extent of virtually can be measured quantitatively. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of human dimensions, team climates, and technological features on Global Virtual Team (GVT) performance in the Malaysian Global Business Services (GBS) industry.

Capone F., Innocenti N.;Open innovation and network dynamics. An analysis of openness of co-patenting collaborations in Florence, Italy;2020;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relational dynamics for innovation and, in particular, the impact of the openness of innovation process on the innovation capacity of organisations in restricted geographical contexts. Design/methodology/approach: Through a negative binomial regression, the work analyses how the characteristics of the openness of the organisation’s innovation process in the period 2004-2010 influence the firm’s patent productivity in the following period (2011-2016). Findings: The breadth of the open innovation (OI) process, here measured by the number of external network ties that an organisation realises for the realisation of its patents, has a positive effect on patent productivity. The depth of the openness, that is, the intensity of external network ties, has an equally positive influence on the innovative performance. However, after a tipping point, the patent productivity tends to decrease, underlining the costs and problems of OI practices. Research limitations/implications: This study considers only patent collaborations in the city of Florence. Therefore, it focusses on codified innovations and on a single territorial case study. Practical implications: The results underline the importance of the adoption of OI practices in restricted geographical contexts (such as cities, clusters or industrial districts) but with several limitations. Only collaborating more with others does not foster the organisation’s invention productivity, but different types of evidence are found here. Originality/value: An original database has been created, containing all the information on patents realised in the area of Florence from 2004 until 2016, and a social networks analysis was applied to identify the local innovation networks. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relational dynamics for innovation and, in particular, the impact of the openness of innovation process on the innovation capacity of organisations in restricted geographical contexts.

Matricano D., Candelo E., Sorrentino M., Martínez-Martínez A.;Absorbing in-bound knowledge within open innovation processes. The case of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles;2019;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the way companies involved in Open Innovation Processes (OIPs) routinize the procedure through which they can absorb in-bound knowledge, i.e. knowledge that comes from the outside and, in particular, from the crowd. In-bound knowledge passes through the phases of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. Thus, companies need to define mechanisms and paths – related to their potential and realized absorptive capacity –to manage and exploit it. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper is based on a longitudinal case study, an OIP launched by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) that has already been implemented for three times. Multiple direct interviews with FCA top managers have allowed rebuilding the routinized procedure through which the company absorbs in-bound knowledge. Findings: To routinize the procedure of absorbing in-bound knowledge, the company has settled specific mechanisms and paths and has established some bottlenecks over the process of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation of in-bound knowledge. These mechanisms and path, as well as these bottlenecks, are identified and descripted in the paper. Research limitations/implications: Beyond the limitations linked to the use of a single case study, another limitation might be the reference to a big company in a specific industry. Anyway, with due caution, achieved findings can be referred to other industries as well. Originality/value: This paper contributes to exploring if and how companies managing OIPs routinize the procedure through which they can absorb in-bound knowledge. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the way companies involved in Open Innovation Processes (OIPs) routinize the procedure through which they can absorb in-bound knowledge, i.e. knowledge that comes from the outside and, in particular, from the crowd.

Wilson K.B., Bhakoo V., Samson D.;Crowdsourcing: A contemporary form of project management with linkages to open innovation and novel operations;2018;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to link crowdsourcing, operations management (OM) and project management (PM). The study demonstrates how crowdsourcing as an open innovation mechanism is operationalised within a complex PM context. Specifically, the study seeks to understand how crowdsourcing as a novel form of OM improves key outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted exploratory research involving five pure-play crowdsourcing firms based in the USA and Australia. Findings: The findings indicate that the firms practise a form of crowdsourcing that allows flexible, efficient and low risk operations and links to contemporary notions of PM such as projectification and project society. The crowd can be used in a new manner to boost success factors tied to PM through open innovation and operational novelty. In terms of OM, crowdsourcing offers flexibility, speed, dynamism and scalability to project processes. Research limitations/implications: This research is based on five case studies. Further fine-grained, longitudinal research is required to fully understand this phenomenon in a wider range of contexts. Practical implications: The paper contributes to practices tied to open innovation and provides guidance on how organisations might use large crowds to enhance PM success. Originality/value: The study represents early scholarship on crowdsourcing and project operations. It makes three contributions. First, the authors introduce a new theoretical framework linking PM and novel aspects of crowdsourcing to extend understandings of projectification, as well as open innovation frameworks. Second, the authors showcase the flexibility and fluidity of the crowdsourcing project process. Third, the authors examine crowdsourcing operations in terms of size, efficiency and scalability which results in timely and efficient output due to innovative technology, along with the element of trust among stakeholders. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to link crowdsourcing, operations management (OM) and project management (PM).

Cammarano A., Caputo M., Lamberti E., Michelino F.;Open innovation and intellectual property: a knowledge-based approach;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a patent-based framework for investigating the effect of previous and current open innovation (OI) adoption on firms’ knowledge management strategies and type of innovation output. Design/methodology/approach: Patent data are employed for gauging innovation practices, exploitation vs exploration strategies, specialization vs diversification choices and type of innovation. The study is performed on a sample of 1,280 patents granted to 66 top R&D spending bio-pharmaceutical companies. The year of analysis is 2010. Findings: The previous recourse to specific innovation practices influences the current practice selection. R&D collaboration, outsourcing and mergers and acquisitions are employed to pursue exploration. Past purchase of patents increases the likelihood to achieve architectural and radical innovation in current activities. Research limitations/implications: The work recommends the use of patent data to gauge many key elements for knowledge and innovation management. Results exhort scholars to investigate innovation practices at the knowledge domain level in order to detect specific behaviors. Practical implications: The study provides a methodology for supporting decision-makers in assessing firms’ OI adoption, also performing the benchmark with competitors and R&D partners. Given the high computational effort required for applying the methodology, the authors are planning to give access to the software specifically developed for this study. Originality/value: The work contributes to the current debate considering the effect of a combination of innovation practices on knowledge management strategies and type of innovation output, with a particular focus on OI activities. Moreover, the separation between the impact of previous and current innovation practices provides useful insights. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a patent-based framework for investigating the effect of previous and current Open Innovation adoption on firms’ knowledge management strategies and type of innovation output.

Sun Y., Tuertscher P., Majchrzak A., Malhotra A.;Pro-socially motivated interaction for knowledge integration in crowd-based open innovation;2020;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study how the online temporary crowd shares knowledge in a way that fosters the integration of their diverse knowledge. Having the crowd integrate its knowledge to offer solution-ideas to ill-structured problems posed by organizations is one of the desired outcomes of crowd-based open innovation because, by integrating others’ knowledge, the ideas are more likely to consider the many divergent issues related to solving the ill-structured problem. Unfortunately, the diversity of knowledge content offered by heterogeneous specialists in the online temporary crowd makes integration difficult, and the lean social context of the crowd makes extensive dialogue to resolve integration issues impractical. The authors address this issue by exploring theoretically how the manner in which interaction is organically conducted during open innovation challenges enables the generation of integrative ideas. The authors hypothesize that, as online crowds organically share knowledge based upon successful pro-socially motivated interaction, they become more productive in generating integrative ideas. Design/methodology/approach: Using a multilevel mixed-effects model, this paper analyzed 2,244 posts embedded in 747 threads with 214 integrative ideas taken from 10 open innovation challenges. Findings: Integrative ideas were more likely to occur after pro-socially motivated interactions. Research limitations/implications: Ideas that integrate knowledge about the variety of issues that relate to solving an ill-structured problem are desired outcomes of crowd-based open innovation challenges. Given that members of the crowd in open innovation challenges rarely engage in dialogue, a new theory is needed to explain why integrative ideas emerge at all. The authors’ adaptation of pro-social motivation interaction theory helps to provide such a theoretical explanation. Practitioners of crowd-based open innovation should endeavor to implement systems that encourage the crowd members to maintain a high level of activeness in pro-socially motivated interaction to ensure that their knowledge is integrated as solutions are generated. Originality/value: The present study extends the crowd-based open innovation literature by identifying new forms of social interaction that foster more integrated ideas from the crowd, suggesting the mitigating role of pro-socially motivated interaction in the negative relationship between knowledge diversity and knowledge integration. This study fills in the research gap in knowledge management research describing a need for conceptual frameworks explaining how to manage the increasing complexity of knowledge in the context of crowd-based collaboration for innovation. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study how the online temporary crowd shares knowledge in a way that fosters the integration of their diverse knowledge.

Díaz-Díaz N.L., de Saá-Pérez P.;The interaction between external and internal knowledge sources: An open innovation view;2014;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the external sources of knowledge that better exploit internal knowledge in order to innovate. Design/methodology/approach: A balanced panel of 1,266 firms that respond to the Survey of Business Strategies for a five-year period was used, which represents a total of 6,330 observations. Findings: The influence of the absorptive capacity on new products is significant, with an inverted U-shaped relationship. The interaction between external sources of knowledge and firm's absorptive capacity has a negative effect on innovation up to a certain level (substitution effect), after which that interaction improves the innovation of firms, displaying a complementary effect. Practical implications: Firms with excess of internal sources of knowledge do not obtain better innovative results because overtime firms tend to inertia and need external sources of knowledge to obtain new knowledge. Firms must be conscious that the effect on innovation of using a strategy of external knowledge acquisition could be different depending on their internal knowledge base level. Thus, those firms that select their strategies to combine knowledge appropriately will have better results. Originality/value: This paper reveals that the positive effect of internal sources of knowledge on innovation decline after it reaches a high level because those firms with strong absorptive capacity may enter a state of organizational inertia that reduces their innovation. This research enhances the importance of identifying each of the external knowledge sources likely to be used, since their influence on innovation differs depending on the level of internal knowledge. Finally, this study is based on panel data models, which allows us to control unobservable heterogeneity improving earlier studies that had to rely on cross-sectional data. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the external sources of knowledge that better exploit internal knowledge in order to innovate.

Originality/value: This paper reveals that the positive effect of internal sources of knowledge on innovation decline after it reaches a high level because those firms with strong absorptive capacity may enter a state of organizational inertia that reduces their innovation. This research enhances the importance of identifying each of the external knowledge sources likely to be used, since their influence on innovation differs depending on the level of internal knowledge. Finally, this study is based on panel data models, which allows us to control unobservable heterogeneity improving earlier studies that had to rely on cross-sectional data. ;10.1108/JKM-07-2013-0257;2-s2.0-84900398755;Spain;Business, Management and Accounting;Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Brem A., Nylund P.A., Hitchen E.L.;Open innovation and intellectual property rights: How do SMEs benefit from patents, industrial designs, trademarks and copyrights?;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between open innovation and the use of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The authors consider patents, industrial designs (i.e. design patents in the USA), trademarks, and copyrights. Design/methodology/approach: The relationships between open innovation, IPRs, and profitability are tested with random-effects panel regressions on data from the Spanish Community Innovation Survey for 2,873 firms spanning the years 2008-2013. Findings: A key result is that SMEs do not benefit from open innovation or from patenting in the same way as larger firms. Furthermore, the results show that SMEs profit in different ways from IPR, depending on their size and the corresponding IPR. Research limitations/implications: The different impact of IPRs on the efficiency of open innovation in firms of varying sizes highlights the importance of further investigation into IP strategies and into open innovation in SMEs. Practical implications: Industrial designs are currently the most efficient IPR for SMEs to protect their intellectual property in open innovation collaborations. Depending on the company size, the use of different IPRs is recommended. Moreover, firms should seek to increase the efficiency of open innovation and the use of IPRs. Social implications: The high impact of SMEs on employment highlights the importance of fomenting efficient innovation processes in such firms. Originality/value: This paper opens the black box of IPR in relation to open innovation in SMEs, and draws distinctive conclusions with regards to patents, industrial designs, trademarks, and copyrights. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between Open Innovation and the use of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

This adds to the understanding of the particular patterns of open innovation (OI) and what characterizes the innovation emerging through this approach. Design/methodology/approach: Tests are performed on the effect of internal and external collaboration on the degree of newness (incremental/radical) in innovation projects. This adds to the understanding of the particular patterns of OI and what characterizes the innovation emerging through this approach. The empirical analysis is based on a data set including responses from 512 Danish engineers. Findings: The results show that external collaboration has significantly different effects on the degree of newness depending on the type of external partners involved, and they also show that radical innovation output is positively related to involving the R&D department (internal) and universities (external involvement) and negatively related to involving suppliers. Originality/value: The results provide a more detailed understanding of how different OI patterns affect the development of incremental vs radical innovation in existing organizations. In particular, three findings add new insights into how OI affects innovation to reach the highest degree of newness: high importance of collaboration with external partners with distinct interests and skills; low reliance on existing customers and suppliers for the development of radical innovation; and narrow and focused internal involvement rather than broad internal involvement. © 2017, © Astrid Heidemann Lassen, Bjørge Timenes Laugen.";"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to test the effect of internal and external collaboration on the degree of newness (incremental/radical) in innovation projects.

Abbate T., Codini A.P., Aquilani B.;Knowledge co-creation in Open Innovation Digital Platforms: processes, tools and services;2019;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand how Open Innovation Digital Platforms (OIDPs) can facilitate and support knowledge co-creation in Open Innovation (OI) processes. Specifically, it intends to investigate the contribution of OIDPs-oriented to successfully implement all the phases of interactive coupled OI processes. Design/methodology/approach: The paper carries out an exploratory qualitative analysis, adopting the single case study method. The case here investigated is Open Innovation Platform Regione Lombardia (OIPRL). Findings: The case study sheds light on how OIPRL supports knowledge co-creation through its processes, tools and services as a co-creator intermediary. In its launch stage, the platform simply aimed at giving firms a tool to “find partners” and financial resources to achieve innovative projects. Now, however, the platform has developed into an engagement platform for knowledge co-creation. Research limitations/implications: One limitation lies in the particular perspective used to perform the case study: the perspective of the digital platform itself. Future research should focus on the individuals engaged in the platform to better investigate the processes, tools and services used to implement the OI approach. Practical implications: The paper suggests ways in which OIDPs could be used by firms for effective exploration, acquisition, integration and development of valuable knowledge. Originality/value: The study conceptualizes the role of OIDPs in shaping knowledge co-creation, assuming that the platforms act as Open Innovation Intermediaries (OIIs). Specifically, OIDPs can be observed to function as “co-creator intermediaries” that define, develop and implement dedicated processes, specific tools and appropriate services for supporting knowledge co-creation activities. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand how Open Innovation Digital Platforms (OIDPs) can facilitate and support knowledge co-creation in Open Innovation processes.

Venturini K., Verbano C.;Open innovation in the public sector: Resources and performance of research-based spin-offs;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to verify and improve the framework assessing the evolution and importance of the technological, human, social and financial resources of an Indian research-based spin-off (RBSO) throughout its four stages of development by Vohora et al. (2004). Design/methodology/approach: The open innovation (OI) phenomenon is spreading among public organizations. One of the OI practices used by the public research centers to market their technologies is to set up new business entities called RBSOs. Many studies have focused on spin-offs but there are still some gaps. To overcome the existing limitations, the authors built a framework which they tested on three previous case studies. Findings: The results obtained show how a parent organization and its incubator can play fundamental roles in creating and developing a successful RBSO. This is done by supplying managerial staff and providing access to skills, funds and other material and immaterial resources. Research limitations/implications: The limitations of this study are related to the sectoral and geopolitical factors of the single case analyzed. For this reason, the observations that emerge should be supported by other empirical analyses. Originality/value: The findings of this study can offer a better understanding of the spin-off life to managers, researchers, public organizations and government agencies. They can learn how to improve policies and practices of technology transfer and strengthen the national industrial system. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to verify and improve the framework assessing the evolution and importance of the technological, human, social and financial resources of an Indian research-based spin-off (RBSO) throughout its four stages of development by Vohora et al.

Lee S.M., Hwang T., Choi D.;Open innovation in the public sector of leading countries;2012;Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the current open innovation practices in the public sector of leading countries. Design/methodology/approach: Using a framework based on the role of the government in open innovation, this study analyses a profile of early open innovation adopters based on collected data from secondary sources. Findings: First, the USA, Australia and Singapore developed open innovation policies at the national level, facilitating a positive innovation climate. Many projects, especially those in online platforms, were established under these policies. Second, although outside-in open innovation principles seem to be popular, there have been emerging attempts to exploit the value of government data through inside-out approaches. Research limitations/implications: Most governments are in the early stages of adoption of open innovation and are in the process of understanding relevant issues. Future research should investigate how governments adopt open innovation, in particular inside-out initiatives. Practical implications: Governments should develop an overarching strategic plan, which would help its employees to recognise that new change is consistent with the needs of their workplace practices. Some organizations and projects led by citizens help the government engage external ideas in solving issues that are beyond its control.

Wang Y., Guo B., Yin Y.;Open innovation search in manufacturing firms: the role of organizational slack and absorptive capacity;2017;Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore organizational factors that act as antecedents of open innovation search. The authors aim to empirically examine whether the extent to which the organizational slack is absorbed determines its influence on firms’ openness in innovation search. In addition, the authors also examine the moderating effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between slack and open innovation search. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopted secondary data from multiple sources (NBER, Compustat and US census) and then constructed a ten-year balanced panel dataset of 298 manufacturers. The generalized least square method was used to explore the determinants of open innovation search among manufacturing firms. Findings: The results of this study reveal that the absorption level of organizational slack indeed determines the openness in innovation search. Specifically, absorbed slack negatively affects a firm’s openness in innovation search, whereas unabsorbed slack promotes open innovation search. Additionally, the relationship between absorbed slack and open innovation search will be less negative with the increase of absorptive capacity. Originality/value: Different from most previous studies that have examined the performance effect of open search among high-tech and large enterprises, this study focuses on the antecedents of open search strategy in both high- and low-tech, large and small firms. The findings reveal that different forms of organizational slack divergently influence a firm’s open search strategy, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between organizational slack and knowledge search behavior in a broader context, as well as the understanding of the moderating effect of absorptive capacity. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The purpose of this study is to explore organizational factors that act as antecedents of Open Innovation search.

Wilhelm M., Dolfsma W.;Managing knowledge boundaries for open innovation – lessons from the automotive industry;2018;Purpose: The rising need to innovate and obtain knowledge from more distant knowledge sources calls for new innovation strategies and a better integration of other external actors who lie outside the traditional automotive supply chain. Such an open innovation strategy challenges organizational boundaries both on the firm and supply chain level, yet our understanding of the functioning of such boundaries and how they can be managed to allow for purposive knowledge flows is limited. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: In a longitudinal case study, the authors trace the development of the first open innovation network in the German automotive industry over a period of five years based on archival data, semi-structured interviews, and field observations. Findings: While the automotive industry is advanced in collaborating with suppliers for innovation, routines for assessing and integrating ideas from sources outside the supply chain are still underdeveloped. The authors show which current knowledge boundaries pose obstacles for open innovation initiatives in this industry, and how they could be mediated through the involvement of gatekeepers. Originality/value: The authors challenge and clarify the notion of the “permeability of organizational boundaries” in the open innovation literature and investigate the role of gatekeepers for open innovation. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: The rising need to innovate and obtain knowledge from more distant knowledge sources calls for new innovation strategies and a better integration of other external actors who lie outside the traditional automotive supply chain.

Reed R., Storrud-Barnes S., Jessup L.;How open innovation affects the drivers of competitive advantage: Trading the benefits of IP creation and ownership for free invention;2012;Purpose: This paper aims to explore how community-controlled open innovation affects cost- and differentiation-based competitive advantage, and to explain how it allows some sources of economic rent to remain while others are taken away. Although models of competitive-advantage remain relevant, open innovation means that the main drivers of performance are changed. Open innovation means that there are implications for firms' ability to profit from intellectual property that they do not own. The paper seeks to address those issues. Design/methodology/approach: The work is conceptual. Findings: Economic rents from property rights disappear, those from economies of scale and capital requirements are reduced, but those from experience-curve effects, differentiation, distribution, and switching costs remain. Similarly, rents from the difficult-to-imitate resources of networks and reputation remain intact, and while those from employee knowhow and culture remain, they are likely to be in reduced amounts. Research limitations/implications: Propositions are provided for empirical testing. There also is a need to identify breakpoints between open-innovation benefits and the costs associated with lost innovation skills, and a need to extend this work to firm-controlled and third-party controlled open innovation. Practical implications: For some firms open innovation will not adversely affect competitive advantage but those whose advantage is driven by barriers to entry, skills in innovation and anticipating customer needs, or that rely on proprietary product designs, can lose in the longer term. Originality/value: Where the majority of work examining open innovation addresses property rights, economic rationales, governance, and processes, this work focuses on the effects of open innovation on strategy content and consequent firm performance. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose: This paper aims to explore how community-controlled Open Innovation affects cost- and differentiation-based competitive advantage, and to explain how it allows some sources of economic rent to remain while others are taken away.

Bello-Pintado A., Bianchi C.;Consequences of open innovation: effects on skill-driven recruitment;2019;Purpose: This paper aims to focus on the human side of inbound open innovation by analyzing the effects that the adoption of different knowledge search strategies for innovation has on new recruitment needs. Design/methodology/approach: Building on several theoretical perspectives, the study proposes three hypotheses regarding the relationship between openness and the need to recruit people with high technical and social skills. Using a pooled panel data from the Uruguayan Innovation Survey between 2004 and 2012, the authors identify open strategies followed by the firm. Findings: The estimation results using pooled panel data confirm that the adoption of inbound open search strategies for innovation demands the recruitment of new employees with higher technical and social skills. Technical skills are more likely to be demanded than social skills. The effects observed are moderated by the intensity in the use of knowledge and information sources (KISs). Originality/value: This paper revisits the analysis of specific knowledge search strategies at the firm level. In doing so, the study looks for the effects of specific strategies combining different knowledge sources and considers different levels of use of external KISs, from narrow to wide. While other studies have analyzed the human factor as a determinant of the success of openness for innovation, this paper re-examines the direction of this relationship. Finally, the study contributes to the evidence from a Latin American country, where these topics have received less attention. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: This paper aims to focus on the human side of inbound Open Innovation by analyzing the effects that the adoption of different knowledge search strategies for innovation has on new recruitment needs.

Chaurasia S.S., Kaul N., Yadav B., Shukla D.;Open innovation for sustainability through creating shared value-role of knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure;2020;Purpose: This paper aims to identify the prominent themes of open innovation for sustainability (OIS) and establish their inter-relationships. Moreover, it examines the importance of success factors (i.e. knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure) and their configuration for co-creating shared value for OIS in manufacturing micro small and medium enterprises. Design/methodology/approach: The first stage of investigation determines the relationship between concepts using the bibliometric technique. The second stage examines predictors (e.g. knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure) that contribute to the desired outcomes (creation of shared value in OIS) through necessary condition analysis. Findings: The investigation demonstrates that all three conditions are necessary for (at different levels) creating shared values for OIS. More specifically, the investigation shows that the different levels of creation of shared value outcomes do require organizations to configure organizational interventions at different levels of the knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure. Practical implications: To use the concept of open innovation (OI), organizations need to expand their view beyond their existing resource pool and business environment, to include their partners and stakeholders for more inclusivity. Such creation of shared value for OI does require active participation, interaction and collaboration with both manufacturer, retailers and other stakeholders, for developing an insight in creating value for sustainability problem-solving context. Originality/value: The investigation advances the existing body of knowledge that propagates the significance of knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure as the antecedent to increase the creation of shared value for sustainability by organizations.

Scuotto V., Del Giudice M., Bresciani S., Meissner D.;Knowledge-driven preferences in informal inbound open innovation modes. An explorative view on small to medium enterprises;2017;Purpose: This paper aims to investigate three key factors (i.e. cognitive dimensions, the knowledge-driven approach and absorptive capacity) that are likely to determine the preference for informal inbound open innovation (OI) modes, through the lens of the OI model and knowledge-based view (KBV). The innovation literature has differentiated these collaborations into informal inbound OI entry modes and formal inbound OI modes, offering an advocative and conceptual view. However, empirical studies on these collaborations are still limited. Design/methodology/approach: Building on the above-mentioned theoretical framework, the empirical research was performed in two stages. First, data were collected via a closed-ended questionnaire distributed to all the participants from the sample by e-mail. Second, to assess the hypotheses, structural equation modelling (SEM) via IBM® SPSS® Amos 20 was applied. Findings: The empirical research was conducted on 175 small to medium enterprises in the United Kingdom, suggesting that the knowledge-driven approach is the strongest determinant, leading to a preference for informal inbound OI modes. The findings were obtained using SEM and are discussed in line with the theoretical framework. Research limitations/implications: Owing to the chosen context and sector of the empirical analysis, the research results may lack generalisability. Hence, new studies are proposed. Practical implications: The paper includes implications for the development of informal inbound OI led by knowledge-driven approach. Originality/value: This paper offers an empirical research to investigate knowledge-driven preferences in informal inbound OI modes. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: This paper aims to investigate three key factors (i.e. cognitive dimensions, the knowledge-driven approach and absorptive capacity) that are likely to determine the preference for informal inbound Open Innovation modes, through the lens of the OI model and knowledge-based view (KBV).

Casprini E., De Massis A., Di Minin A., Frattini F., Piccaluga A.;How family firms execute open innovation strategies: the Loccioni case;2017;Purpose: This paper aims to shed light on how family firms execute open innovation strategies by managing internal and external knowledge flows. Design/methodology/approach: First, through a comprehensive literature review, the paper identifies the barriers to the acquisition and transfer of knowledge in open innovation processes. Second, it presents and discusses the results of an exploratory case study on Loccioni, an Italian family firm providing high-tech measurement solutions, highlighting how this family firm managed to overcome the barriers in executing an open innovation strategy. Findings: The case study shows that Loccioni faced specific challenges in acquiring and transferring knowledge in its open innovation processes and developed two idiosyncratic capabilities – labelled imprinting and fraternization – that helped the firm overcome the barriers to knowledge acquisition and transfer. The analysis shows that these two capabilities are enabled by the distinctive goals and social capital characterizing family firms. Originality/value: The paper creates a link between open innovation and family business research with an empirically grounded model illustrating how the idiosyncratic capabilities of a family firm help overcome the critical barriers to the acquisition and transfer of knowledge in executing an open innovation strategy. © 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: This paper aims to shed light on how family firms execute Open Innovation strategies by managing internal and external knowledge flows.

Johnston L., Robinson S., Lockett N.;"Recognising ""open innovation"" in HEI-industry interaction for knowledge transfer and exchange";2010;"Purpose: This paper aims to stimulate debate among academic and policymaking communities as to understanding the importance of social processes and open innovation contexts within existing models of knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) between higher education institutions (HEIs) and industry. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted through a number of case studies connected to UK HEIs and through extensive interviews with representatives of HEI, industry and policy makers over a two-year period. Findings: The results confirm that social processes are often under-explored in collaborative HEI-industry settings. The study identified seven emerging themes which are important to HEI-industry relationships: the importance of network intermediaries; flexibility, openness and connectivity of network structures; encouraging network participation; building trust in relationships through mutual understanding; active network learning; strengthening cooperation through capacity building; and culture change. Practical implications: This research raises implications for policymakers and practitioners engaged in developing KTE collaborative activities. The paper argues for greater attention to be placed upon the social processes that affect collaborative innovation and working. Policymaking in particular needs to take account of these processes as they are neither easy to establish nor sustain. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature on HEI-industry interactions for enhanced KTE activity and partnership working which demonstrates value to wider scholarly and practitioner readership.

Najar T., Dhaouadi K.;Chief Executive Officer's traits and open innovation in small and medium enterprises: the mediating role of innovation climate;2020;"Purpose: This paper aims to study the impact of Chief Executive Officer's (CEO's) personality traits on open innovation (OI) strategies and the mediating effect of innovation climate by mobilizing the upper echelons theory and the OI literature. In fact, CEO's role in OI promotion has been under-investigated in the literature especially in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and in developing economies. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the structural equation modeling, a survey is scheduled by administrating a questionnaire within 178 CEOs in Tunisian high-tech sector. The relevance of the empirical evidences is to disclose human levers to the success of OI strategies in the Tunisian context as a developing country. Findings: The results show the importance of CEO's entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and attitude in promoting innovation climate and so then OI strategies. The study offers a reading grid for managers of high-tech SMEs to better lead and identify key factors for OI adoption. Innovative climate is found to be a relevant driver of OI encompassing the key role of attitude and EO of top managers. Practical implications: Results highlight the relevance of the recruitment of appropriate top managers with high levels of EO and with positive attitude toward OI in order to facilitate OI integration and to enhance SMEs' competitiveness. Entrepreneurially oriented CEOs should be required in order to overcome ""Not Invented Here"" and ""Not Shared Here"" syndromes, to support innovative climate and to encourage knowledge import and export in the Tunisian SMEs. Originality/value: This paper sheds light on the micro-foundation of OI by emphasizing the relevance of human factors and namely EO and attitude of CEOs in OI issue. It provides conceptual and empirical clarification of the extent to which CEO's traits affect OI through innovative climate. This would value initiatives exploring key individual's characteristics influence on OI strategies within SMEs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Purpose: This paper aims to study the impact of Chief Executive Officer's (CEO's) personality traits on Open Innovation strategies and the mediating effect of innovation climate by mobilizing the upper echelons theory and the OI literature.

Lalicic L.;Open innovation platforms in tourism: how do stakeholders engage and reach consensus?;2018;"Purpose: This paper aims to visualize the communication processes between stakeholders who discuss, reach consensus and engage with user-generated ideas through an open innovation platform facilitated by Destination Management Organization (DMO). Design/methodology/approach: Various discussion and interaction styles between the different types of stakeholders on the innovation platform are analyzed using quantitative content analysis. Likewise, perceived issues among the stakeholders that motivate collaboration and consensus are identified. Findings: This paper identifies that stakeholders interact with each other, reach agreements and solve joint problems on the platform by using predominantly constructive interaction styles. Meanwhile, feasibility and strategic issues appear to be the most dominant topics when discussing the fruition of ideas; however, this depends significantly on the category of the idea. Practical implications: DMOs are given an understanding of why and how stakeholders engage with a certain idea and the kind of challenges they perceive when pursuing the execution of an idea. DMOs are advised to carefully design an open innovation platform to facilitate effective online discussions that may lead to working groups. Originality/value: There is a scarcity of approaches in the field of tourism that invite stakeholders to innovate. This study aims to close this gap in tourism research by identifying how and which stakeholders respond to an invitation from a DMO to engage in an open innovation platform and, subsequently, how they interact with other partners to foster collaborative innovation projects in their destination. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.";"Purpose: This paper aims to visualize the communication processes between stakeholders who discuss, reach consensus and engage with user-generated ideas through an Open Innovation platform facilitated by Destination Management Organization (DMO).

Bogers M., Chesbrough H., Strand R.;Sustainable open innovation to address a grand challenge : Lessons from Carlsberg and the Green Fiber Bottle;2020;"Purpose: This paper describes the case of how the Danish beer manufacturer, Carlsberg, developed the Green Fiber Bottle as part of its sustainability program through an open innovation approach in collaboration with complementary partners. It thereby illustrates how a grand challenge associated with sustainability can be effectively addressed through open innovation and reveals the opportunities and challenges that emerge in that context. Design/methodology/approach: The paper summarizes some key elements of the case and, in particular, discusses some of the lessons learned, which can be further explored in future research, practice, and policy. Findings: The case suggests a number of key issues that are relevant when attempting to address grand challenges, in general, and sustainability in the food and beverage (F&B) industry, in particular, namely: leveraging open innovation in the face of sustainability as a grand challenge; sustainability beyond a solid business case; opportunities and challenges in the face of new business models; the importance of early wins for addressing societal challenges for signals and scaling; and the importance of the Nordic context and long-term vision. Originality/value: The case describes a recent (and to some extent still ongoing) initiative of how a particular F&B company has explored new approaches to developing its sustainability program. Therefore, it highlights some of the unique characteristics of this case.

Bahemia H., Squire B., Cousins P.;A multi-dimensional approach for managing open innovation in NPD;2017;Purpose: This paper explores openness within new product development (NPD) projects. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of breadth, depth and partner newness on product innovativeness and product competitive advantage. The authors also seek to examine the contingent effects of the appropriability regime. The authors make suggestions to academics and practitioners based on the findings. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use a structured survey instrument producing an empirical analysis of 205 NPD projects in the manufacturing sector in the UK. The authors use an ordinary least squares regression model to test hypothesised relationships between openness (breadth, depth and partner newness), product innovativeness, product competitive advantage and the appropriability regime. Findings: The authors find that each of the three dimensions of openness, depth, breadth and partner newness, have a significant but differing impact on product innovativeness. Specifically, the study indicates that breadth has a positive effect but only in the presence of a strong appropriability regime, partner newness has a direct positive effect, and depth a direct negative effect. The authors also find that product innovativeness has a positive impact on product competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications: Further research should focus on replicating the findings in other countries, search for further moderating factors, such as the stage of the NPD process, and analyse the longitudinal impact of openness within NPD projects. Practical implications: Organisations are encouraging managers to be more open in their approach to NPD. The authors’ findings suggest that managers need to think about the three dimensions of openness, breadth, depth and partner newness. Their engagement with each of these dimensions depends on the desired outcomes of the innovation project and the strength of patents. Originality/value: The research extends the extant supplier involvement in new product development literature to examine the effect of up to 11 types of external actor in NPD projects. The authors test a new multi-dimensional measurement scale for the openness construct. The authors show that each dimension has a different relationship with product innovativeness. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: This paper explores openness within new product development (NPD) projects.

Rajala R., Westerlund M., Möller K.;Strategic flexibility in open innovation - designing business models for open source software;2012;Purpose: This paper seeks to explore how market orientation facilitates the strategic flexibility of business models grounded in open innovation. The authors suggest that the new paradigm of open innovation may impact a firm's adaptability and responsiveness under conditions of environmental flux. However, extending innovation capacity by opening the innovation process poses major challenges for firms. The aims of this study are to explore the characteristics of open innovation activity and to contemplate the role of strategic flexibility in the design of business models based upon open innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The study draws upon a qualitative research approach through a longitudinal case study in the field of open source software (OSS). The empirical case illustrates how an OSS firm utilizes signals in its environment to flexibly alter its business model. Findings: A business model that embodies open innovation raises dilemmas between open and closed innovation paradigms. However, the authors' case highlights that an ambidextrous approach that combines market orientation with the principles of open innovation increases profitability, shortens time to market through effective market access, and enhances innovation capability. Research limitations/implications: The results have profound implications for industrial marketers, managers, management consultants and business educators. They can use the insights gleaned from this research to guide the development of business models that involve open innovation. The results indicate that firms involved in open innovation need reactive strategic flexibility to cope with the environmental diversity and variability. However, this study analyzes a single case in the field of OSS and one should be cautious when generalizing the findings.

Randhawa K., Josserand E., Schweitzer J., Logue D.;Knowledge collaboration between organizations and online communities: the role of open innovation intermediaries;2017;Purpose: This research paper aims to examine how open innovation (OI) intermediaries facilitate knowledge collaboration between organizations and online user communities. Drawing on a Community of Practice (CoP) perspective on knowledge, the study lays out a framework of the knowledge boundary management mechanisms (and associated practices) that intermediaries deploy in enabling client organizations to engage in online community-based OI. Design/methodology/approach: This research is based on an exploratory case study of an OI intermediary and 18 client organizations that engage with online user communities on the intermediary’s platform. Results incorporate both the intermediary and clients’ perspective, based on analysis of intermediary and client interviews, clients’ online community projects and other archival data. Findings: Results reveal that OI intermediaries deploy three knowledge boundary management mechanisms – syntactic, semantic and pragmatic – each underpinned by a set of practices. Together, these mechanisms enable knowledge transfer, translation and transformation, respectively, and thus lead to cumulatively richer knowledge collaboration outcomes at the organization–community boundary. The findings show that the pragmatic mechanism reinforces both semantic and syntactic mechanisms, and is hence the most critical to achieving effective knowledge collaboration in community-based OI settings. Practical implications: The findings suggest that OI intermediaries have to implement all three boundary management mechanisms to successfully enable knowledge collaboration for community-based OI. More specifically, intermediaries need to expand their focus beyond the development of digital platforms, to include nuanced efforts at building organizational commitment to community engagement. Originality/value: Drawing on the CoP view, this study integrates the knowledge management literature into the OI literature to conceptualize the role of OI intermediaries in shaping knowledge collaboration between organizations and communities. In engaging with the interactive nature of knowledge exchange in such multi-actor settings, this research extends the firm-centric theorization of knowledge that currently dominates the existing OI research. © 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: This research paper aims to examine how Open Innovation intermediaries facilitate knowledge collaboration between organizations and online user communities.

Practical implications: The findings suggest that OI intermediaries have to implement all three boundary management mechanisms to successfully enable knowledge collaboration for community-based OI. More specifically, intermediaries need to expand their focus beyond the development of digital platforms, to include nuanced efforts at building organizational commitment to community engagement. Originality/value: Drawing on the CoP view, this study integrates the knowledge management literature into the OI literature to conceptualize the role of OI intermediaries in shaping knowledge collaboration between organizations and communities. In engaging with the interactive nature of knowledge exchange in such multi-actor settings, this research extends the firm-centric theorization of knowledge that currently dominates the existing OI research. ;10.1108/JKM-09-2016-0423;2-s2.0-85051376709;Australia;Business, Management and Accounting;Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Yun J.J., Jeong E., Yang J.;Open innovation of knowledge cities;2015;"Purpose: This research seeks to answer the basic question, ""As a city evolves from an industrial city to a knowledge one, are its open innovation activities vitalized?"" Design/methodology/approach: In this research, we compare the total number of patent applications, the number of joint applicants of each patent, and the ratio of patents jointly applied, in four Korean cities-Daegu, Kwangju, Cheonann total, top 10 % patent applicants group among total patent applicants, and the lower 70 % patent applicant group among total patent applicants. The research included 144,625 patents submitted to the Korea Patent Office from 1981 to 2010. Findings: As knowledge-based urbanization proceeds, the size of a knowledge city increases. The lowest 70 % of patent applicants (rather than the top 10 %) apply for more patents, and the breadth and depth of open innovation rises. Research limitations/implications (if applicable): This research is limited to mutual patent applications as a target of open innovation. In the future, additional research will need to be conducted on various open innovation channels such as patent citation, intellectual property right transfer, licensing, and M & A. Practical implications (if applicable): To maximize the beneficial characteristics of a knowledge city in a large city, the improvement of open innovation across the city is essential. Social implications (if applicable): If strengthening open innovation by SMEs or start-ups is set as a corporate strategy or a government policy, it will be a source of development of knowledge-based urbanization and continued economic development of a knowledge city, as well as of the total knowledge assets. © 2015 Yun et al.";"Purpose: This research seeks to answer the basic question, ""As a city evolves from an industrial city to a knowledge one, are its Open Innovation activities vitalized?""

Han S., Lyu Y., Ji R., Zhu Y., Su J., Bao L.;Open innovation, network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability;2020;Purpose: This study aims at developing a better understanding of the relationship between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability and further examines the moderating effect of open innovation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts hierarchical regressions to validate the theoretical model and collect the patent data of the top 54 firm patentees in the smartphone industry as empirical sample. Using patent citation network data, this paper estimates the relationship between open innovation, network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. Findings: This paper empirically shows that structural embeddedness exerts a negative effect on incremental innovation capability, while relational embeddedness is positively related to incremental innovation capability. And open innovation strengthens the relationship between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. Originality/value: This paper shifts the focus of the determinants of incremental innovation capability from internal factors to the external network features by exploring the linkage between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. A counterintuitive conclusion is that structural embeddedness shows a negative effect on firm's incremental innovation capability. Furthermore, in contrast to most previous studies, which only focus on the direct effect of open innovation on the firm's incremental innovation capability, our study examines the moderating effect of open innovation on the relationships between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. At last, the results provide practical guidance for firms to occupy the beneficial network positions and adopt appropriate open innovation strategies to improve their incremental innovation capability. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: This study aims at developing a better understanding of the relationship between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability and further examines the moderating effect of Open Innovation.

Liao S., Fu L., Liu Z.;Investigating open innovation strategies and firm performance: the moderating role of technological capability and market information management capability;2020;Purpose: This study aims to assess how firm functional capability moderates the relationship between two types of open innovation and performance, with a special focus on the role of technological capability and the join effect market information management capability. This paper develops and tests a research model, which assesses how the performance implications of two open innovation forms are shaped by the technological capability and how such an effect is contingent on market information management capability. Design/methodology/approach: Survey data were collected from 238 Chinese high-tech enterprises. Structural equation modeling and linear regression were used to test the data. Then, the main research questions were answered. Findings: Empirically results show that technological capability strengthens the influence of inbound open innovation on firm performance. However, the moderate effect of technological capability on the relationship between outbound open innovation and firm performance remains unsupported. A higher technological capability with a high level of market information management capability increases the efficacy of outbound open innovation in gaining superior performance. Additional analysis shows that when firms implement inbound activities and possess a strong technological capability, they will achieve higher performance if they possess a moderate level of market information management capability, compared with a high or low level. Originality/value: This paper provides new evidence on the benefits of different open innovation strategies on firm’s performance and, more importantly, the specific firm-level contingencies (technological capability and market information management capability) under which these benefits are more likely to be enhanced. It clarifies what the capabilities are and how they interact to foster the robust open innovation strategies, which sheds new light on the boundary conditions that affect the open innovations–firm performance relationship. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: This study aims to assess how firm functional capability moderates the relationship between two types of Open Innovation and performance, with a special focus on the role of technological capability and the join effect market information management capability.

Drawing from the absorptive capacity perspective, organizational inertia theory, and open innovation, the authors seek to argue that dynamic innovation capabilities have a curvilinear effect on breakthrough innovation that is moderated by open innovation activities. Design/methodology/approach: A mail survey was sent to the top 1,000 firms in Taiwan, the target respondents being senior managers with experience in developing at least three successful breakthrough innovations in the past five years. A total of 218 usable questionnaires were collected, resulting in a respondent rate of 22.9 percent. Findings: The findings support the argument that dynamic innovation capabilities have an inverted U-shape relationship with breakthrough innovation. Meanwhile, open innovation activities strengthen the positive effects of dynamic innovation capabilities on breakthrough innovation. Research limitations/implications: The findings enrich the existing literature by proposing and confirming empirically that open innovation activities help firms with effective coordination of dynamic innovation capabilities. Practical implications: Managers must be aware of the limitations of their existing dynamic innovation capabilities in terms of developing breakthrough innovation. Originality/value: This study not only resolves the conflicting views about the relationship between dynamic capabilities and innovation but also adds to the existing literature that indicates the failure of leading firms in the face of rapid environmental change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.;Purpose: This study aims to examine the roles of dynamic innovation capabilities and Open Innovation activities in breakthrough innovation.

Roldán Bravo M.I., Lloréns Montes F.J., Ruiz Moreno A.;Open innovation in supply networks: an expectation disconfirmation theory perspective;2017;Purpose: This study aims to use expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT) to investigate how an organization’s satisfaction with its supply network’s behavior influences its intention to open innovation with that network. This paper proposes that an organization’s orientation to open innovation is influenced by confirmation of previously held expectations of trust and commitment and level of perceived procedural justice in its open innovation partner. This paper also examines the effect of this orientation on the organization’s supply chain competence. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from a survey of 286 European firms, the study proposes and evaluates a structural equation model. Findings: The results show that a positive disconfirmation of trust (where perceived trust exceeds expectations) plays a crucial role in shaping organizations’ intentions to continue open innovation with their supply networks. These results show that disconfirmation is a good predictor of overall satisfaction with open innovation. This paper also confirms the positive effect of orientation to open innovation on supply chain competence. Finally, this paper obtained evidence for the positive effect of supply chain competence on firm performance. Originality/value: This study shows the importance of managing expectations in open innovation under the EDT. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous research has analyzed the consistency between the trust and commitment an organization expects from its open innovation partner and the trust and commitment it ultimately perceives as a factor explaining its degree of orientation to open innovation. Therefore, this research contributes to a better understanding of open innovation enablers and also its consequences. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.;Purpose: This study aims to use expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT) to investigate how an organization’s satisfaction with its supply network’s behavior influences its intention to Open Innovation with that network.

Grama-Vigouroux S., Saidi S., Berthinier-Poncet A., Vanhaverbeke W., Madanamoothoo A.;From closed to open: A comparative stakeholder approach for developing open innovation activities in SMEs;2020;Recent literature on open innovation (OI) highlights the need for studies regarding the factors that influence firms to switch from a closed to an OI strategy. At the same time, stakeholder literature points out the scarcity of knowledge regarding antecedent factors fostering collaboration with the firm's stakeholders and their engagement for higher value creation. To fill these gaps, we propose an analytical framework for implementing a strategic OI process through the development of stakeholder engagement. Our framework comprises 17 factors grouped in five levers: knowledge, collaboration, organizational, strategic, and financial. We empirically applied this framework to two industrial SMEs. A qualitative study was conducted based on semi-structured interviews with internal and external stakeholders of both firms. The results show that one company successfully implemented the OI process, while the other struggled to evolve from a traditionally closed innovation model to a more open model. Analyzing the results, we identified several aspects that could explain this difference. These aspects concern the OI activities performed by both firms, the combination of the five levers into a coherent OI approach, stakeholder engagement, and the characteristics of the CEOs. The current study contributes insights for theory and practice, especially as it proposes an original framework for developing a strategic OI process that integrates a stakeholder approach. © 2019;Recent literature on Open Innovation highlights the need for studies regarding the factors that influence firms to switch from a closed to an OI strategy.

Zhu X., Xiao Z., Dong M.C., Gu J.;The fit between firms’ open innovation and business model for new product development speed: A contingent perspective;2019;Recent studies suggest that the effectiveness of open innovation (OI) can significantly differ among firms. One possible reason is the different ways of implementing OI strategies. Another is the ignorance of the explicit role of business model (BM). In this study, we integrate the two plausible explanations by exploring the impact of the interplay between different OI implementations and BM on firms’ new product development (NPD) speed. Empirical results from a survey of 265 Chinese firms show that both OI breadth and OI depth positively affect NPD speed. More importantly, we find that an efficient BM strengthens the positive effect of OI depth while it weakens the positive effect of OI breadth. We also find that a novel BM strengthens the positive effect of OI breadth while it weakens the positive effect of OI depth. This research contributes to OI literature by underscoring the importance of matching the BMs to the OI strategies to facilitate NPD. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd;Recent studies suggest that the effectiveness of Open Innovation can significantly differ among firms.

In this respect, the innovation competency of design consulting firms is unprecedentedly regarded as a deciding competitive edge. This study examines the effects of design innovation competencies as personal innovation competency, organizational innovation competency, and technological innovation competency on the competitiveness of the design outsourcing service in meditating design innovativeness. Data were collected through a survey conducted among 392 design consulting enterprises by way of random sampling over seven regions in Korea. As a result of hypothesis verification, it turned out that the personal innovation competency of designers at design consulting enterprises and technological innovation competency, which represents their design methods and skills, had significant effects on design innovativeness. In contrast, organizational innovation competency showed no significant effects on design innovativeness. For a design consulting enterprise to become an innovative one with better outsourcing service competitiveness, it needs to pursue a strategic direction of strengthening designers' personal innovation and technological design innovation. © 2020 by the authors.;Recently many enterprises have been in need of design outsourcing services through which they can form creative ideas and innovations.

As a result of hypothesis verification, it turned out that the personal innovation competency of designers at design consulting enterprises and technological innovation competency, which represents their design methods and skills, had significant effects on design innovativeness. In contrast, organizational innovation competency showed no significant effects on design innovativeness. For a design consulting enterprise to become an innovative one with better outsourcing service competitiveness, it needs to pursue a strategic direction of strengthening designers' personal innovation and technological design innovation. ;10.3390/JOITMC6020036;2-s2.0-85085645977;South Korea;"Economics, Econometrics and Finance; Social Sciences";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Battistella C., Nonino F.;Exploring the impact of motivations on the attraction of innovation roles in open innovation web-based platforms;2013;Recently, a large number of new innovative enterprises engaged in different competitive markets by promoting innovation both in products and in services through open innovation web-based platforms, which allow for the collaboration of individual users and companies and for so-called crowdsourcing. A key issue concerns the identification of the most important motivations that could attract users with a specific role to proactively participate and contribute to the open and collaborative innovation processes. This article, after highlighting the theoretical background, grounded on large body of psychology and sociology literature on the motivation behind collaboration, discusses the results of the analysis of 26 open innovation web-based platforms based on a multiple research methodology (qualitative empirical study, factor analysis and multi-dimensional scaling). It also discusses the effects of motivational systems and platform models on the attraction of the individuals characterised by different innovation roles. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;Recently, a large number of new innovative enterprises engaged in different competitive markets by promoting innovation both in products and in services through Open Innovation web-based platforms, which allow for the collaboration of individual users and companies and for so-called crowdsourcing.

Battistella C., De Toni A.F., Pessot E.;Framing open innovation in start-ups' incubators: A complexity theory perspective;2018;Recently, concepts and principles from the Complexity Theory (or, generally speaking, the complexity sciences) have been applied as a perspective for capturing the influence of the context, interaction, and adaption in the innovation processes, such as the ones enabled in the business incubators. The purpose of this paper is to implement a frame of reference for understanding the start-ups' incubator as a complex system where innovation, learning, and self-organization take place. We build on the interfaces between the Complexity Theory (i.e., complexity sciences) and Open Innovation literature to identify principles, patterns, and conditions that frame the incubation practices as simple rules aimed to sustain the innovation process towards the creation of new ventures. Results from the multiple case studies conducted in five incubators show that the features of variety, nonlinear interaction, interdependence, autonomy, and emergence of the incubation process framed as a complex system are enabled in different ways by the combination of the open innovation practices and services provided by the start-ups' incubators, including the provision of physical infrastructure, access to funding streams, experts/entrepreneurs networking, education/workshops, mentorship, and advice. © 2018 by the authors.;Recently, concepts and principles from the Complexity Theory (or, generally speaking, the complexity sciences) have been applied as a perspective for capturing the influence of the context, interaction, and adaption in the innovation processes, such as the ones enabled in the business incubators.

Ilyas A., Khan A.H., Zaid F., Ali M., Razzaq A., Khan W.A.;Turnover intention of employees, supervisor support, and open innovation: The role of illegitimate tasks;2020;Recently, the small and micro enterprises have earned significant fame in the management and entrepreneurship discipline. Researchers have examined the turnover intention of employees working within formal organizations, but ignored the employees working within small and micro enterprises. The aim of this study is to analyze the moderating effects of supervisor support on the relationship between illegitimate tasks and turnover intention of the employees of small and micro enterprises. An interview-administered questionnaire approach was used for data collection, and the snowball sampling technique was employed in this study to contact employees who were working within small and micro enterprises. The sample size was 420 employees from Lahore city (the provincial capital city of Punjab, Pakistan). Results showed that supervisor support would moderate the impact of illegitimate tasks on turnover intention, and a high level of support available from supervisor to the employee at the workplace would make them less likely to leave the organization as opposed to an employee who has less supervisor support at the workplace. The study reveals that supervisor support in small and micro enterprises is necessary to reduce or eliminate stress in the environment. Consequently, this study implies that the managers and supervisors of small and micro enterprises should provide logic and explanation to their subordinates and motivate their subordinates as to why they are assigned that particular task instead of any other employee and how important it is. This study contributes to the field of small and micro enterprises by evaluating the relationship between illegitimate tasks and turnover intention. This study is unique because management scholars have more often studied employees’ behavior in large corporations rather than in small and micro enterprises. © 2020 by the authors.

Oakey R.P.;Open innovation and its relevance to industrial research and development: The case of high-technology small firms;2013;Recently, there has been increasing interest in the principle of open innovation and its relevance to our understanding of innovation in modern industry. This article relates these ideas to the specific, yet important, case of innovation in high-technology small firms (HTSFs). HTSFs are of interest since they have produced a significant number of the most important innovations in the high-technology sectors over the past 30 years. Certainly as far as HTSFs are concerned, it is argued that the ideas behind greater openness during innovation are not well suited to the way in which this type of firm innovates. Moreover, it is argued more generally that the work of Chesbrough can be criticised for overstating the potential for greater openness in terms of industrial research and development, since a degree of openness has always existed, while simultaneously understating the merits of closed innovation systems. © The Author(s) 2012.;Recently, there has been increasing interest in the principle of Open Innovation and its relevance to our understanding of innovation in modern industry.

They help to connect innovation system actors to foster industrial innovation. Due to this intermediary role, they act as paradigmatic open innovation (OI) actors. In this context, RTOs need to balance their knowledge stocks and flows, while assuring their own innovation capabilities and positively impacting the innovation system they influence. Thus, RTOs need to develop collaboration approaches that support their own performance while increasing their capabilities and not threatening their competitive advantages derived from their knowledge stock. In this study we extend the OI research to research organisations analysing their OI approach and the impact on its own performance, developing a new framework for OI study in RTOs using a partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. The research, based on a sample of Spanish RTOs, arises two substantive conclusions. First, an increased number of collaboration partners (collaboration breadth) and the use of a variety of OI practices have a strong impact on RTOs' overall performance (scientific, transference, and economic results). Second, RTOs need to foster their aperture and promote an active management to benefit from collaborating partners, whereas managers should pay special attention to questions related to the protection and management of intellectual property when promoting the use of dierent OI practices.

Fichter K.;Innovation communities: The role of networks of promotors in open innovation;2009;Research on Open Innovation has increasingly emphasised the role of communities in creating, shaping and disseminating innovations. However, the comparability of many studies has been hampered by the lack of a precise definition of the community construct, and the research on Open Innovation has to date not been well connected to insights from research on the role of transformational leaders and the networking of champions and promotors across organisational boundaries. For this reason, this paper introduces a new construct of 'innovation communities' based on promotor theory, which it defines as 'networks of promotors'. It proposes a comprehensive concept of the quality of interaction in innovation communities, and presents findings of three case studies, which explore the role of promotors and networks of promotors in Open Innovation. The case studies reveal that such transformational leaders as promotors, and especially their close and informal co-operation across functional and organisational boundaries, play a key role in Open Innovation. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Research on Open Innovation has increasingly emphasised the role of communities in creating, shaping and disseminating innovations.

Slavec Gomezel A., Rangus K.;Open innovation: it starts with the leader’s openness;2019;Research on open innovation mostly focuses on company level aspects of this phenomenon and predominantly investigates open innovation in large firms. Individuals and especially leaders play a vital role in the successful implementation of open innovation. However, research on this important issue has only recently begun to flourish, with research showing the vast occurence of open innovation activities among small and medium-sized companies and the vital role entrepreneurs play for open innovation. In this research, we connect the fields of open innovation and entrepreneurship and employ dynamics capability literature to focus on factors on the individual level (entrepreneurs’ openness and network closeness), which affect innovation performance and strategic growth intentions of companies through absorptive capacity. We conceptualise a theoretical model and test it on entrepreneurs samples from two countries (Slovenia and United States) by means of structural equation modelling. The results suggest that entrepreneurial openness is an important antecedent of absorptive capacity and that too much focus on maintaining the same business contacts (network closeness) prevents the company from absorbing trends from outside the company and network. We also show that absorptive capacity is positively related to innovation performance and strategic growth intentions. We discuss the implications for theory and practice. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;Research on Open Innovation mostly focuses on company level aspects of this phenomenon and predominantly investigates Open Innovation in large firms.

In particular, it examines the effect of collaborations with competitors (i.e. coopetition) on the organizational performance of clubs via both use of outside knowledge and the adoption of new services, processes, and business models (i.e. organizational-level innovations). Research methods: A statewide online survey with 292 members of the board of directors of nonprofit sports clubs was conducted in Germany (Saarland). The survey used valid and reliable scales and considered self-reported financial stability and membership development as organizational performance indicators. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the mediation model. Results and findings: The proposed coopetition-based open innovation model has a good model fit. Engagement in coopetition has a positive effect on organizational performance via two sequential mediators: use of outside knowledge and innovation implementation. In addition, use of outside knowledge has a direct positive effect on organizational performance. Implications: Nonprofit sports clubs should take advantage of collaborations with competitors and exploit external knowledge to the best of their abilities.

Eckhardt J.T., Ciuchta M.P., Carpenter M.;Open innovation, information, and entrepreneurship within platform ecosystems;2018;Research Summary: Companies sponsor platform ecosystems as an open innovation strategy to encourage complementors to develop complementary products, services, or technologies that can add value to the platform ecosystem. In this study, we develop and test an information-based theory of entrepreneurial activity within platform ecosystems. We postulate that ecosystems produce different types of information—a subset of which will foster entrepreneurship in the form of the commercialization of complementary products that were previously released for free. Our results indicate that product-specific information is associated with commercialization, but we fail to detect a relationship between market information and subsequent commercialization activity. Managerial Summary: The digital economy has led to a proliferation of platform ecosystems that harness external innovation. These ecosystems rely on complementors who enhance the value of platforms by creating complementary technologies. Hence, complementors' commercial viability is important. One such type of ecosystem is an app store, which enables complementors to introduce software that improves the platform product. App stores exist for a variety of software platforms, ranging from mobile phone operating systems (iOS and Android) to electronic medical record systems (Epic and Cerner). In this research, we find that complementors who introduce a free version of a mobile app are more likely to commercialize their app in response to specific types of information and platform designers should manage information in their platforms to foster platform viability. © 2018 Strategic Management Society;Research Summary: Companies sponsor platform ecosystems as an Open Innovation strategy to encourage complementors to develop complementary products, services, or technologies that can add value to the platform ecosystem.

Open innovation involves a shift toward more open and distributed models of innovation, while platformization refers to the increasing importance of digital platforms as a venue for value creation and capture. Together, open innovation and platforms have created numerous opportunities for entrepreneurs and their firms—from serving as inputs for innovation for established firms to participating as complementors on existing platforms. While these entrepreneurial opportunities (and conditions) have manifested themselves in rich and varied ways, our understanding of these new forms of entrepreneurship has lagged behind. In this essay, and in this special issue, our objective is to bring a sharper focus on the important research issues and questions that frame open innovation, platforms, and entrepreneurship. Managerial Summary: Digital platforms and open innovation environments have unleashed numerous promising opportunities for entrepreneurs, in industries ranging from consumer software, entertainment, and home appliances to auto, health, and energy. To pursue those opportunities, however, entrepreneurs will need to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that facilitate and constrain them. In this essay, we identify and discuss several of these factors and the associated challenges and highlight the need for additional research. We also consider some of the broader contextual factors, including regulatory policies, digitization, and globalization that shape the emerging opportunities. © 2018 Strategic Management Society;Research Summary: In recent decades, two emergent phenomena have jointly transformed the nature and pursuit of entrepreneurship across industries and sectors: Open Innovation and platformization.

Greul A., West J., Bock S.;Open at birth? Why new firms do (or don’t) use open innovation;2018;Research Summary: Open innovation is about firms harnessing knowledge flows across firm boundaries, but limited research has examined the nature and antecedents of these flows for start-up firms, as well as the interdependence of inbound and outbound flows. From a new sample of start-up firms making 3D printers, we show how their degree of openness for inbound and outbound knowledge flows relates to the firms’ initial capabilities and founding intentions. From this, we suggest that the patterns of openness are influenced more by initial factor endowments than a firm-specific process of emergent strategy development. Managerial Summary: Innovative firms often face trade-offs between open and proprietary strategies, particularly in industries and segments where online communities and other collaborations provide a pool of shared knowledge for the entire industry. This study illuminates these trade-offs by comparing the choices made by the founders of 3D printer manufacturers. For products based on modular systems, it shows the range of choices that firms have on their degree of inbound openness (using external technology) and outbound openness (sharing their own technology)—as well as the interdependencies of these choices. Finally, it points to long-term implications of early entrepreneurial decisions: firms that leverage external technology can enter markets more quickly, but their innovation options will be limited unless they have capabilities for proprietary innovation.

Hung K.-P., Chou C.;The impact of open innovation on firm performance: The moderating effects of internal R&D and environmental turbulence;2013;Researchers have identified open innovation as two dimensions, external technology acquisition and external technology exploitation. This study explores the direct and interactive effects of these two dimensions on firm performance and further examines the moderation effects of two factors (i.e., internal R&D and environmental turbulence) on the relationship between both types of open innovation and firm performance. Based on Chesbrough's open innovation model, multi-item scales were developed to measure two dimensions of firm-level open innovation. Survey results of 176 Taiwanese high tech manufacturing firms provide support for most hypotheses. The result shows that external technology acquisition positively affects firm performance, whereas external technology exploitation does not. This study also finds that external technology acquisition strengthens the relationship between external technology exploitation and firm performance. Both external technology acquisition and external technology exploitation are positively related to firm performance under high internal R&D investment and a turbulent market environment. However, technological turbulence only positively affects the relationship between external technological acquisition, but not external technology exploitation, and firm performance. The findings contribute to enhanced understanding of how the degree of leveraging open innovation dimensions depends on their complementarity, internal R&D, and environmental turbulence. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Zhu X., Dong M.C., Gu J., Dou W.;How Do Informal Ties Drive Open Innovation? the Contingency Role of Market Dynamism;2017;Scholars and practitioners have recently shifted their attention from traditional closed internal innovation to open innovation (OI). Building on both the resource-based view and the network perspective, we explore the roles of three types of informal ties (i.e., business, government, and university) in driving inbound and outbound OI, and further examine such effects contingent on market dynamism. Empirical results from our study of 260 Chinese firms show that all three types of informal ties positively affect inbound innovation openness, whereas only business ties facilitate outbound innovation openness. In addition, market dynamism strengthens the relationship between university ties and inbound innovation openness, but weakens the effect of business ties on inbound innovation openness. These findings indicate the salience of informal ties in increasing innovation openness and the contingent role of external market conditions. The findings contribute to the understanding of the drivers of innovation openness, and help clarify the differences between inbound and outbound OI. © 2017 IEEE.;Scholars and practitioners have recently shifted their attention from traditional closed internal innovation to Open Innovation.

Radnejad A.B., Vredenburg H., Woiceshyn J.;Meta-organizing for open innovation under environmental and social pressures in the oil industry;2017;Scholars have yet to address why and how open innovation model can be applied effectively within industries while diminishing its potential cost and challenges. In this paper, we extend open innovation model both theoretically and practically by identifying a) the boundary conditions that motivate firms within resource-based industries to apply the model and b) the approaches that have been implemented in practice in applying the model. In this multiple-case study, we explore why and how firms within the upstream Canadian oil industry have evolved to apply open innovation model over time to deal with the industry's challenges. First, our findings show that institutional forces, both normative and coercive—such as social and environmental pressures, were the primary drivers for adopting open innovation. Second, by building on the taxonomy of meta-organizations, we demonstrate that an industry-founded and not-for-profit innovation intermediary, as a meta-organization, is a necessary tool to address problems of adopting open innovation. We argue that the experiments of the upstream oil industry to develop a suitable organizational design for such innovation intermediaries suggest that a moderate level of stratification accompanying either close or open membership is the most suitable design. The findings from this study can be helpful to other industries, particularly other resource- based industries, which seek to effectively employ the open innovation model through innovation intermediaries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;Scholars have yet to address why and how Open Innovation model can be applied effectively within industries while diminishing its potential cost and challenges.

Helm R., Endres H., Hüsig S.;When and how often to externally commercialize technologies? a critical review of outbound open innovation;2019;Since the 1990s, external technology commercialization (ETC) has become increasingly relevant in business management practice and the academic literature. Frequently, ETC is praised as highly important and is often even considered an important competence of a progressive firm. To date, research has mainly focused on the opportunities and advantages of ETC, while risks and costs tend to be ignored or downplayed. This paper aims to review ETC critically. We stress that ETC might not only cause operating costs but also requires additional human resources. From a strategic perspective, we propose that ETC may result in the loss of competitive advantages through the disclosure of internal knowledge (or areas the firm is working in) or through the suboptimal allocation of R&D resources, and thereby affects a firm’s performance negatively. Finally, we propose specific implications for management and research on when and how often companies should practice ETC, and illustrate related practical experience by a case study. We thereby propose an inversely U-shaped relationship between ETC’s intensity and the firm’s profit contribution. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.;Since the 1990s, external technology commercialization (ETC) has become increasingly relevant in business management practice and the academic literature.

Radziwon A., Bogers M.;Open innovation in SMEs: Exploring inter-organizational relationships in an ecosystem;2019;Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face the inherent tension of depending on external partners to complement their internal innovation activities while having limited resources to manage such open innovation processes. Given the importance of collaborative efforts between multiple stakeholders, we address the open innovation challenges from the SME perspective at the business-ecosystem level. We present an inductive case study of a particular regional ecosystem and focus on the inter-organizational collaboration between SMEs and other stakeholders in the ecosystem. With this focus, we explore how SMEs perceive, organize, and manage open innovation through strong collaborative ties with other ecosystem members.

Specific findings include the link between innovation type expressed by diverging understandings of the notion of innovation across the ecosystem and the innovation form (here, open innovation), which should be organized and managed on multiple levels of analysis (SME, inter-organizational, and ecosystem). These findings highlight specific attention points for managing and developing open innovation in a regional business ecosystem, and they contribute both to the business-ecosystem literature as well as open innovation literature. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face the inherent tension of depending on external partners to complement their internal innovation activities while having limited resources to manage such Open Innovation processes. Given the importance of collaborative efforts between multiple stakeholders, we address the Open Innovation challenges from the SME perspective at the business-ecosystem level. We present an inductive case study of a particular regional ecosystem and focus on the inter-organizational collaboration between SMEs and other stakeholders in the ecosystem. With this focus, we explore how SMEs perceive, organize, and manage Open Innovation through strong collaborative ties with other ecosystem members.

Gama F., Frishammar J., Parida V.;Idea generation and open innovation in SMEs: When does market-based collaboration pay off most?;2019;Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) largely depend on proficient idea generation activities to improve their front-end innovation performance, yet the liabilities of newness and smallness often hamper SMEs' ability to benefit from systematic idea generation. To compensate for these liabilities, many SMEs adopt an open innovation approach by collaborating with market-based partners such as customers and suppliers. This study investigates the relationship between SMEs' systematic idea generation and front-end performance and investigates the moderating role of market-based partnership for SMEs. Drawing on a survey of 146 Swedish manufacturing SMEs, this study provides two key contributions. First, the systematic idea generation and front-end performance relationship in SMEs is non-linear. Accordingly, higher levels of front-end performance are achieved when idea generation activities are highly systematic. Second, the returns from higher levels of systematic idea generation are positively moderated by market-based partnerships. Thus, external cooperation with customers and suppliers pays off most toward front-end performance when SMEs have highly systematic idea generation processes. These results indicate a contingency perspective on the role of external partnerships. They also have implications for research into the front-end of innovation and open innovation in the context of SMEs. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) largely depend on proficient idea generation activities to improve their front-end innovation performance, yet the liabilities of newness and smallness often hamper SMEs' ability to benefit from systematic idea generation.

Pedersen K.;What can open innovation be used for and how does it create value?;2020;Societies face difficult challenges which require responses that go beyond the innovation capability of most public sector organisations. Open approaches to public sector innovation that exploits digital technologies have been proposed for some years to close this gap, but our knowledge of the use and outcome of using open innovation in this context is limited. This research takes stock of the study and use of these approaches by investigating the purposes for which public sector organisations use open innovation, and how it creates value. The research question is answered through a systematic literature review and an analysis of publicly available data about the open innovation projects referred to in that literature. The research identifies five different purposes of using open innovation. It also suggests that public sector organisations primarily use open innovation to pursue one specific purpose: innovation in society. When using open innovation for this purpose, public sector organisations attempt to create value by improving citizens' quality of life and the quality of neighbourhoods. They do this primarily by co-specialising IT and other resources in society (e.g. the transportation system) and by using the outcome of this co-specialisation process to change citizen behaviour, capabilities and experiences (e.g. encouraging citizens to use the transportation system more efficiently or making citizens feel more safe when using the transportation system). This research indicates that open innovation is generally not used to open up public sector organisations or to give citizens more influence in public sector or democratic processes. The research also indicates that open innovation, until now, has primarily been used to solve minor problems, and not large scale wicked problems in society. The research suggests a framework for value creation from open innovation initiatives that pursues innovation in society. This framework might help public sector organisations increase value creation and solve wicked problems using open innovation, and might help researchers to focus future open innovation research on essential knowledge gaps. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.;Societies face difficult challenges which require responses that go beyond the innovation capability of most public sector organisations.

In this explorative study, we provide new empirical evidence to the innovation speed literature. We examine to what extent innovation speed is affected by organisational, technological, and relational contingencies that preoccupy firms with open innovation practices. Taking the firm perspective, we track innovation timeline and emphasise the complex trade-offs that firms encounter while innovating. Our results show that many of the contingencies, emphasised by the literature promoting innovation, could slow down its speed.

The innovation literature (particularly the open innovation stream) extensively investigates and is able to provide us with businesses’ capabilities for integrating external actors for conventional innovation projects. Elaborated from the literature, we identify and conceptualize four capabilities as bundles of open conventional innovation capability – namely, networking, competence mapping, relational, and desorptive capabilities. Starting from the conceptual framework of open conventional innovation capabilities, eight innovation projects aimed particularly at sustainability with diverse and broad actors were used as an empirical context for qualitative, multiple-case studies. The results suggest that open sustainability-oriented innovation capabilities conform to the open conventional innovation capability framework; however, the capabilities must be reconciled with the particular sustainability context. In particular, the results suggest that desorptive capability (the ability of aligning/empowering internals for external acquirements) requires particular and strong reconciliation with the sustainability context, whereas the required reconciliation of networking, competence mapping and relational capabilities strongly depends on the outcome characteristics.

Du S., Yalcinkaya G., Bstieler L.;Sustainability, Social Media Driven Open Innovation, and New Product Development Performance*;2016;Sustainability and social media use in open innovation play important roles in a firm's new product development (NPD) process. This research examines, in conjunction, the roles of sustainability and social media driven inbound open innovation (SMOI) for a firm's NPD performance, and further, takes a more refined approach by differentiating between different types of SMOI activities. To this end, this research develops and tests a conceptual framework, which predicts that (1) a firm's sustainability orientation (SO) is positively associated with its NPD performance, (2) customer focus (CF) partially mediates the SO–NPD performance link, and (3) particular SMOI activities moderate the CF–NPD performance link. The empirical results, using data from the Product Development and Management Association (PDMA)'s comparative performance assessment study, provide support for most of the framework. Notably, this research documents a positive link between SO and NPD performance, as well as a partial mediating role of CF. The results further suggest that social media driven open innovation activities focused on gathering market insights enhance CF directly, while social media driven open innovation activities that garner technical expertise enhance the link between CF and NPD performance. This paper bridges the separate literatures on sustainability and open innovation, and contributes to the NPD research. The findings suggest that managers should take a strategic approach to sustainability and embed it in the NPD process. Furthermore, managers should manage social media based open innovation carefully to fully benefit the firm during the front end and back end of NPD. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association;Sustainability and social media use in Open Innovation play important roles in a firm's new product development (NPD) process.

Our simulation research allows for modelling the micro-foundations of open innovation and for studying innovation strategies in different market conditions. We find that the relative financial payoffs associated with the different innovation strategies vary over time: some strategies win out in the short-term, others in the long-term. Our results also suggest that a focused closed innovation strategy can lead to higher financial performance when all the resources are concentrated on internal R&D and commercialisation.

Hence, industry is engaged in an accelerated automation race where industrial automation converts value chains into intelligent, data-driven systems. This generates new business models and spurs firm competitiveness in general. Companies thus pay attention to the development, acquisition, and incorporation of related technologies to profit from these developments in specific. For this, they must incorporate external flows of knowledge to succeed in innovation. Yet, there is a dearth of research that links open innovation to the incorporation of industrial automation, and to firm performance. Hence, this paper takes a knowledge-based view of the firm and sheds light on the moderating role of the processes of open innovation on the economic results of firms’ subject to automation. In order to do so, we estimate the impact of the interaction of open innovation and automation on firm turnover using panel data for 5287 Spanish firms from a variety of manufacture and service industries. We separate the effects for different open-innovation partners and find that turnover is increased for those automating firms that engage in open innovation with suppliers. These results indicate that suppliers possess the knowledge required for successful automation, and firms that innovate together with suppliers fare better at leveraging investments in automation.

Shabanov V.L., Vasilchenko M.Y., Derunova E.A., Potapov A.P.;Formation of an export-oriented agricultural economy and regional open innovations;2021;The aim of the work is to find relevant indicators for assessing the relationship between investments in fixed assets in agriculture, gross output of the industry, and agricultural exports using tools for modeling the impact of innovation and investment development on increasing production and export potential in the context of the formation of an export-oriented agricultural economy. The modeling methodology and the proposed estimating and forecasting tools for diagnosing and monitoring the state of sectoral and regional innovative agricultural systems are used to analyze the relationship between investments in fixed assets in agriculture, gross output of the industry, and agricultural exports based on the construction of the classification of Russian regions by factors that aggregate these features to diagnose incongruence problems and to improve institutional management in regional innovative export-oriented agrosystems.

Herstad S.J., Bloch C., Ebersberger B., van de Velde E.;National innovation policy and global open innovation: Exploring balances, tradeoffs and complementarities;2010;"The aim of this article is to suggest a framework for examining the way national policy mixes are responding to the challenges and opportunities of globally distributed knowledge networks, cross-sectoral technology flows and consequently open innovation processes occurring on an international scale. We argue that the purpose of public research and innovation policy remains one of developing and sustaining territorial knowledge bases capable of growing and supporting internationally competitive industries. But the rules of the game have changed. Public policy now needs to carefully balance between: a) promoting the formation of international linkages for knowledge sourcing and information exposure; b) providing incentives for domestic industry intramural R&D for building absorptive capacity and knowledge accumulation; and c) sustaining domestic networking to allow accumulated knowledge to diffuse and recombine. © Beech Tree Publishing 2010.";"The aim of this article is to suggest a framework for examining the way national policy mixes are responding to the challenges and opportunities of globally distributed knowledge networks, cross-sectoral technology flows and consequently Open Innovation processes occurring on an international scale.

Filiou D.;A new perspective on open innovation: established and new technology firms in UK bio-pharmaceuticals;2021;The aim of this paper is to explore open innovation (OI) implementation and its impact on firm innovation performance in sectors experiencing technological discontinuities. The paper employs the framework of inbound, outbound and coupled OI to identify processes reflecting sourcing, externalising and exchanging knowledge across organisational boundaries on upstream and downstream innovation activities and explores their impact on the innovation performance of new and established technology firms. The empirical setting is the UK bio-pharmaceuticals sector during 1991 and 2001, a paradigmatic era of discontinous change and intensified OI implementation. First, our findings show that new technology firms (NTFs) and established technology firms (ETFs) differ in their extent and patterns of inbound, outbound and coupled OI, reflecting that they implement OI to manage their competences in light of technological change. Second, we identify a complex and multifaceted relationship between OI and patenting performance, with NTFs experiencing enhanced performance from some OI processes while ETFs experiencing challenges. The paper suggests that delineating OI into inbound, outbound and coupled, along upstream and downstream activities, offers a deeper understanding of the role of OI in innovation, guiding selective implementation in pursuing enhanced innovation performance during periods of discontinuous technological change. © 2020 The Authors.

Carmona-Lavado A., Cuevas-Rodríguez G., Cabello-Medina C., Fedriani E.M.;Does open innovation always work? The role of complementary assets;2021;The aim of this research is twofold: first, to identify Open Innovation (OI) configurations, and second, to analyze which configurations are associated with a high, and which with a low, OI performance. Using a configurational approach (involving complementarity and equifinality), we propose that firms use different OI configurations, by combining three openness practices (high number of alliances, partner diversity, and external R&D) and four complementary organizational assets (human capital, alliance coordination capabilities, inter-organizational learning capabilities, and patenting orientation), and that such configurations affect OI performance. We conducted a survey study on the Spanish biotech industry. A sample of 75 companies was analyzed using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results revealed seven high-performing configurations and six low-performing configurations. Configurations combining one or more OI practices and complementary organizational assets achieved a high OI performance, while open configurations lacking the necessary organizational assets were not successful. Closed configurations also performed poorly. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.;The aim of this research is twofold: first, to identify Open Innovation configurations, and second, to analyze which configurations are associated with a high, and which with a low, OI performance.

Kowalski A.M., Mackiewicz M.;"Commonalities and differences of cluster policy of Asian countries; discussion on cluster open innovation";2021;The article aims at investigating the commonalities and differences between cluster policies in selected East Asian and Southeast Asian countries: Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, and China, to outline the Asian model of a cluster policy. Clusters play a significant role in the economic development of these countries, and some practical experiences from Asia may be used to shape the cluster policy in the recovery process after the COVID-19 pandemic. The conducted research contributes to a better understanding of the cluster formation process, cluster development, and policy aims in the analyzed countries. In Singapore and South Korea, which are among the most innovative countries in the global economy, cluster policy is to a great extent part of innovation policy, focusing on facilitating the networking and cooperation between science and business, the flow of knowledge, transfer of technology, and developing innovative technologies of key economic importance. In China and Thailand, which are developing countries, there is a much stronger role of foreign direct investments, which take the central place in the cluster structure. However, one common characteristic of cluster development patterns in all the analyzed countries is a top-down approach, where clusters are emerging and developing mostly as a result of governmental decisions and public programs. © 2021 by the authors.

Aslesen H.W., Freel M.;Industrial Knowledge Bases as Drivers of Open Innovation?;2012;The article presents an analysis of a large-scale survey with the aim of understanding differences in the open, interactive and distributed nature of external innovation relations amongst firms belonging to different industrial knowledge bases. The thesis is that the source of critical innovation relevant knowledge differs between industrial knowledge bases, making the character and the need of openness contingent on these specificities. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will observe systematic variations in how industries access and combine innovation-related external knowledge. In our analyses we attempt to address a gap in the literature by examining how industrial knowledge bases affect the recombination of knowledge by analysing the different extents, forms (formal and informal) and geography of inbound open innovation. The article illustrates that features and structures of inbound open innovation align, to a large extent, with the industries' knowledge bases and that there is a interplay between an industry's knowledge base, the internal organisation of innovation processes and the channels and geography of inbound open innovation. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;The article presents an analysis of a large-scale survey with the aim of understanding differences in the open, interactive and distributed nature of external innovation relations amongst firms belonging to different industrial knowledge bases.

Lichtenthaler U.;A note on outbound open innovation and firm performance;2015;The concept of open innovation has attracted a lot of interest over the past decade. In light of a relative emphasis on inbound open innovation (indicating an outside-in process) in prior research, this brief note addresses the relationship between outbound open innovation (indicating an inside-out process) and firm performance. In particular, it suggests that outbound open innovation may have positive and negative effects on firm performance based on potential benefits and risks of transferring technology. To what degree these effects materialize depends on internal factors, e.g. desorptive capacity, and external factors, e.g. appropriability. Consequently, a proficient internal management of outbound open innovation is critical to avoid its potential risks and to capture its substantial benefits. In this regard, future research may substantially deepen the insights into the relevance and role of outbound open innovation. © 2015 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;The concept of Open Innovation has attracted a lot of interest over the past decade.

Kovács A., Van Looy B., Cassiman B.;Exploring the scope of open innovation: a bibliometric review of a decade of research;2015;The concept of open innovation has attracted considerable attention since Henry Chesbrough first coined it to capture the increasing reliance of firms on external sources of innovation. Although open innovation has flourished as a topic within innovation management research, it has also triggered debates about the coherence of the research endeavors pursued under this umbrella, including its theoretical foundations. In this paper, we aim to contribute to these debates through a bibliometric review of the first decade of open innovation research. We combine two techniques—bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis—to (1) visualize the network of publications that explicitly use the label ‘open innovation’ and (2) to arrive at distinct clusters of thematically related publications. Our findings illustrate that open innovation research builds principally on four related streams of prior research, whilst the bibliographic network of open innovation research reveals that seven thematic clusters have been pursued persistently. While such persistence is undoubtedly useful to arrive at in-depth and robust insights, the observed patterns also signal the absence of new, emerging, themes. As such, ‘open innovation’ might benefit from applying its own ideas: sourcing concepts and models from a broader range of theoretical perspectives as well as pursuing a broader range of topics might introduce dynamics resulting in more impact and proliferation. © 2015, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.;The concept of Open Innovation has attracted considerable attention since Henry Chesbrough first coined it to capture the increasing reliance of firms on external sources of innovation.

Ollila S., Yström A.;An investigation into the roles of open innovation collaboration managers;2017;The concept of open innovation has gained traction among practitioners and academics. Many different aspects of open innovation have been researched, but the question of how to manage open innovation collaboration in order to achieve the desired knowledge flow across organizational boundaries remains only partly answered. Consequently, this article argues for the need to complement prior firm-centric perspectives by investigating the roles of senior management in the postmodern form of organizing that characterizes open innovation collaboration. A more in-depth understanding of managerial roles in this context can increase the chances of fruitful collaboration. Thus, the article uses an inductive, interview-based approach to explore senior management roles in two institutionalized open innovation collaborations, thereby creating an initial conceptualization of the role of managers in open innovation and forming a basis for further studies on open innovation management. In this respect, the article identifies and discusses additional managerial roles that appear to be crucial for open innovation collaborations. These roles are those of a facilitator, tactician, and sensegiver. © 2016 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd;The concept of Open Innovation has gained traction among practitioners and academics.

Most empirical investigations about this emerging concept have been case studies of successful early adopters of open innovation, and their analyses have largely been at the company level. Although case studies at that level provide meaningful implications, the new phenomena merit a more in-depth examination: that is, we need to collect and analyze data on multiple companies to explore more systematic findings about open innovations across companies. Moreover, analyses may need to go down to the individual project rather than the whole company level because innovation activities are often conducted as part of research and development (R&D) projects. To meet these needs, this study examines companies' open innovation efforts at the level of the individual R&D project. Specifically, the present study focuses on project-level openness to better understand the mechanisms of open innovation. It explores systematic relationships between various antecedent factors and the degree of openness. Project-level openness could be affected by team and task characteristics, such as team size, learning distance, strategic importance, technology and market uncertainty, and relevance to the main business. Relevant data collected from 303 companies in Korea were used to identify the antecedents that affect inbound and outbound openness. The research findings are expected to help provide a concrete theoretical framework suited for more generalized application and further practical development of open innovation strategy. © 2015 RADMA and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;The concept of Open Innovation has recently gained wide academic attention, as it seems to have significant impact for company performance.

Lichtenthaler U.;Open innovation: Past research, current debates, and future directions;2011;"The concept of open innovation has recently gained widespread attention. It is particularly relevant now because many firms are required to implement open innovation, despite the difficulties associated with managing these activities. After providing a definition of open innovation delimiting it from open source, an overview of prior research is given, which identifies the following important topics of earlier open innovation research: technology transactions, user innovation, business models, and innovation markets. In light of current controversial debates about the value of the open innovation framework, we evaluate the literature and assess whether open innovation is a sustainable trend rather than a management fashion. On this basis, we present a conceptual framework that provides the foundation for discussing critical open innovation processes and their implications for managing open innovation at the organizational, project, and individual level. Thus, we assess the multilevel determinants of the make-or-buy, integrate-or-relate, and keep-or-sell decisions in opening up the innovation process. Then, we propose a research agenda based on this conceptual framework with particular emphasis on the organizational antecedents and performance consequences of open innovation and on important research design issues. Finally, we discuss implications for management education and practice, and we provide a conclusion and outlook.

Wikhamn B.R.;Two different perspectives on open innovation - libre versus control;2013;The concept of open innovation has successfully diffused in academia as well as in industry. However, criticisms have at the same time been raised regarding the lack of a precise definition and also similar past research has not been sufficiently recognized. This paper highlights two perspectives of openness related to innovation - open as 'libre' versus 'controlled' - arguing that they rest on different underlying assumptions and theoretical foundations related to knowledge and value production. The paper concludes that the general research on 'open innovation' implicitly utilizes both perspectives, which tends to give a somewhat fragmented and incoherent perception of what open innovation is and how it should be applied in practice. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;The concept of Open Innovation has successfully diffused in academia as well as in industry.

Tödtling F., van Reine P.P., Dörhöfer S.;Open Innovation and Regional Culture-Findings from Different Industrial and Regional Settings;2011;"The concept of open innovation, building upon ideas of ""interactive innovation"" and ""innovation networking"" has gained interest more recently. It argues that companies should increasingly also rely on ideas and knowledge developed externally, and create external paths for innovation.

Open innovation and networking are no general phenomena but depend on certain company and regional characteristics such as the respective innovation culture. The interrelationship between open innovation and regional culture has been explored by studies on regional advantage emphasizing socio-cultural aspects of opening up innovation, the literature on regional clusters, emphasizing knowledge sharing in networks, and the contributions to regional innovation systems, emphasizing the role of the institutional environment. We investigate examples of open innovation for different regions of Europe including high-tech and low-tech industries: The Southeast region of The Netherlands (high-tech systems centred on Philips and performance materials centred on DSM), Basel (Life Science industry focused on Novartis and other firms) and Styria (metal industry).

However, under the constant pressure of being innovative, companies have to try harder to tap their customers' knowledge and abilities. Crowdsourcing communities provide an arena for a vast amount of consumers to actively participate in innovation processes.

The sample included data of daily closing stock prices and volume of stock trade during the three months before (−90 days) and after (+90 days) the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic ongoing, totaling 2670 observation data both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, for a total of 5340. The research findings indicate a significant difference between the daily closing stock price and volume of stock trade before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The current research has both theoretical and practical implications: the findings strengthen the efficient market hypothesis, which states that the more complete the provided information, the more efficient the market. The practical implication is that investors should be careful when choosing to invest. Investors should choose customer goods sector companies that provide products that are much needed by customers, for example, pharmacy, food, beverages, etc. Future research is needed to investigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on the economy. © 2020 by the authors.

Puriwat W., Tripopsakul S.;The impact of digital social responsibility on preference and purchase intentions: The implication for open innovation;2021;The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed people’s life and the ways businesses implement their social responsibility initiatives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, online and digital platforms have been increasingly realized as important mechanisms for businesses undertaking and implementing socially responsible activities—digital social responsibility (DSR). The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of DSR on brand preference and consumers’ purchase intention comparing between high and low involvement product categories. The quantitative empirical research was conducted by using an online questionnaire instrument, and a Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) technique was used to test the proposed model. Based on 194 samples of Thai respondents collected in November to December 2020, the findings demonstrate that DSR initiatives are significantly and positively associated with brand preference and with consumers’ purchase intention. The moderating result reveals that product involvement plays a significant role in strengthening the association between DSR initiatives and brand preference. The effect of DSR on brand preference is stronger for low product involvement respondents than for high product involvement respondents. The research highlights the significance of DSR and extends the current knowledge about DSR and its potential impact on customers’ perception. © 2021 by the authors.

The transition from face-toface to virtuality has affected the entire educational process favoring one of the open innovation key features in the higher education institutions: the ability to manage knowledge flow. Open innovation in this crisis situation will encourage universities to deal with difficulties and embrace opportunities to enhance knowledge production. In this regard, the main objective of this work is to analyze how universities have managed knowledge flow during lockdown situation. The research presents a comparative study between three countries highly impacted by the coronavirus (Spain, Italy and Ecuador) based on perceptions from teachers and students on a convenience sample of 573 individuals. The study, of a descriptive and exploratory nature, applied surveys between March and April 2020 to students and teachers of Journalism, Communication. The survey had 2956 responses, collecting 65,032 pieces of evidence from students and 6468 from teachers. Teachers and students show their preference for being present, but they recognize the justification for the change of scenery and identify positive elements in virtuality. According to the findings obtained, the absence of presence has not generated an increase in the meetings between teachers and students. In addition, the tutorials have been shorter and sporadic. Added to this is a scant commitment to the variety of resources and options offered by the Internet. The predominance of textual material collides with the demand from students for a mixture of training resources, a greater role for the podcast and, especially, a typology of assessment tests that pass the traditional exams. © 2021 by the authors.

The current situation has provoked the need for a total decrease in the crude oil production in the world. Considering that Russia is one of the main oil exporters on the world market, the need to determine the supply and demand levels for Russian oil is becoming relevant. The aim of the paper is to model predictive scenarios of Russian oil industry development, considering the specifics of the current economic environment given the COVID-19 pandemic. The multifactor correlation modeling method was used to form the system of indicators determining the level of demand and supply for Russian oil used and the total level of their influence. The functions determine the probability of implementing various scenarios of oil industry development depending on the predicted values of demand and supply. The three-sigma rule and the fuzzy sets method were used to estimate three scenarios of oil industry development for 2020-2021. Changes in revenues of the industry under the influence of forecast indicators of supply and demand for oil have been assessed and the probability of implementation of each of the scenarios has been reasoned. The results obtained are of a practical nature and can be used by government agencies, financial intermediaries, and scientists to diagnose Russian oil industry development.

Although there is an increased interest in studies on FFs and open innovation (OI), the existing knowledge is rather limited. This study explores the determinants of OI in FFs. We focus on two distinctive types of FFs: those held and managed by family members and FFs where ownership and management are disjointed, leading to non-family managers being involved in strategic decision-making. Our study shows that FFs managed by non-family managers are motivated by an innovation strategy that is more aggressive, more oriented towards technological excellence and radical innovation as compared to FFs managed by family managers. And they are more likely to search for a broader set of external sources in embracing OI. We argue that the presence of non-family managers is what makes the difference in shaping firm behaviour in terms of OI breadth. © 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.;The degree of openness in innovation is a key strategic decision of family firms (FFs).

Sjödin D.R., Eriksson P.E., Frishammar J.;Open innovation in process industries: A lifecycle perspective on development of process equipment;2011;The development and installation of new process equipment in production plants typically requires strong collaboration among a process firm and various equipment suppliers. While incentives to collaborate often are strong, close collaboration also poses significant problems, throughout the lifecycle of process equipment. The purpose of this article is to explore the problems and opportunities faced by process firms and their equipment suppliers throughout the lifecycle stages of collaborative development projects. This paper combines literature on open innovation, collaborative development and buyer-supplier relationships. Empirically, we draw on a large number of interviews in a dual case study of two process firms. Our results show that strong collaboration is neither positive nor negative in general. Rather, opportunities, problems, and collaboration intensity are strongly contingent on the specific stage in the lifecycle of process equipment. Our findings underscore the managerial and theoretical importance of a lifecycle perspective on the development of process equipment, since significant overlaps and interconnections exist across different stages.

"Mack, T; Landau, C";Submission quality in open innovation contests - an analysis of individual-level determinants of idea innovativeness;2020;"The digital age allows for integration of dispersed groups into the innovation process. These heterogeneous groups of individuals varying in size and knowledge distribution, also referred to as crowds, build the basis for open innovation contests (OIC), one of the most common forms of crowdsourcing innovation. Different from more focused forms of open innovation, at OIC innovation managers often do not identify or evaluate participants ex-ante. Instead, innovation managers often make use of open calls for participation and assume efficient self-selection of participants i.e., that only motivated and qualified participants will volunteer and engage in the innovation contest. This behavior reflects one of the key assumption of crowdsourcing in participatory innovation settings. However, not every self-selected member is in the position to solve the contest task appropriately. Hence, innovation contests often result in large numbers of submissions, covering a wide range of quality levels, causing decision biases and significant workloads for innovation managers to select ideas. This problem is referred to as ""crowding"". In order to reduce ""crowding"", open innovation researchers are interested in understanding which types of individuals make the ""best"" contributions and therefore should be preferably encouraged to participate in in OIC. In this paper, we are assessing what characterizes those participants who submit innovative ideas to OIC, in particular those who submit incremental ideas vs. those who have more radical ideas. Drawing on the componential model of creativity and data generated in innovation contest held by chocolate producer Ritter Sport, we analyze the effect of participants' creativity, domain knowledge, and several motivational factors on the innovativeness of their contributions. We find all of these factors to affect the innovativeness of an idea. However, regarding generating incremental or radical innovations, some factors have opposing roles. Our findings imply for practice that innovation managers must decide which type of innovations they intend to generate and then design contests to attract participants with the required characteristics, if they want to increase the number of appropriate ideas and reduce the problems of ""crowding"".";"The digital age allows for integration of dispersed groups into the innovation process.

Nonetheless, most attempts at starting new businesses will be unsuccessful. This study seeks to predict new venture success (‘Take-off’) based on different factors observed in the pre-startup phase. We apply the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) to develop a framework synthesizing the entrepreneurship and Open Innovation (OI) literatures on new venture creation. We then assess the influence of three categories of internal resources (finance, technology, human capital) and introduce the concept of teams' ‘openness’ in the founding process as a crucial organizational capital resource shaping startup success. Drawing on a sample of 134 business plans submitted to the final round of the INTEL Global Challenge at UC Berkeley, we significantly associate ‘Take-off’ to each category of resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to emphasize the relevance of teams' ability to combine and transform their initial resources through the pursuit of OI (i.e., the elaboration of organizational capital resources) in explaining startup success. Our analysis extends RBV-based research on nascent entrepreneurship and suggests new fields of research into OI. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;The formation of new ventures is among the most significant sources of technological innovation and fast economic development.

Mubarak M.F., Petraite M.;Industry 4.0 technologies, digital trust and technological orientation: What matters in open innovation?;2020;The fourth industrial revolution, termed Industry 4.0, offers a vital and valuable opportunity to drive social and technological innovations. It has state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems and related technological architecture, which can drastically increase a firm's productivity and innovation performance. Nevertheless, Industry 4.0 is also significantly shortening the product life cycles and demanding the pace of innovation to be accelerated. A firm, however, cannot accelerate the pace of its innovation by exclusively relying only on its internal resources. This is the reason firms are increasingly adopting open innovation strategy through collaboration with external stakeholders. The critical challenge that firms are facing while managing open innovation is trust among the stakeholders. Digital trust, attained through Industry 4.0 technologies, can play an instrumental role in promoting open innovation. Against this backdrop, the present study investigates the impact of digital trust on open innovation performance. The study investigates the role of technological orientation and technological absorption capacity in the association between digital trust and open innovation. Cross-country data of 324 electrical and electronics firms of three major Asia-Pacific countries, namely Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, were collected using a close-ended questionnaire. The study employed partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and PLS-multi group analysis (PLS-MGA) to analyze the modeled relationships. The results reveal that digital trust, composed of trust and Industry 4.0 technologies, has a significant positive impact on a firm's open innovation. Likewise, results also depict a strongly positive moderating role of technological orientation in the association between digital trust and open innovation. Finally, results also exhibit a significant mediating role of both potential and realized technological absorptive capacities in the association of digital trust and open innovation. It is the first-ever study discussing the linkage of digital trust with open innovation.

Park E., Kim B., Park S., Kim D.;Analysis of the effects of the Home Energy Management System from an open innovation perspective;2018;The Home Energy Management System (HEMS) is a system for the efficient electric power consumption of each household. It can provide real-time electricity cost information according to electricity consumption, and households can immediately control their consumption of electricity. In this study, we analyzed the effects of the HEMS on the stability of demand for electric power. To do this, we analyzed the causal relationship between the amounts of electric power generation and consumption, from the system dynamics perspective. From the analysis, we found that in the current structure, the fluctuation of the quantity of demand became large due to the time delay in households recognizing the electric bill and adjusting their electric power consumption. However, when the HEMS was introduced, it could be seen that electric power demand remained stable since consumers could see their electricity bill in real-time and could manage their electricity consumption by themselves. © 2018 by the authors.;The Home Energy Management System (HEMS) is a system for the efficient electric power consumption of each household.

Lu P., Yuan S., Wu J.;The interaction effect between intra-organizational and inter-organizational control on the project performance of new product development in open innovation;2017;The importance of control in the success of a project was clearly established in project literature. However, the impact mechanisms of intra-organizational and inter-organizational control on the performance of new product development (NPD) performance did not receive considerable attention in the increasingly important context of open innovation. To fill this gap, this study explores intra-organizational and inter-organizational control and their interaction effect on NPD performance in open innovation. The results show that intra-organizational formal control and inter-organizational trust positively influence NPD performance, whereas intra-organizational professional control and inter-organizational contract control have no significant effect.

Pellegrini L., Lazzarotti V.;How governance mechanisms in family firms impact open innovation choices: A fuzzy logic approach;2019;The inbound open innovation (OI) process consists of the opening of the innovation funnel to the contribution of external partners, with the aim of tapping into their knowledge. This opportunity is particularly valuable for family firms (FFs), which often have insufficient resources. However, the literature on the OI behaviour of family firms is not conclusive. Indeed, both the behavioural theory (BT) and the resource-based view (RBV) posit negative and positive outcomes regarding openness choices in FFs. We claim that these contrasting results can be reconciled if, according to the literature, FFs are seen as a heterogeneous breed, whose differences are determined by different levels of participation of non-family members in the governance mechanisms. Indeed, non-family members can act in favour of OI. However, previous literature has failed to satisfactorily grasp the nuances of this heterogeneity. We suggest that it is necessary to adequately operationalize the heterogeneity concept by means of fuzzy logic. We conducted a survey on 178 Italian FFs. Results show that the involvement of non-family members affects the extent to which firms draw on knowledge from external partners. Specifically, the higher the involvement of non-family members, the more there is collaboration with vertical partners along the supply chain. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;The inbound Open Innovation process consists of the opening of the innovation funnel to the contribution of external partners, with the aim of tapping into their knowledge.

Huber S.;Methodology and Tool Support for Adaptive Idea Exploitation in Open Innovation;2017;The lack of efficiency and transparency regarding cross-company collaboration in the field of open innovation often leads to cost intensive and unsuccessful products and services. This is because traditional approaches fail to cope with emerging requirements in innovation projects, e.g., the vertical and horizontal integration of strategic partners within and across the company’s value network. However, to maintain their competitive advantage, companies seek a constant and sustainable development of their product and service portfolio. In this context, knowledge work plays an important role in the collaborative development of innovative product and service ideas. For that reason, knowledge workers need systematic support regarding both methodological and operational challenges. The concept of Adaptive Case Management emerged from the necessity to support knowledge workers in unpredictable and highly creative working environments, especially in the field of Business Process Management. Therefore, the contribution shows, both from a conceptual and technological point of view, how to combine those approaches to support knowledge workers in dynamic innovation projects. To test the validity of the concept, a software prototype serves as the foundation for interviews with experts of the innovation department of a large international industrial company. © 2016, Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden.;The lack of efficiency and transparency regarding cross-company collaboration in the field of Open Innovation often leads to cost intensive and unsuccessful products and services.

Dolfsma W., van der Eijk R.;Behavioral Foundations for Open Innovation: Knowledge Gifts and Social Networks;2017;The literature on “open innovation” so far focuses almost exclusively on strategic issues. In this largely conceptual paper we propose behavioral foundations for knowledge exchange and knowledge sharing to address this gap in the literature. Innovation and knowledge development that result from knowledge transfer, is an uncertain and cumulative process that typically involves a number of parties. Knowledge transfer between people and firms has been fruitfully studied from a structural or network perspective. The social network literature however, faces an “action problem”. Focusing on structural elements such as an agent’s position in a network and the types of relations entertained cannot explain why actors actually do share knowledge. The exchange of knowledge is elusive and is a discretionary act for the people involved, certainly in the case of open innovation (OI). It is argued here that social network analysis is to be complemented by the concept of gift exchange, drawing on social exchange literature. Gift exchange–following Mauss’ dictum to “give, receive and reciprocate”– establishes obligations between people especially under circumstances of ambiguity, which explain why and how knowledge exchange relations are established, persist, and may also end. Relationships in a social network and the social capital that inheres in these cannot be drawn on at will to exchange knowledge. These obligations established by gift exchange between individuals who share a connection explain why agents exchange knowledge with each other even in the absence of markets or hierarchy. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;The literature on “Open Innovation” so far focuses almost exclusively on strategic issues.

Ferraris A., Santoro G., Bresciani S.;Open innovation in multinational companies' subsidiaries: The role of internal and external knowledge;2017;The mainstream literature on innovation management has recognised that most organisations can and must innovate using both internal and external knowledge sources. The management of knowledge in multinational companies (MNCs) implies that subsidiaries should achieve centrality because they are in the unique position to tap into many different sources of knowledge from different cultural contexts. In this context, this paper aims to highlight the importance of 'openness' at the subsidiary level, combining both external and internal knowledge (within the MNC but outside the subsidiary). To do so, we test the single and joint effects of external and internal 'openness' on subsidiaries' innovation performance. Using Amadeus databases, 163 subsidiaries were selected and data were collected through a standardised questionnaire. Then, three hypotheses were tested through an OLS regression model. The results indicate that external and internal knowledge openness positively affects subsidiaries' innovation performance. Moreover, the inclusion of the interaction term shows that a high level of both leads to a multiplicative and positive effect. The findings are discussed in the light of the extant literature, and several implications for future research and MNC and subsidiary managers are highlighted. © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.;The mainstream literature on innovation management has recognised that most organisations can and must innovate using both internal and external knowledge sources.

Saura J.R., Debasa F., Reyes-Menendez A.;Does user generated content characterize Millennials' generation behavior? Discussing the relation between SNS and open innovation;2019;The millennial generation plays a leading role in today's connected world in which exists a confluence of numerous technologies and the internet in science, economy and innovation. This study aimed to identify the key factors that characterize the millennial generation within the online chatter on Twitter using an innovative approach. To this end, we analyzed the user generated content (UGC) in the social network (SNS) Twitter using a three-steps knowledge-based method for information management. In order to develop this method, we first used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a state-of-the-art thematic modeling tool that works with Python, to analyze topics in our database. The data were collected by extracting tweets with the hashtag #Millennial, #Millennials and #MillennialGeneration on Twitter (n = 35,401 tweets). Secondly, sentiment analysis with a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was also developed using machine-learning. Applying this method to the LDA results resulted in the categorization of the topics into those that contained negative, positive and neutral sentiments. Thirdly, in order to gather the final results, data text mining techniques were used. The negative factors that characterize the behavior of this generation are depression, loneliness and real-world relationship. The positive factors are body image, self-expression, travelers and digital life and the neutral factors are self-identity and anxiety. Practical implications can be used by public actors, companies or policy makers that are focused on the millennial generation as a target. The study has important theoretical applications as the topics discovered can be used to test quantitative models based on the findings and insights extracted from the UGC sample. © 2019 by the authors.;The millennial generation plays a leading role in today's connected world in which exists a confluence of numerous technologies and the internet in science, economy and innovation.

Tani M., Papaluca O., Sasso P.;The System Thinking Perspective in the Open-Innovation research: A systematic review;2018;The new logics of competitions are mostly based on exploiting relationships to implement new mechanisms in managing Knowledge. Today, a successful company should be, lean, modular, and with a smart approach to new products development. In this context, the source of competitive advantage cannot be found into a static heterogeneity of resources, but companies must be able to create and manage a dynamic competitive process to continuously reinvent their products/services and to re-combine their resources with their partners' ones. A paradigm for this behavior is the Open Innovation one, as created by Chesbrough. According to the rules of this paradigm, companies have to acknowledge that they operate in a network of relationships, they must be open to cooperate with their external partners, and they must not try to limit their actions in reaching only for some pre-defined result. So, Open Innovation Networks appear to be similar to those described by the scholars in the Complex Adaptive Systems field where the actions of the system, and of its parts, are the result of the various actors' interactions in an emergent way. In this paper, we use a Systematic Literature Review approach to explore how the main topics in the System Thinking Perspective, and in particular, those related to Complex Systems, are linked to the Open Innovation studies. © 2018 by the authors.;The new logics of competitions are mostly based on exploiting relationships to implement new mechanisms in managing Knowledge.

So, Open Innovation Networks appear to be similar to those described by the scholars in the Complex Adaptive Systems field where the actions of the system, and of its parts, are the result of the various actors' interactions in an emergent way. In this paper, we use a Systematic Literature Review approach to explore how the main topics in the System Thinking Perspective, and in particular, those related to Complex Systems, are linked to the Open Innovation studies. ;10.3390/joitmc4030038;2-s2.0-85055083123;Italy;"Economics, Econometrics and Finance; Social Sciences";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Del Vecchio P., Di Minin A., Petruzzelli A.M., Panniello U., Pirri S.;Big data for open innovation in SMEs and large corporations: Trends, opportunities, and challenges;2018;The notion of ‘Big Data’ has recently been attracting an increasing degree of attention from scholars and practitioners in an attempt to identify how it may be leveraged to create innovative solutions and business opportunities. Specifically, Big Data may come from a variety of sources, especially sources outside the usual boundaries of organizations, and it represents an interesting and emerging opportunity for sustaining and enhancing the effectiveness of the so-called open innovation paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior works have provided a broad overview of the use of Big Data for open innovation strategies. We aim to fill this gap. In particular, we have focused our investigation on two types of companies: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and big corporations, reviewing the major academic works published so far and analysing the main industrial applications on this topic. As a result, we provide a relevant list of the main trends, opportunities, and challenges faced by SMEs and large corporations when dealing with Big Data for open innovation strategies. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;The notion of ‘Big Data’ has recently been attracting an increasing degree of attention from scholars and practitioners in an attempt to identify how it may be leveraged to create innovative solutions and business opportunities.

Greco M., Grimaldi M., Cricelli L.;An analysis of the open innovation effect on firm performance;2016;The open innovation (OI) paradigm describes how firms innovate by interacting with other organizations. Several authors found that specific OI strategies have a positive effect on economic and industrial innovation performance. Nevertheless, over-search and over-collaboration phenomena might reduce the OI marginal returns when a firm resorts to additional external innovation partners. This article hypothesizes that the variety of external innovation channels (search breadth) used by a firm, the extent to which a firm draws deeply from them (search depth) and the extent to which a firm collaborates through different external channels (coupled OI) are curvilinearly related with innovation performance. The empirical models are estimated using 84,919 firms from Eurostat's Community Innovation Survey, which was conducted in 2008 across European countries. The results suggest that search breadth is curvilinearly related with all the measures of innovation performance, whereas search depth is not subject to diminishing marginal returns in most cases. Furthermore, this article shows that coupled OI is curvilinearly related with the development and commercialization of radically new products. The findings of this study make several contributions both in a practical perspective, showing how managers can put into practice different OI strategies to influence innovation performance, and in a theoretical perspective, suggesting a number of recommendations for future research. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd;The Open Innovation paradigm describes how firms innovate by interacting with other organizations.

Sikimic U., Chiesa V., Frattini F., Scalera V.G.;Investigating the Influence of Technology Inflows on Technology Outflows in Open Innovation Processes: A Longitudinal Analysis;2016;The open innovation (OI) paradigm emphasizes the importance of integrating inbound and outbound flows of technology to increase a firm's innovation performance. While the synergies between technology inflows and outflows have been discussed in conceptual OI articles, the majority of empirical studies have typically focused on either the inward or the outward dimension of OI. According to recent reviews of OI literature, there is a need for further research that takes an integrated perspective on this topic and studies the combination of the inbound and outbound dimensions of OI. This paper follows these calls by focusing on technology licensing as the main contractual form for OI, and by investigating the relationship between technology in-licensing and out-licensing activities at the firm level of analysis. In particular, this paper argues that technology in-licensing positively influences the volume of technology out-licensing through two mechanisms. The first—resource-based—occurs because in-licensing investments expand and enrich the firm's technology base, thus increasing its value and, as a result, creating more opportunities for out-licensing. The second—capabilities-based—occurs because, due to commonalities between technology in-licensing and out-licensing in terms of performed tasks and required skills, repeated execution of in-licensing transactions contributes to the development of higher out-licensing capabilities and, as a result, increase out-licensing volume. These arguments are tested using a panel dataset of 837 Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1998–2007. Consistent with the predictions, the empirical analysis shows that higher investments in in-licensing and more extensive in-licensing experience lead to superior volumes of technology out-licensing. These results contribute to research on OI and licensing, by empirically showing the existence of positive interactions between technology inflows and outflows and of synergies in the development of absorptive and desorptive capacities. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association;The Open Innovation paradigm emphasizes the importance of integrating inbound and outbound flows of technology to increase a firm's innovation performance.

Santamaría L., Nieto M.J., Barge-Gil A.;The relevance of different open innovation strategies for R&D performers;2010;The Open Innovation (OI) paradigm has emphasized the role of external knowledge in aiding internal R&D efforts. While most research based on this model has focused on high-tech sectors, this paper attempts to extend it to more mature industries.

The empirical results, based on a large sample of Spanish manufacturing firms, show that OI strategies are highly effective tools for making internal R&D efforts more successful, both in high- and low-tech sectors. In addition, the study finds evidence that market-based strategies are positively correlated to achieving process innovations, while partnering strategies have a similar relationship with product innovations.

Elmquist M., Ollila S., Yström A.;Beyond intermediation: The open innovation arena as an actor enabling joint knowledge creation;2016;The open innovation paradigm has created opportunities for the emergence of new actors to provide support for open innovation. It is acknowledged that knowledge creation is pivotal to innovation, but this has yet to be discussed in the context of open innovation intermediation. This paper based on a longitudinal study of SAFER, a traffic and vehicle safety research centre in Sweden, explores the role of an actor whose objective is to support joint knowledge creation in open innovation. Theoretical models of knowledge creation are used in the analysis and the identified activities go beyond intermediation, and include peer collaboration and mobilisation of a collective strategic body. These activities are fundamental to an open innovation arena - here introduced as a new type of actor.

Alexy O., George G.;Category Divergence, Straddling, and Currency: Open Innovation and the Legitimation of Illegitimate Categories;2013;The organizational literature is increasingly interested in the origins and consequences of category emergence. We examine the effects of being affiliated with categories initially considered illegitimate ('divergence'), and of organizational attempts to blur the boundaries between categories ('straddling'), on capital market reactions to firm announcements. We develop arguments for how these effects likely vary with increasing legitimation ('currency') of the category. We apply event study methodology to the complete population of firms' announcements of open source activities, an open innovation model for software development that is novel and defies the extant dominant logic of software production and valorization. Over a ten-year period, we find negative effects of divergence, positive effects of straddling, and that the magnitude of both these effects diminishes with increasing category currency.

Galati F., Bigliardi B.;The unintended effect of the Orphan Drug Act on the adoption of open innovation;2016;The Orphan Drug Act (ODA) was an historic attempt to stimulate the development of drugs for rare diseases, intended to help bring to the market drugs for diseases that the pharmaceutical industry might otherwise not have had the financial incentives to pursue. While the intended effects of this regulatory stimulus on innovation are widely analyzed, the unintended ones remain unexplored. Thus, the objective of this paper is to analyze and conceptualize the impact of a relevant regulatory stimulus, such as the ODA, on the adoption of the open innovation paradigm in the pharmaceutical industry. Results show that the ODA made the adoption of this paradigm by large pharmaceutical companies possible, even if it partially inhibited its implementation. Finally, this study develops a framework characterizing the orphan drug development process in terms of drivers, activities, and actors.

Michelino F., Lamberti E., Cammarano A., Caputo M.;Measuring Open Innovation in the Bio-Pharmaceutical Industry;2015;The paper suggests a methodology for measuring the degree of openness in companies' innovation processes through the analysis of annual reports. Four openness dimensions are defined based on costs and revenues deriving from open innovation activities and new investments and divestments of innovation-related intangibles, occurring in either separate acquisitions or business combinations. A synthetic measure of openness is defined, including all the four dimensions. The model is then applied to a sample of 126 global top R&D spending companies in the bio-pharmaceutical industry for the period 2008-2012, for a total of 630 annual reports analysed. Results show a negative correlation of openness degree with firm age, dimension and efficiency, with biotech companies being more open than pharmaceutical ones. The paper contributes to the research on open innovation by suggesting a comprehensive framework for the measure of the pecuniary dimension of the phenomenon in both inbound and outbound processes. From a managerial point of view, the framework can be used by companies to both monitor their own degree of openness and to benchmark it with those of competitors. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;The paper suggests a methodology for measuring the degree of openness in companies' innovation processes through the analysis of annual reports.

Renna P.;Peak electricity demand control of manufacturing systems by Gale-Shapley algorithm with discussion on open innovation engineering;2020;The peak power of the manufacturing systems can increase electricity costs and reduce the use of renewable energy suppliers. The power of the machining processes depends on the processing time of the operations. Then, the allocation of the power to the machines of a manufacturing system controls the processing time of the manufacturing operations. An efficient allocation model can reduce the peak power, keeping the throughput performance level. This paper proposes a game theory to allocate the power to the machines including the dependence of the processing time from the power allocated. The game model uses the Gale-Shapley algorithm that forms couples of under and overloaded machines. Then, each couple exchanges the power from the underloaded to overloaded machines. The model considers the global workload and the jobs in queue for each machine. A simulation model tests the proposed method compared to a benchmark where each machine works with fixed power. The simulation results show how the model can improve the performance of the manufacturing system in several conditions tested. In particular, the main benefits can be obtained when the manufacturing system has high or medium utilization or the uncertainty affects the processing time. © 2020 by the author.;The peak power of the manufacturing systems can increase electricity costs and reduce the use of renewable energy suppliers.

The simulation results show how the model can improve the performance of the manufacturing system in several conditions tested. In particular, the main benefits can be obtained when the manufacturing system has high or medium utilization or the uncertainty affects the processing time. ;10.3390/joitmc6020029;2-s2.0-85090082643;Italy;"Economics, Econometrics and Finance; Social Sciences";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Lee I., Kim E.;Factors affecting the outbound open innovation strategies in pharmaceutical industry: Focus on out-licensing deal;2019;The pharmaceutical industry is a high-technology industry that requires a combination of in-depth knowledge from various fields. It is characterized by high cost, high risk and a long-term perspective due to the high level of regulation. In addition, it is known that research and development (R&D) productivity is deteriorating in the industry. Under these conditions, the importance of open innovation strategies has been emphasized. Under an open innovation system, it is essential for firms to develop several dynamic capabilities to effectively manage their resources both internally and externally. Using a systematic framework of dynamic capabilities suggested by previous studies, this study focuses on the determinants affecting firms' desorptive capacities, which are measured as the number of out-licensing deals, as an indicator for the performance of their outbound innovation. For the analysis, negative binomial regression is employed and inventive capacity and connective capacity are selected as the determinants of the licensors' desorptive capacity. The results of regression analysis reveal that inventive capacity does not have a significant effect on desorptive capacity and that only connective capacity has a significant positive effect on desorptive capacity. © 2019 by the authors.;The pharmaceutical industry is a high-technology industry that requires a combination of in-depth knowledge from various fields.

Shin K., Lee D., Shin K., Kim E.;Measuring the efficiency of U.S. pharmaceutical companies based on open innovation types;2018;The pharmaceutical industry, where research and development (R & D) efficiency is central to company survival, has recently faced significant challenges. To increase efficiency, companies must implement strategies such as open innovation (OI), wherein they sell their intellectual property, maximize their use of external resources, adjust their structures, and implement new business models. In this study, we divided 701 U.S. pharmaceutical companies according to their OI strategies to measure and compare their R & D efficiencies between 2001 and 2016. We analyzed the deal data of companies by first dividing them into four groups (inside-out, outside-in, coupled, and closed) to calculate R & D efficiency using stochastic and meta-frontier analyses. In the first group analysis, the coupled group shows high technical efficiency, but in an overall comparison, the inside-out group achieves the highest efficiency values. These values increased between 2005 and 2010, when the R & D crisis in the industry was great at its highest. We thus identified the characteristics of each group based on our results, and presented extensive analyses using a time-series comparison and enterprise-level analysis. We claim that pharmaceutical companies can still cope with the current R & D crisis by implementing different OI strategies. © 2018 by the authors.;The pharmaceutical industry, where research and development (R & D) efficiency is central to company survival, has recently faced significant challenges.

Greco M., Locatelli G., Lisi S.;Open innovation in the power & energy sector: Bringing together government policies, companies’ interests, and academic essence;2017;The Power and Energy (P&E) sector needs to respond to several challenges fostering investments in research and development. According to the Open Innovation (OI) paradigm, key stakeholders like utilities, vendors, laboratories, universities etc. should take advantage of external knowledge to improve their innovation performance. Several studies have demonstrated that firms adopting the OI paradigm are more likely to innovate. Despite the interest of P&E firms in enhancing their innovation capabilities, surprisingly few articles (usually case studies) described the implementation of the OI paradigm in P&E firms. This article fills the gap by identifying the key drivers that encourage a firm in the P&E sector to embrace the OI paradigm. The authors adopt a hybrid research approach collecting evidence from the literature and through a multiple case-study analysis involving seven British firms and universities operating in the P&E industry. As the drivers of OI have mutual influence, this article describes them with a fuzzy cognitive map. Finally, the authors identify appropriated policies to enhance the OI adoption and, consequently, the sustainability of innovation in the P&E sector.

Chaston I., Scott G.J.;Entrepreneurship and open innovation in an emerging economy;2012;The purpose of the paper is to examine the performance of firms in Peru in relation to entrepreneurial orientation and involvement in open innovation. Data were acquired through a survey of middle and senior managers employed in Peruvian companies. Firms achieving higher sales growth did not exhibit more of an entrepreneurial orientation or utilize a double loop learning style. More entrepreneurial firms appear to have adopted a double loop learning approach to knowledge acquisition. Peruvian firms involved in open innovation reported higher sales growth and indicated greater reliance on the use of double loop learning. The practical implications of the study are that firms in emerging economies do not have to be reliant on entrepreneurial behaviour to sustain business growth. Nevertheless involvement in open innovation can be beneficial. The originality of this paper is that although the results are only for companies in Peru, the findings may suggest that firms operating in emerging economies need not necessarily rely on entrepreneurial behaviour to sustain business growth, although involvement in open innovation may enhance business performance. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited;The purpose of the paper is to examine the performance of firms in Peru in relation to entrepreneurial orientation and involvement in Open Innovation.

Bengtsson L., Lakemond N., Lazzarotti V., Manzini R., Pellegrini L., Tell F.;Open to a Select Few? Matching Partners and Knowledge Content for Open Innovation Performance;2015;The purpose of the paper is to illuminate the costs and benefits of crossing firm boundaries in inbound open innovation (OI) by determining the relationships among partner types, knowledge content and performance. The empirical part of the study is based on a survey of OI collaborations answered by R&D managers in 415 Italian, Finnish and Swedish firms. The results show that the depth of collaboration with different partners (academic/consultants, value chain partners, competitors and firms in other industries) is positively related to innovation performance, whereas the number of different partners and size have negative effects. The main result is that the knowledge content of the collaboration moderates the performance outcomes and the negative impact of having too many different kinds of partners. This illustrates how successful firms use selective collaboration strategies characterized by linking explorative and exploitative knowledge content to specific partners, to leverage the benefits and limit the costs of knowledge boundary crossing processes.

Dittrich K., Duysters G.;Networking as a means to strategy change: The case of open innovation in mobile telephony;2007;"The purpose of this article is to investigate how innovation networks can be used to deal with a changing technological environment. This study combines different concepts related to research and development (R&D) collaboration strategies of large firms and applies these concepts to R&D alliance projects undertaken by Nokia Corporation in the period 1985-2002. The research methodology is a combination of in-depth semistructured interviews and a large-scale quantitative analysis of alliance agreements. For the empirical analysis a distinction is made between exploration and exploitation in innovation networks in terms of three different measures. As a first measure, the difference between exploration and exploitation strategies by means of the observed capabilities of the partners of the contracting firms is investigated. The second measure is related to partner turnover. The present article argues that in exploration networks partner turnover will be higher than in exploitation networks. As a third measure, the type of alliance contract will be taken; exploration networks will make use of flexible legal organizational structures, whereas exploitation alliances are associated with legal structures that enable long-term collaboration. The case of Nokia has illustrated the importance of strategic technology networks for strategic repositioning under conditions of change. Nokia followed an exploitation strategy in the development of the first two generations of mobile telephony and an exploration strategy in the development of technologies for the third generation. Such interfirm networks seem to offer flexibility, speed, innovation, and the ability to adjust smoothly to changing market conditions and new strategic opportunities. These two different strategies have led to distinctly different international innovation networks, have helped the company in becoming a world leader in the mobile phone industry, and have enabled it to sustain that position in a radically changed technological environment. This study also illustrates that Nokia effectively uses an open innovation strategy in the development of new products and services and in setting technology standards for current and future use of mobile communication applications.

This article conceptually links open innovation and clusters in the context of the fourth industrial revolution, empirically identifies barriers hindering open innovation in clusters, and indicates factors that might affect the open innovation processes in networked ecosystems. The findings confirm that the perception of barriers hindering open innovation in clusters differs between clusters already implementing open innovation and those which are still not active in this area. The findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the potential roles of clusters as open innovation intermediaries in the context of transitioning economies.

Comai A.;A new approach for detecting open innovation in patents: the designation of inventor;2020;The purpose of this paper is to understand to what extent open innovation (OI) is utilized in R&D departments by using patents as a main source. The paper adopts the “designation of the inventor” as a new method for detecting open or closed innovation, a method which examines the type of relationship that exists between the inventor(s) and the patent applicant(s). Since the openness or closedness of an invention is mainly measured by analyzing a firm’s co-applicants, the patent’s designation of the inventor indicates whether or not inventors are employees of the applicant. The paper offers new empirical evidence about whether a patent is open or not without surveying inventors and it complements previous studies that failed to describe whether a patent is based on open or closed innovation. After studying a collection of 231 patents in the wind energy sector obtained from the European Patent database, descriptive statistics show that OI Patents (OIPs) where the inventor is under agreement represent approximately 90% of the total number of OIPs, which in turn account for more than 23% of the total number of closed and open types of patent. Additionally, the designation of inventor method is also able to identify closed innovation-based patents. The results also show that a minority of companies utilize a hybrid type of OI, in which the inventors are composed of a mix of external individuals and employees. The results suggest that the method proposed yields a better understanding of how OI as well as other innovation strategies are utilized by firms in a particular industry or technological field. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.;The purpose of this paper is to understand to what extent Open Innovation is utilized in R&D departments by using patents as a main source.

"Madrid-Guijarro, A; Martin, DP; Garcia-Perez-de-Lema, D";Capacity of open innovation activities in fostering product and process innovation in manufacturing SMEs;2020;The purpose of this research is to study whether open innovation practices in SMEs favour technological innovations and the drivers of these. We propose a model of SME open innovation based on human capital (HC) approach and the commitment to learning with an emphasis on the risk taking and the formalization of an innovation strategy. The results, on a sample of 267 SMEs, show that a manager's attitude to risk-taking and the formalization of an innovation strategy are the most important variables which promote SME open innovation. Innovation strategy formalization leverages the impact of HC and commitment to learning on open innovation, identifying an important mediating effect. Finally, open innovation activities promote product and process innovation, although this effect is greater for outbound activities. These findings have important implications for both managers and policy-makers.;The purpose of this research is to study whether Open Innovation practices in SMEs favour technological innovations and the drivers of these.

Yun J.J.;How do we conquer the growth limits of capitalism? Schumpeterian Dynamics of Open Innovation;2015;"The purpose of this study is to answer the research question, ""How do we conquer the growth limits of capitalism?"" Based on existing studies on growth limits of capitalism by Marx and Schumpeter as well as the recent discussions of Drucker, Rifkin, and Piketty, the dynamic model of an open innovation economy system (OIES) is proposed as an answer to this research question. OIES consists of an open innovation economy, closed innovation economy, and social innovation economy. The dynamics of OIES occurs from the positive interaction among the open innovation economy, closed innovation economy, and social innovation economy. The dynamics of the OIES circle are from an open innovation economy, through a closed innovation economy and social innovation economy, and back to an open innovation economy again. In addition, the validation of the model for the dynamics of OIES is improved by simulating the life cycle of the dynamics of OIES, low-level OIES dynamics, and high-level OIES dynamics, and by inquiring about a practical economic system corresponding to each simulation situation. Next through a comparative discussion between the linear steps of Schumpeter 1 and 2, and Socialist Democracy, and the dynamics of an open Innovation economic system, the practical and theoretical characteristics of the dynamics of OIES are clearly defined. Finally, the limits of this study and a follow-up research project are presented in addition to a summary of the discussion. © 2015 Yun.";"The purpose of this study is to answer the research question, ""How do we conquer the growth limits of capitalism?""

Twenty three GRIs' royalty incomes and expenses (2013-2015) were analyzed using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. First, Research Model 1 was used to find out if the obligated expense category's distribution ratio were efficient. Five Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (CCR) model organizations and 14 Banker, Charnes and Cooper (BCC) model organizations demonstrated 100% efficiency. With the exception of the obligated expense category, Research Model 2 was used. Seventeen CCR model organizations and 18 BCC model organizations demonstrated 100% efficiency. GRIs were divided into efficient and inefficient organizations using each model, and potential improvements and benchmarking decision-making units (DMUs) were found for inefficient organizations. Second, multiple regression analysis in Research Model 2 was used to analyze the cause of the efficiency to find factors that influenced the transfer of technology and license improvement. Third, there were efficiency differences among research organizations as a result of the efficiency analysis considering the research organization type with respect to the constant returns to scale (CRS) efficiency of Research Models 1 and 2. Thus, different policies should be applied to improve the efficiency.

The analysis uses logistic regression to explore the existence of institutional ownership as a substitute for paying cash dividends in companies belonging to different industrial sectors. The results show that companies in the manufacturing sector have a greater propensity to pay dividends compared to those in non-manufacturing sectors. The results also indicate that low institutional ownership, as an external monitoring mechanism, can substitute for increasing the propensity to pay dividends. Overall, the results are consistent with implications in dividend policy. The results support the notion that the propensity to pay dividends accommodates different behavioral factors, considering sectoral differences. In addition, the results illustrate the relevance of alternative theories in explaining dividend policy from the perspective of agency theory.

In this study we critically scrutinized the implementation of such a publically open arena in the Swedish construction industry, which is an area with large costs for accidents and injuries. We used a two-step action research approach in order to compare the efficiency of a general arena (Innovation Stockholm) with a specialised health and safety arena, given the same radical supporting style and entrepreneurial culture.

Lichtenthaler U.;Intellectual property and open innovation: An empirical analysis;2010;The recent growth in inward and outward technology transfer, e.g., by means of technology licensing, reflects the new paradigm of open innovation. By actively acquiring and commercializing intellectual property in the technology markets, these open innovation processes contrast traditional closed innovation processes. Prior open innovation research has largely been limited to case studies and theoretical contributions, and other lines of research have focused either on inward or outward technology transfer without taking an integrative perspective. Therefore, I simultaneously consider inward and outward technology transfer as the two main directions of open innovation. On this basis, data from a survey of 154 industrial firms are used to test four hypotheses relating the size and quality of the corporate patent portfolio to a firm's extent of external technology acquisition and external technology commercialization. The results show that the corporate intellectual property portfolio constitutes a major determinant of opening up the innovation process.

Petroni G., Venturini K., Verbano C.;Open innovation and new issues in R&D organization and personnel management;2012;The steady growth of R&D costs and the increasingly widespread dissemination of information and communication technology over the past decade have resulted in the affirmation of the paradigm of open innovation, which consists in the continual expansion of access to sources of technological innovation outside the firm itself. Industrial companies are, in fact, turning more frequently to collaboration with university departments and other public and private research centers, and there is a notable increase in agreements regarding technological cooperation and the exchange of know-how between companies. In addition, recourse to highly specialized small research companies is on the rise. This is common, for example in the pharmaceutical sector and, more generally, in the area of biotechnological research. Furthermore, we are witnessing the development of the new role of innovation broker. These factors alter the traditional profile of company R&D structures, within which the role of researchers and technologists often changes. In particular, matrix and network organizational models are on the increase, and the professional figures of 'integrators of knowledge and expertise' (T-men) are assuming major importance at the expense of traditional scientists. As a consequence, the model for training and managing scientific personnel tends to change. This model, as it moves away from the prevailing pattern adopted by firms in Anglophone countries, is continually drawing closer, even from a cultural standpoint, to the R&D management approach found in the Japanese and German companies. The aim of this article is to investigate how the adoption of open innovation has changed the organizational structures of R&D and altered the methods used in managing its personnel. The results of the study are based on the analysis of four case studies of Italian multinational firms operating in the pharmaceutical, food, specialty chemical, and aerospace industries. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.;The steady growth of R&D costs and the increasingly widespread dissemination of information and communication technology over the past decade have resulted in the affirmation of the paradigm of Open Innovation, which consists in the continual expansion of access to sources of technological innovation outside the firm itself.

Sims J., Seidel V.P.;Organizations coupled with communities: The strategic effects on firms engaged in community-coupled open innovation;2017;"The study of open innovation has primarily focused on the benefits and consequences of inbound or outbound innovation exchange between firms; however, increasingly firms may be engaged in simultaneous inbound and outbound exchange forming a ""coupled"" approach. Furthermore, firms increasingly collaborate with communities as sources of innovation, but how does such ""communitycoupled open innovation"" affect a firm? Through an in-depth study of 250 firms collaborating with a leading open source software community, we show how this approach incorporates not only the exchange of intellectual property but also the provision of help. We find that while community-coupled open innovation does not affect productivity, it can expand a firm's social ties, lead to a more conservative strategic posture, and shift its innovation focus.

Greco M., Grimaldi M., Cricelli L.;Hitting the nail on the head: Exploring the relationship between public subsidies and open innovation efficiency;2017;The success of open innovation as a new paradigm to enhance innovation development has brought public authorities to incentivize firms to collaborate with external organisations. Such incentive is often provided in the form of public subsidies to research and development activities. Some studies observed that public subsidies are generally successful in pursuing the goal of promoting open innovation. Nevertheless, as the number of partners increases, the positive effect of collaboration on innovation performance is likely to decrease due to over-search and over-collaboration issues. In this perspective, a mere increase of the firms' propensity to collaborate should not satisfy public authorities, which instead should carefully monitor how public subsidies can improve the efficiency of such collaborations. This article advances the literature about the relationship between public subsidies and open innovation by assessing how funds provided by local, national and European authorities are associated with open innovation efficiency. By analysing an extensive sample of 43,230 European firms, this study confirms that the three typologies of public subsidies are associated with collaboration in beneficiaries. Furthermore, the study shows that local and national subsidies are also associated with open innovation efficiency, whereas European subsidies are not statistically significantly associated with it. This study provides theoretical and policy implications. In a theoretical perspective, it introduces the concept of open innovation efficiency, it analyses its public policy drivers and presents several recommendations for future research. In a policy perspective, it suggests explanations for the results obtained and advises policy initiatives to foster open innovation efficiency. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.;The success of Open Innovation as a new paradigm to enhance innovation development has brought public authorities to incentivize firms to collaborate with external organisations.

Guo Y., Zheng G.;How do firms upgrade capabilities for systemic catch-up in the open innovation context? A multiple-case study of three leading home appliance companies in China;2019;The technological catch-up behaviour of latecomer firms has been a topic of interest for the past three decades, especially in emerging economies, such as China and India. However, little research has systematically discussed the capability-upgrading issue that firms face in the context of open innovation, and the previous work lacks an explanation for why some Chinese firms can win competitive advantages in the global market within a short time. This study develops a PDSE (Position-Depth-Scope-Efficiency) framework of systemic catch-up to explain the process and mechanism of capability upgrading by using the literature on technological catch-up, open innovation, and the capability reconfiguration view. We conduct a multiple-case study based on three top home appliance manufacturers in China– Haier Group, Midea Group, and Gree Electronics. The results show that firms can achieve better positions, depth, and scope of catch-up with higher efficiency in the open innovation era. The process of systemic catch-up moves from component capability to architectural capability and then to systemic capability, while four mechanisms based on market and technology reconfigurations are effective in promoting capability upgrading. Overall, a key contribution of this paper is the offering of a new conceptual framework of systemic catch-up to outline the changes in the capability-upgrading process over time. This framework adds to the previous research that is mainly limited to the entry and gradual catch-up stages of capability development and deepens the understanding of the competitiveness of emerging economy firms beyond cost and scale advantages. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.;The technological catch-up behaviour of latecomer firms has been a topic of interest for the past three decades, especially in emerging economies, such as China and India.

Valdez-Juárez L.E., Gallardo-Vázquez D., Ramos-Escobar E.A.;Online buyers and open innovation: Security, experience, and satisfaction;2021;The topic of consumer behavior in a social context is important due to its influence on the behaviors and attitudes of individuals. New online business models are adopting open innovation practices focused on improving their sales channels through their technological capacity. In this paper, we analyze the purchase intentions in a business context to identify consumer needs through the proper purchase decision process. We must also observe the internal and external factors that influence consumer behavior. More exactly, electronic commerce is facing challenges and opportunities manifested by online consumers, such as design, security, trust, risk, uncertainty, and satisfaction with online purchases. Many external factors (economic, political, social, environmental, and health) influence buyers’ intentions and behaviors. The objectives of this study are to (1) determine the influence of the security level of websites on purchasing behaviors (socially responsible and panic buyers), (2) determine the effect of website security on consumer satisfaction, (3) determine the effect of buyers (socially responsible and panic buyers) on the level of satisfaction, and (4) examine if the buyer experience has a moderating effect between the variables (socially responsible and panic buyers) and the dependent variable (customer satisfaction). We focus on a sample of 663 socially responsible online buyers and panic buyers from the Sonora, Baja California, and Sinaloa regions in Mexico. Data were collected from the months of April to August 2020, and an online questionnaire was used address to each of the residents of these regions aged between 20 and 55 and who were economically active. The data were analyzed using the structural equation model-partial least squares (SEM-PLS) model based on variance. The findings show that website security has significant positive effects on socially responsible buyers, panic buyers, and the level of customer satisfaction. Socially responsible buyers also have positive effects on customer satisfaction. However, the relationship between panic buyers and customer satisfaction is not supported. Related to a moderation analysis, that the buyer experience has a significant effect on the relationship between socially responsible online buyers and the level of satisfaction. Conversely, we find empirical evidence of the buyer experience having no significant effect between panic buyers and customer satisfaction. Our findings contribute to the development of various theories: the theory of behavioral reasoning (BRT), social identity theory (SIT), and the technological adaptation model (TAM). From an academic point of view, the findings are positive and encouraging, contributing to the literature on the e-commerce, behaviors, and attitudes of purchase intentions of individuals. Our work is incorporated into the existing literature on purchase intention and virtual business models, whose characteristics need to continue to be outlined, constituting a popular business model in recent years. © 2021 by the authors.

Van Lancker J., Wauters E., Van Huylenbroeck G.;Managing innovation in the bioeconomy: An open innovation perspective;2016;The transition towards a bioeconomy is increasingly viewed by both policy makers and scholars as one of the primary ways to reduce our dependency on fossil resources. However, socio-economic research on the transition towards the bioeconomy at the firm-level remains scarce. Specifically, studies approaching the bioeconomy from the technology and innovation management (TIM) concepts are particularly uncommon, although the importance of knowledge generation and innovation is considered crucial to make the transition towards a greener economy. In this study, we take a first step in addressing this issue by developing a set of guiding principles for the management of innovation processes in the bioeconomy comprised in three key issues: the relevant stakeholder groups and their importance in innovation development within the bioeconomy, the innovation network strategy and management, and organizational features considered prerequisites for collaborative innovation. This called for an identification of influencing factors specific to the bioeconomy context and the establishment of basic characteristics of innovation processes in the bioeconomy. The five identified influencing factors, the basic innovation process characteristics, and the guidelines and recommendations presented in this paper are based on insights derived from a four-staged literature research of the bioeconomy and TIM literature. In particular, we focused on the Open Innovation approach because of the evident fit between this approach and the requirements for innovation in the bioeconomy. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.;The transition towards a bioeconomy is increasingly viewed by both policy makers and scholars as one of the primary ways to reduce our dependency on fossil resources.

Identifying these various barriers and understanding their interrelationships would provide a better understanding of the complex nature of the UTT process, which may be considered as inputs to crucial decision-making initiatives. This paper addresses this gap by holistically determining UTT barriers and their intertwined relationships. Using the Delphi method and fuzzy cognitive mapping, a case study in a state university in the Philippines was conducted to carry out this objective. The Delphi process extracts 24 relevant barriers of UTT, out of 46 barriers obtained from a comprehensive review of the extant literature. The results show that misalignment between research and commercialization objectives is the barrier that was influenced most by the other barriers. In contrast, high costs of managing joint research projects in terms of time and money and institutional bureaucracy have the highest out-degree measures or are the barriers that influence other barriers the most. These findings provide guidelines to various stakeholders and decision-makers in understanding the existence of barriers in the formulation of strategies and initiatives for a successful UTT process. © 2019 by the authors.;The University technology transfer (UTT) process is hindered by various barriers to achieving a successful translation of innovative technologies from universities to industries and other partners.

Bogers M., Foss N.J., Lyngsie J.;The “human side” of open innovation: The role of employee diversity in firm-level openness;2018;The use of external knowledge for innovation (i.e., inbound or outside-in open innovation) has received substantial attention in the innovation literature. However, the “human side” of open innovation is still poorly understood. We consider the role of employee characteristics with respect to predicting firm-level openness. Drawing on the human capital, learning and creativity literatures, we theorize that knowledge diversity of the firm's employees is positively associated with employees’ ability to identify and absorb external knowledge, which aggregates to increased firm-level openness—that is, firms’ use of external knowledge in their pursuit of innovation. Based on a combination of three data sources, namely, two survey data sources and register data, we find support for our hypothesis that employees’ educational diversity is positively associated with firm-level openness. However, we find no direct association between employees’ work history diversity and firm-level openness but rather—as also hypothesized—a conditional relationship based on educational background, which implies that diverse work history only has a positive impact at higher levels of educational diversity. To reduce endogeneity concerns, we undertake a series of robustness checks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.;The use of external knowledge for innovation (i.e., inbound or outside-in Open Innovation) has received substantial attention in the innovation literature.

Caetano M., Amaral D.C.;Roadmapping for technology push and partnership: A contribution for open innovation environments;2011;There are several tools in the literature that support innovation in organizations. Some of the most cited are the so-called technology roadmapping methods, also known as TRM. However, these methods are designed primarily for organizations that adopt the market pull strategy of technologyproduct integration. Organizations that adopt the technology push integration strategy are neglected in the literature. Furthermore, with the advent of open innovation, it is possible to note the need to consider the adoption of partnerships in the innovation process. Thus, this study proposes a method of technology roadmapping, identified as method for technology push (MTP), applicable to organizations that adopt the technology push integration strategy, such as SMEs and independent research centers in an open-innovation environment. The method was developed through action-research and was assessed from two analytical standpoints: externally, via a specific literature review on its theoretical contributions, and internally, through the analysis of potential users perceptions on the feasibility of applying MTP. The results indicate both the unique character of the method and its perceived implementation feasibility. Future research is suggested in order to validate the method in different types of organizations © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.;There are several tools in the literature that support innovation in organizations.

Watanabe C., Shin J.-H., Heikkinen J., Zhao W., Griffy-Brown C.;New functionality development through follower substitution for a leader in open innovation;2011;"There has been a paradigm shift to a knowledge-oriented economy in the 21st century. Consequently, there has also been a shift in where innovation typically occurs. This shift has been from the production site toward the process of product diffusion. That is, innovation occurs more frequently at the point at which a product or service is moved into the marketplace where it is immediately modified through customer interaction. In this process, new ""functionality"" - services, the delivery method or even product changes occur in the diffusion process. Given the need to constantly create new value through new product ""functionality"" or new ""functionality development"", firm strategy must address the issue of how to enhance innovation at this new locus - the diffusion process. Sustainable new functionality development over time has become crucial to a firm's competitiveness. In this context, firms have to develop new functionality as early and quickly as possible; leveraging whatever innovation exists in the marketplace. According to theory, the early emergence of functionality development in this context depends on a dynamic system in which the imitator (follower) is constantly substituting for the innovator (leader). This substitution corresponds to the dynamics observed in the process referred to as ""open innovation"". According to this theory, functionality development through follower substitution for a leader would be critical for a firm's competitiveness in the open innovation environment. Furthermore, open innovation could be a process for sustaining the ongoing creation of new value through functionality development maximizing limited resources.

This study aims to examine that how ambidextrous managers in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) craft their tasks as a strategy for open innovation to enhance business performance. This study also attempts to assess the moderating role of gender in evaluating the relationship. Simple random sampling is used to administer a structured questionnaire to 650 operations managers employed in service-sector SMEs. The findings reveal that, when male managers involve in explorative and exploitative activities, they tend to craft their jobs more as compared to females. In turn, when jobs are redesigned, it brings a positive impact on business performance as perceived by the managers. The study provides implications for the policy makers with regard to device measures to enhance the job crafting capacity of managers with specific attention to female managers in the case of small and medium enterprises.

Hewitt-Dundas N., Roper S.;Exploring market failures in open innovation;2018;There is now considerable empirical evidence demonstrating the innovation and performance benefits that accrue to firms engaging in open innovation (OI). Here, we use novel data on micro-businesses to show that the average level of engagement in OI falls well below the optimal level, a finding that reflects that of other empirical studies. We identify and examine three market failures which may help to explain this result. These relate to a lack of understanding of the potential benefits of OI by firms, a lack of information about the capabilities of potential partners and a lack of information about the trustworthiness of potential partners. Our findings provide evidence that policy initiatives designed to offset these information failures are likely to increase the range of partners with which firms engage with significant benefits for innovation. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.;There is now considerable empirical evidence demonstrating the innovation and performance benefits that accrue to firms engaging in Open Innovation.

Didenko N.I., Romashkina G.F., Skripnuk D.F., Kulik S.V.;Dynamics of trust in institutions, the legitimacy of the social order, and social open innovation;2020;This article analyses the dynamics of trust in institutions, which underpin the legitimacy of social order, on the basis of a study of the developed Arctic region during the period 2006–2018. The authors considered the principal theoretical concepts on which the study of trust, the well-being of citizens, the assessment of security and compliance with the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens is to be based. It is assumed that the legitimacy of the social order consists in a state where people not only trust specific institutions, but also enjoy a sense of security from threats and the ability to exercise basic rights and freedoms in the presence of a competent authority to protect them in case of violations. The dynamics of the security of the inhabitants of the region, associated with an increase in the level of their well-being, are considered. The structure for retaining the legitimacy of the social order is demonstrated on the basis of a number of indices and model calculations. Configuration analysis was carried out to support the construction of multidimensional models. It was concluded that there has been a dramatic collapse in the social activity of the inhabitants of the Arctic region bordering on social apathy. It is shown that, during the period under study, trust in local authorities significantly declined, while the importance attributed to respecting private property rights increased. Trust in social institutions is shown to be significantly lower than trust in government institutions, contradicting the situation in developed countries. It is recommended that more attention be paid to the functioning of local and municipal authorities governing the Arctic region, who are much more aware of the needs of the inhabitants since they are connected by much denser social ties. The authors substantiate the need to introduce social innovation that allows to diversify communication channels between the government and the public, meet unsatisfied social needs that are not solved by existing institutions and contribute to building trust between different participants. © 2020 by the authors.

Mayer H.;Catching up: The role of state science and technology policy in open innovation;2010;This article examines the impact of the emerging model of open innovation on state public policy, particularly the practice of technology-based economic development in weak research and development (R&D) states. Open innovation describes the nascent practice of firms using knowledge created outside their boundaries and also marketing ideas they would not commercialize themselves. Firms engaging in open innovation thrive on knowledge spillovers, and weak R&D regions could benefit from this model through the creation of Marshallian externalities. It is therefore interesting to ask whether weak R&D states take advantage of this model. This case study analysis shows that states involved in the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research partially support the emerging open innovation paradigm. All states have science and technology strategies and actively support and invest in their higher education infrastructure. They show variation in their support for university-industry partnerships, entrepreneurship, capital access, commercialization, and technology transfer. None of the states, however, uses the open innovation framework explicitly. © The Author(s) 2010.;This article examines the impact of the emerging model of Open Innovation on state public policy, particularly the practice of technology-based economic development in weak research and development (R&D) states. Open Innovation describes the nascent practice of firms using knowledge created outside their boundaries and also marketing ideas they would not commercialize themselves. Firms engaging in Open Innovation thrive on knowledge spillovers, and weak R&D regions could benefit from this model through the creation of Marshallian externalities. It is therefore interesting to ask whether weak R&D states take advantage of this model. This case study analysis shows that states involved in the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research partially support the emerging Open Innovation paradigm. All states have science and technology strategies and actively support and invest in their higher education infrastructure. They show variation in their support for university-industry partnerships, entrepreneurship, capital access, commercialization, and technology transfer.

"Yuan, QL; Gasco-Hernandez, M";Open innovation in the public sector: creating public value through civic hackathons;2019;This article examines the outcomes of open innovation (OI) and their contribution to public value by analysing 19 subnational civic hackathons across the US. Our analysis identifies three outcomes (digital prototypes, public engagement and relationship building, and government awareness of open data and OI) and lends support to the predominance of public engagement and relationship building over digital prototypes. Further, our study shows that OI initiatives may contribute to public value by enhancing substantive outcomes, democratic accountability, and procedural legitimacy. However, such contribution is constrained by the early stage of adoption of these initiatives and by the limited participation of external actors.;This article examines the outcomes of Open Innovation and their contribution to public value by analysing 19 subnational civic hackathons across the US.

Aitamurto T., Lewis S.C.;Open innovation in digital journalism: Examining the impact of Open APIs at four news organizations;2013;"This article examines the relative value of open innovation principles for digital media, exemplified by the emergence of Open Application Programming Interfaces (Open APIs) at four news organizations: The New York Times, The Guardian, USA Today and NPR. The use of Open APIs represents a shift toward an open innovation paradigm that may help address twin challenges facing the news industry: the need for improved R&D and the need for new revenue streams. This paper extends the interdisciplinary study of open innovation to digital communication. Findings indicate that the use of Open APIs has accelerated R&D through knowledge-sharing with web developers; generated new means of commercializing content by extending a firm's product portfolio; and forged innovation networks that function as external R&D departments.

Building on extant open innovation literature as well as on social capital theory, we develop a model that conceptualizes social capital as a mediator between the implementation of open innovation instruments and firm performance. In doing so, this paper adds to the understanding of the role of structure and content of social relations in open innovation contexts as well as of sustainable side-effects of open innovation. In particular, we argue that apart from a direct effect of open innovation instruments on firm performance, there is also a mediated relationship between these variables. More precisely, we propose that the implementation of open innovation instruments strengthens an organization's social capital, which is, in turn, positively related to firm performance. s© 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.;This article examines the role of social relations and networks in Open Innovation settings.

Padilla-Meléndez A., Del Aguila-Obra A.R., Lockett N.;Shifting sands: Regional perspectives on the role of social capital in supporting open innovation through knowledge transfer and exchange with small and medium-sized enterprises;2013;This article explores the role of social capital in enabling knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) between higher education institutions (HEIs) and spin-off (academic and non-academic) small and medium-sized enterprises in the context of open innovation, in order to convert knowledge into innovation within regional innovation systems. It presents the findings from 18 in-depth interviews with related stakeholders, and social network analysis of relationships in an exemplar technology park in Andalucía, southern Spain. The main findings suggest that there are many challenges to achieving successful KTE in regional innovation systems: recognition, intellectual property contracts and timescales. Similarly, there are opportunities related to intermediaries, joint teams and market impact.

Paskaleva K., Cooper I.;Open innovation and the evaluation of internet-enabled public services in smart cities;2018;This article is focused on public service innovation from an innovation management perspective. It presents research experience gained from a European project for managing social and technological innovation in the production and evaluation of citizen-centred internet-enabled services in the public sector. It is based on six urban pilot initiatives, which sought to operationalise a new approach to co-producing and co-evaluating civic services in smart cities – commonly referred to as open innovation for smart city services. Research suggests that the evidence base underpinning this approach is not sufficiently robust to support claims being made about its effectiveness. Instead evaluation research of citizen-centred internet-enabled urban services is in its infancy and there are no tested methods or tools in the literature for supporting this approach. The paper reports on the development and trialing of a novel Co-evaluation Framework, indicators and reporting categories, used to support the co-production of smart city services in an EU-funded project. Our point of departure is that innovation of services is a sub-set of innovation management that requires effective integration of technological with social innovation, supported by the right skills and capacities. The main skills sets needed for effective co-evaluation of open innovation services are the integration of stakeholder management with evaluation capacities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;This article is focused on public service innovation from an innovation management perspective.

Robbins P.;From Design Thinking to Art Thinking with an open innovation perspective-a case study of how Art Thinking rescued a cultural institution in Dublin;2018;This article uses a contemporary and revelatory case study to explore the relationship between three conversations in the innovation literature: Design Thinking, creativity in strategy, and the emerging area of Art Thinking. Businesses are increasingly operating in a VUCA environment where they need to design better experiences for their customers and better outcomes for their firm and the Arts are no exception. Innovation, or more correctly, growth through innovation, is a top priority for business and although there is no single, unifying blueprint for success at innovation, Design Thinking is the process that is receiving most attention and getting most traction. We review the literature on Design Thinking, showing how it teaches businesses to think with the creativity and intuition of a designer to show a deep understanding of, and have empathy with, the user. However, Design Thinking has limitations. By placing the consumer at the very heart of the innovation process, Design Thinking can often lead to more incremental, rather than radical, ideas. Now there is a new perspective emerging, Art Thinking, in which the objective is not to design a journey from the current scenario, A, to an improved position, A+. Art Thinking requires the creation of an optimal position B, and spends more time in the open-ended problem space, staking out possibilities and looking for uncontested space. This paper offers a single case study of a national arts organisation in Dublin facing an existential crisis, which used an Art Thinking approach successfully to give a much-needed shot in the arm to its commercial innovation activities. © 2018 by the authors.;This article uses a contemporary and revelatory case study to explore the relationship between three conversations in the innovation literature: Design Thinking, creativity in strategy, and the emerging area of Art Thinking.

Three main research questions are addressed: (1) what OI concepts are salient in their innovation portfolio?, (2) what OI concepts are used in the strategy formulation? and (3) what other concepts are present that augment OI? Interviews with 120 managers and archival documents were analyzed using thematic analysis. Two concepts prominent in the literature, (i) value capture models and (ii) technology evaluation criteria, were not present in this portfolio. By contrast, we found a focus on OI capability building, external information sharing and uncertain knowledge arbitrage in networks. Finally, we discuss these capabilities in relation to absorptive capacity, proposing a simple, but important bi-directional perspective to embrace OI. © 2010 The Authors.

Hong J.F.L., Zhao X., Stanley Snell R.;Collaborative-based HRM practices and open innovation: a conceptual review;2019;This conceptual paper analyses the role of collaborative-based HRM practices in supporting open innovation. There is already an extensive literature that investigates the impact of HRM practices on organizations’ innovation performance. As organizational boundaries become increasingly permeable and knowledge flows more freely, open innovation continues to receive close attention in management studies. However, relationships between HRM practices and open innovation have still not been examined. From a knowledge management perspective, we identify three kinds of barrier that may deter or impede open innovation. These relate to cognitive biases, concerns about transaction costs, and shortfalls in terms of organization capability. We also discuss the role of four types of collaboration-oriented HRM practices (i.e., teamwork-based recruitment, training in teamwork skills, team-based appraisals and rewards, and rotational job design) in reducing barriers to open innovation. Based on our analyses, we envisage future research directions about the role of collaborative-based HRM practices in supporting open innovation. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;This conceptual paper analyses the role of collaborative-based HRM practices in supporting Open Innovation.

Widayat W., Masudin I., Satiti N.R.;E-Money payment: Customers' adopting factors and the implication for open innovation;2020;This investigation was carried out on the adoption of the e-money payment model with the application of a quantitative and qualitative approach (mixed methods). Online questionnaires, which included closed-ended questions on a Likert five-point scale and open-ended questions, were distributed through social media chat groups. Respondent samples were drawn from the population of adolescent customers in Indonesia. The collected questionnaires were verified for accuracy, reliability, and validity before the data were analyzed. Adequate data were used to test the relationship model between latent variables, and the relationship of latent variables in the model was tested using partial least squares by employing Smart-PLS 3.0 software and NVIVO 12 plus. The final analysis shows that the reasons for adopting e-money are practicality and convenience. The main reasons that customers adopt electronic money are its practicality, ease of use, efficient transaction time, faster payment, and the simplicity of the payment process. The final modeling formed good-fit inner and outer models. This model verifies the significant influence of social factors, effort expectancy, and facilitation conditions on e-money attitudes. Additionally, social factors, effort expectancy, and attitudes have a significant influence on e-money behavior. © 2020 by the authors.;This investigation was carried out on the adoption of the e-money payment model with the application of a quantitative and qualitative approach (mixed methods).

The main reasons that customers adopt electronic money are its practicality, ease of use, efficient transaction time, faster payment, and the simplicity of the payment process. The final modeling formed good-fit inner and outer models. This model verifies the significant influence of social factors, effort expectancy, and facilitation conditions on e-money attitudes. Additionally, social factors, effort expectancy, and attitudes have a significant influence on e-money behavior. ;10.3390/JOITMC6030057;2-s2.0-85089488395;Indonesia;"Economics, Econometrics and Finance; Social Sciences";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Mortara L., Minshall T.;How do large multinational companies implement open innovation?;2011;This paper addresses a major gap in reported research on open innovation (OI): how do companies implement open innovation? To answer this question a sample of 43 cross-sector firms were reviewed for their OI implementation approaches. The study analyzed how firms moved from practising closed to open innovation, classifying the adoption path according to the impetus for the adoption of the OI paradigm and the coordination of the OI implementation. The way firms adopted OI was found to vary according to (1) their innovation requirements, (2) the timing of the implementation and (3) their organizational culture. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Remneland Wikhamn B., Styhre A.;Corporate hub as a governance structure for coupled open innovation in large firms;2019;This paper addresses how the open innovation concept can be applied in large corporations aiming to work with small innovative firms. More specifically, we report an in-depth qualitative study of how AstraZeneca, a global bio-pharmaceutical corporation, designed and enacted a new mode of organizing for coupled open innovation, with an initiative called the BioVentureHub. The governance structure behind this way of organizing is explored and conceptualized, and we also analyse how this structure shaped the relations and the value being collaboratively generated and shared. Theoretically, the paper connects the governance literature with open innovation. From the analysis of the empirical case, we propose a distinct governance structure that we label as a corporate hub, and we distinguish it from other “open” governance forms, e.g. market, network and bazaar governance, and explain the potential value it brings for coupled open innovation between large and small firms. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd;This paper addresses how the Open Innovation concept can be applied in large corporations aiming to work with small innovative firms.

Christensen J.F., Olesen M.H., Kjær J.S.;The industrial dynamics of Open Innovation - Evidence from the transformation of consumer electronics;2005;This paper addresses how the Open Innovation concept, as recently coined by Henry Chesbrough, can be analyzed from an industrial dynamics perspective. The main proposition of the paper is that the specific modes in which different companies manage Open Innovation in regard to an emerging technology reflect their differential position within the innovation system in question, the nature and stage of maturity of the technological regime, and the particular value proposition pursued by companies. The proposition is analyzed through an in-depth study of the current transformation of sound amplification from linear solid state technology to switched or digital technology within the consumer electronics system of innovation. The analysis especially addresses the complex interplay between technology entrepreneurs and incumbents, and demonstrates that Open Innovation sometimes has to be conducted under conditions of high transaction costs. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Huggins R., Prokop D., Thompson P.;Universities and open innovation: the determinants of network centrality;2020;This paper addresses the ‘network’ and ‘open innovation’ paradigms by seeking to examine the factors associated with structural positioning within university–industry networks. Drawing upon a network analysis of knowledge-based ties held by universities across the regions of the UK, it is found that those universities with the most central positions (network centrality) within university–industry network structures also have high rates of relational involvement in activities such as spin-off generation and engagement in externally funded research projects. Some forms of activity, in particular intellectual property protection through patenting, are found to be negatively associated with centrality. Spatial location is largely found to be unrelated to the network centrality of universities. By utilising network centrality as one measure of the open innovation capability of universities, the paper indicates that a range of institutional characteristics and factors tend to either promote or limit the engagement of universities in open innovation practices. © 2019, The Author(s).;This paper addresses the ‘network’ and ‘Open Innovation’ paradigms by seeking to examine the factors associated with structural positioning within university–industry networks.

De Beule F., Van Beveren I.;Sources of open innovation in foreign subsidiaries: An enriched typology;2019;This paper analyzes the drivers of multinational affiliates’ innovation, using a dataset based on the Community Innovation Survey for Belgium. Specifically, we investigate the role of external knowledge sources on foreign affiliates’ research efforts and innovation. We thereby develop an enriched typology by taking both the MNC and the host country perspective into consideration and distinguish between different types of subsidiaries, in order to disentangle differences in the use of knowledge sources between technology exploiting, seeking and creating subsidiaries. Our findings show that technology-creating foreign affiliates are able to tap into a combination of industry-based value chain partners and science-based partners. In particular, a combination of clients and universities have a powerful impetus on the research effort of technology creating firms. Our results also indicate that technology-seeking subsidiaries make more use of collaboration with competitors. Technology exploiting subsidiaries make significantly less use of external knowledge sources and have a lower R&D intensity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;This paper analyzes the drivers of multinational affiliates’ innovation, using a dataset based on the Community Innovation Survey for Belgium.

Hannen J., Antons D., Piller F., Salge T.O., Coltman T., Devinney T.M.;Containing the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome in external knowledge absorption and open innovation: The role of indirect countermeasures;2019;This paper builds new theory and provides supporting evidence to contain the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS) – a persistent decision-making error arising from an attitude-based bias against external knowledge. Conceptually, we draw on the 4i framework of organizational learning to develop a novel process perspective on NIHS. This allows us not only to unpack how and where NIHS impedes organizational learning, but also to identify the key requirements for effective NIHS countermeasures. Importantly, countermeasures fall into two categories: those that seek to change the negative attitude directly (direct NIHS countermeasures) and those that seek to attenuate the behavioral impact of negative attitudes without addressing the attitudes as such (indirect NIHS countermeasures). While the evidence base on direct NIHS countermeasures has grown over the last decade, indirect NIHS countermeasures have received little research attention. To address this gap, we adopt a mixed methods research design composed of two complementary empirical studies – the first qualitative and the second quantitative. Study 1 explores the prevalence of distinct NIHS countermeasures in collaborative R&D practice. Based on 32 interviews and three focus group meetings with R&D employees, we find that a broad array of primarily direct NIHS countermeasures is employed in R&D practice. Study 2 addresses the scarcity of scholarly and managerial insights on indirect NIHS countermeasures by testing the effectiveness of perspective taking as a debiasing technique to contain negative attitudes at the level of the individual. Based on quantitative survey data from 565 global R&D projects, it provides empirical evidence not only for the prevalence and negative effects of NIHS on project success as mediated by external knowledge absorption, but also for the effectiveness of perspective taking as an exemplary indirect NIHS countermeasure. © 2019 The Author(s);This paper builds new theory and provides supporting evidence to contain the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS) – a persistent decision-making error arising from an attitude-based bias against external knowledge.

Findings show that food and drink companies can be clustered into three open innovation modes in terms of their search strategy for external knowledge ranging from limited collaboration with traditional partners to a broad and deep openness approach with a wide spectrum of external sources. Technology pressures emerge as a key driver for greater openness.

Based on an analysis of survey data, it examines the relationship between network ties and innovation. These are considered as the strategic network ties associated with open innovation and the embedded ties associated with entrepreneurial networks. It is found that both strategic and embedded ties are significantly associated with rates of innovation for entrepreneurial firms, although for the former this relationship is driven by a minority of larger or highly innovative firms. Strategic ties are most strongly linked to product and organisational innovations, whilst process innovations are more related to embedded network ties. There is some evidence of complementarity between the two forms of network tie.

Ettlinger N.;Open innovation and its discontents;2017;This paper critically synthesizes empirics and issues in discrete inter-disciplinary literatures to identify ‘open innovation’ as part of an emergent regime of accumulation, overlaying and co-existing with flexible production, and encompassing novel firm-level strategies, new forms of corporate networks, and a disturbing capital-labor relation that informalizes innovative work while cultivating entrepreneurial but self-exploiting subjects. I explain the novelty of open innovation, its genealogy, and the implications for people and conditions of work as much as for firms in a new topology of power relations. I cast the ensemble of strategies and tactics encompassed in open innovation as contingent, continually unfolding, and sometimes chaotic if not destructive for both firms and labor, in contrast to the celebratory tone in the business as well as geography and regional studies literatures regarding its benefits for competitiveness, innovativeness, value capture, and development. Open innovation – the externalization of innovation – entails long-run approaches to innovation and investment that are fraught with problems, prompting the development of short-term tactics to engage the challenges. One short-run strategy, crowdsourcing, bypasses the conventional web of inter-firm relations to connect digitally with individuals of the global crowd, enabling firms to reap the benefits of the crowd's innovative talents, often without remuneration under circumstances that institutionalize informal work. These neoliberal subjects are best understood in terms of multiple subjectivities. I close by connecting the crowdsourcing of innovative with non-innovative work, both of which are parts of the emergent regime associated with new hiring and work practices that usher in new modes of exploitation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;This paper critically synthesizes empirics and issues in discrete inter-disciplinary literatures to identify ‘Open Innovation’ as part of an emergent regime of accumulation, overlaying and co-existing with flexible production, and encompassing novel firm-level strategies, new forms of corporate networks, and a disturbing capital-labor relation that informalizes innovative work while cultivating entrepreneurial but self-exploiting subjects.

Sengupta A., Sena V.;Impact of open innovation on industries and firms – A dynamic complex systems view;2020;This paper develops novel behavioural models of open innovation (OI) for competitive markets and uses them to compare the impact of two types of OI frameworks – open source (OS) and patent-licensing (PL). The dynamic consequences of OI, for both OS and PL, are studied using a complex adaptive systems approach. We examine how profits, technology levels, R&D investment, technology adoption and market structure evolve under each and are impacted by underlying market characteristics. While both OS and PL are found to be equivalent in technology outcomes, OS comes with additional advantages to participating firms. Firms in the OS framework earn higher profit and are more efficient with their R&D investments. The industry is less concentrated under OS than under PL, except when market size is very large. In both frameworks, consumer preference for new product adoption has a significant impact. When consumers adopt newly introduced products relatively quickly, market concentration is the higher and overall rate of technological progress slower. These results contribute towards a deeper theoretical understanding of OI, opening new avenues for future research. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.;This paper develops novel behavioural models of Open Innovation for competitive markets and uses them to compare the impact of two types of OI frameworks – open source (OS) and patent-licensing (PL).

These results contribute towards a deeper theoretical understanding of OI, opening new avenues for future research. ;10.1016/j.techfore.2020.120199;2-s2.0-85087994640;United Kingdom;"Business, Management and Accounting; Psychology";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Naqshbandi M.M., Jasimuddin S.M.;Knowledge-oriented leadership and open innovation: Role of knowledge management capability in France-based multinationals;2018;This paper discusses the links between knowledge-oriented leadership, open innovation and knowledge management in the international business context. Open innovation has become crucial for an increasing number of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to gain and maintain competitive advantage and become a market leader. Despite the recent proliferation of papers dealing with open innovation practices of MNEs, there is limited work investigating the role of knowledge management (KM) capability on the relationship between knowledge-oriented leadership and open innovation. Given MNEs’ growing interest in open innovation, the lack of research on knowledge-oriented leadership and KM capability in the open innovation context is a significant research gap in our knowledge. In response, we conducted a study on the mediating role of KM capability in the linkage between knowledge-oriented leadership and open innovation (inbound and outbound), using data collected from 172 subsidiaries of MNEs based in France. A structural equation modelling approach is employed to study the impact of the latent variables associated with knowledge-oriented leadership and KM capability on open innovation. The results indicate that higher levels of knowledge-oriented leadership can lead to enhanced KM capability and improved open innovation outcomes. That is, knowledge-oriented leadership has a direct, positive impact on KM capability and open innovation. Also, KM capability is found to mediate the linkage between knowledge-oriented leadership and open innovation. This study provides useful insights for managers who wish to enhance open innovation activities in MNEs, and offers useful guidance to international business scholars, encouraging further research in this area. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd;This paper discusses the links between knowledge-oriented leadership, Open Innovation and knowledge management in the international business context.

Holmes S., Smart P.;Exploring open innovation practice in firm-nonprofit engagements: A corporate social responsibility perspective;2009;"This paper examines the concept of open innovation within the context of corporate social responsibility. It demonstrates how the practice of open innovation unfolds in inter-organizational collaborations that involve the voluntary or charitable sector, outlining the findings of an explorative collective case study of eight voluntary dyadic partnerships between corporate and nonprofit organizations in the United Kingdom, which have resulted in innovation outcomes. Two generic approaches to open innovation were witnessed: firstly, a more exploratory approach to dyadic engagement activities that resulted in an emergent innovation process, and secondly, a focused and pre-determined search activity to exploit the resources of the nonprofit partner that demonstrated a more planned innovation process. Two distinct boundary-spanning roles were identified: in dyads exhibiting few organizational linkages, the role was associated with formal responsibilities from senior management to 'manage' innovation opportunities and outcomes. In dyads exhibiting high linkages, there was no such formality; the role was a 'conduit' to facilitate search and exploration to locate opportunities for innovation through idea exchange. Overall, this research demonstrates the value of an open innovation approach driven by the need to address societal and social issues (rather than those purely economic). Such practice broadens a firm's 'search' activities and delivers innovations in exchange for enhanced social legitimacy - acting innovation capital for future enterprising activities and market advantage. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.";"This paper examines the concept of Open Innovation within the context of corporate social responsibility.

Mawson S., Brown R.;Entrepreneurial acquisitions, open innovation and UK high growth SMEs;2017;This paper examines the dynamics of entrepreneurial acquisitions undertaken by UK high growth small and medium enterprises (SMEs). While entrepreneurial acquisitions are increasingly deployed by SMEs, little is known about their antecedents, motivational drivers and organisational outcomes. Drawing on detailed case study evidence from Scotland, the key factor found to be driving these acquisitions was the desire to augment and exploit technological complementarities between the acquiring and acquired firms. Acquisition can therefore be conceptualised as an advanced stage of the outside-in ‘open innovation’ strategies proactively used within these innovative SMEs. Firms executing this strategy typically have an acute propensity for risk, a desire for close customer engagement, effective business models and strong external orientation. The work suggests that greater attention should be paid within M&A theory to the dynamics of these types of smaller scale entrepreneurial acquisitions. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;This paper examines the dynamics of entrepreneurial acquisitions undertaken by UK high growth small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

Ovuakporie O.D., Pillai K.G., Wang C., Wei Y.;Differential moderating effects of strategic and operational reconfiguration on the relationship between open innovation practices and innovation performance;2021;This paper examines the relationship between open innovation (OI) practices (inbound and coupled) and innovation performance in service firms. Specifically, it invokes a dynamic capabilities perspective to propose the differential moderating effects of two forms of reconfiguration capabilities, strategic reconfiguration capability (SRC) and operational reconfiguration capability (ORC), on the focal relationship. Based on a sample of service sector firms drawn from the UK Community Innovation Survey, our analysis shows the positive combinative effects of SRC and coupled OI on radical innovation outcomes and those of ORC and coupled OI on incremental innovation outcomes. The findings of differential moderating effects underscore the need to assess the boundary conditions within which OI positively impacts on innovation outcomes and offer insights to managers on the importance of strategic and operational reconfiguration capabilities for achieving better innovation outcomes from OI practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.;This paper examines the relationship between Open Innovation practices (inbound and coupled) and innovation performance in service firms.

Colombo M.G., Piva E., Rossi-Lamastra C.;Open innovation and within-industry diversification in small and medium enterprises: The case of open source software firms;2014;This paper examines the within-industry diversification of software small and medium enterprises that collaborate with the open source software community (OSS SMEs). In doing so, it offers new insights into the association between open innovation and diversification. We rely on arguments inspired by the literature and evidence collected through interviews with OSS SMEs' top managers to investigate factors that favor or hinder within-industry diversification. First, in line with the mainstream diversification literature, we focus attention on the role of firm size. Second, in the spirit of the open innovation research, we concentrate on the mechanisms that OSS SMEs put in place to get access to the external resources of the OSS community. Econometric evidence on 100 European OSS SMEs shows that firm size is negatively associated to within-industry diversification, while OSS SMEs that have contributed to a larger number of OSS projects have a more diversified portfolio of software products. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that the practice of authorizing firm programmers to contribute autonomously to OSS projects of their own choice during working hours may be positively associated to within-industry diversification only if OSS SMEs possess adequate internal technological resources. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.;This paper examines the within-industry diversification of software small and medium enterprises that collaborate with the open source software community (OSS SMEs).

Masucci M., Brusoni S., Cennamo C.;Removing bottlenecks in business ecosystems: The strategic role of outbound open innovation;2020;This paper investigates how firms can orchestrate outbound open innovation strategically to accelerate technological progress among the firms they collaborate with, thus removing technological bottlenecks in their business ecosystem. We examine how a major oil and gas producer fostered, through its internal corporate venture unit, the development of new technologies aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the oilfield services offered by its key providers. The comparative analysis of five innovative projects suggests that two factors were critical for the successful deployment of the proposed technologies: their potential to broaden service providers’ portfolios and the possibility to retain control over the relevant intellectual property. The concurrent presence of these two factors incentivized service providers to deploy the new technologies, aligning their interests with those of the oil major company. By revealing unexplored aspects of the interplay of inter-firm collaborations and open innovation processes, this paper extends our understanding of how firms can align the incentives and activities of other actors in their business ecosystems by strategizing their open innovation initiatives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.;This paper investigates how firms can orchestrate outbound Open Innovation strategically to accelerate technological progress among the firms they collaborate with, thus removing technological bottlenecks in their business ecosystem.

Jaspers F., Van Den Ende J.;Open innovation and systems integration: How and why firms know more than they make;2010;This paper investigates open innovation for the development of complex products. In this context, systems integrators are firms that integrate component innovations into existing product systems and that design entirely new product architectures. To successfully execute these systems integration tasks, these firms need to monitor and absorb the rapid and diverse technological developments that surround them. Systems integration therefore explains why firms know more than they make. Open innovation, on its part, provides the mechanisms that indicate how firms can expand their knowledge boundary. Open innovation and systems integration are strong complements therefore. More specifically, a contingent and a balanced approach to open innovation is suggested: open as far as abundant component knowledge is concerned, and closed with respect to the generation and exploitation of scarce, internally developed architectural knowledge.

Bianchi M., Cavaliere A., Chiaroni D., Frattini F., Chiesa V.;Organisational modes for Open Innovation in the bio-pharmaceutical industry: An exploratory analysis;2011;This paper investigates the adoption of Open Innovation in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, studying through which organisational modes it is put into practice and how these modes are interwoven with the different phases of drug discovery and development process. Two rounds of interviews with industry experts were carried out to develop a model describing the adoption of Open Innovation by bio-pharmaceutical companies.

Wang Y., Vanhaverbeke W., Roijakkers N.;Exploring the impact of open innovation on national systems of innovation - A theoretical analysis;2012;"This paper investigates the impact of open innovation on national systems of innovation. The open innovation concept has become widely established among scholars and practitioners. However, an overview of its impact on national innovation systems is still lacking. Given that the innovating firm is at the core of national innovation systems, a better understanding of shifting innovation strategies at the firm level is of fundamental importance to the actions of policy-makers within the national innovation systems framework. Based on the main analytical approaches of national innovation systems and the current state of open innovation research, we argue that open innovation practices have at least three critical effects on national systems of innovation: (a) they reinforce its importance; (b) they improve its effectiveness; and (c) they diversify its networks. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.";"This paper investigates the impact of Open Innovation on national systems of innovation.

Chen H., Zeng S., Yu B., Xue H.;Complementarity in Open Innovation and Corporate Strategy: The Moderating Effect of Ownership and Location Strategies;2020;This paper investigates the ownership and location strategies as contingency factors, which affect the relationship between SMEs' open innovation activities and innovation performance in the context of emerging economies. Drawing from the corporate strategy and open innovation literature, we argued that SMEs with state and foreign ownership can more effectively capture economic rents from open innovation in a weak intellectual-property-rights regime. Meanwhile, the subnational environments in which SMEs locate their businesses is also crucial for them to capture value from open innovation. Using the data of 1050 SMEs in China, we found that state ownership positively and significantly moderates the relationship between openness and innovative performance, while foreign ownership partially supports the same effect. By disentangling the pro-business environment and the market development, we found that for SMEs that are located in a region with a stronger pro-business environment and a higher level of market development, open innovation can bring more value than it does for those located in regions with lower levels of those factors. Overall, this paper also contributes to our understanding of the complementary relationships between ownership and location strategies and open innovation. © 1988-2012 IEEE.;This paper investigates the ownership and location strategies as contingency factors, which affect the relationship between SMEs' Open Innovation activities and innovation performance in the context of emerging economies.

Yun J.J., Park K., Gaudio G.D., Corte V.D.;Open innovation ecosystems of restaurants: geographical economics of successful restaurants from three cities;2020;This paper investigates the role of open innovation in the success of restaurants. Our research questions are as follows. ‘Is open innovation a rational strategy for a small restaurant to attract and maintain customers? Which open innovation strategies should a small restaurant use?’ We constructed our research model of open innovation ecosystem of restaurants with ingredients open innovation, recipe open innovation and service open innovation to analyse open innovation in small restaurants, which is a worldwide phenomenon. We chose four successful restaurants from Naples, one restaurant from South Korea, and a North Korean restaurant as our case studies using participant observation, in-depth interviews and semi-structured questionnaires, with the results indicating the following. First, open innovation is essential for the success of small restaurants. Second, if any small restaurant adopts a closed innovation strategy with respect to any of food ingredients, recipes or service, it should choose an open innovation strategy or open innovation platform with regard to the others to maintain its competitive advantage compared to other restaurants in the neighbourhood. Third, an open innovation platform of any of food ingredients, recipes or service, can generate additional revenue by selling independent ingredients or services. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;This paper investigates the role of Open Innovation in the success of restaurants.

Vidmar M., Rosiello A., Vermeulen N., Williams R., Dines J.;New Space and Agile Innovation: Understanding transition to open innovation by examining innovation networks and moments;2020;This paper is building a detailed understanding of the organisational structures and practices in SMEs' knowledge absorption from a network of innovation partners. In particular, it explores the relationship between the openness of innovation process through innovation networks and the development of organisational structures within firms, as well as its linkage to a regional sectoral environment. It proposes a new conceptual tool of “innovation moments”, to synthesise the key theoretical premises of knowledge management, organisational learning and absorptive capacity literatures. In order to study this vital nexus of phenomena, we propose to deploy a novel mixed methods approach of combining quantitative ego-centric Social Network Analysis (Ego-SNA) and qualitative derived narratives of product development experiences via a sensitising concept, to study the emergence and development of the New Space Sector in Scotland. The findings show that the type of the SME – “traditional” versus New Space and upstream versus downstream – is clearly related to the structure of the firms' ego-centric innovation networks and their position in the composite whole network. Furthermore, by using qualitative case study data we show that the firms' typology is also closely related to internal organisational features, in particular flattening hierarchical structures and the formalisation and standardisation within NPD processes. This paper argues that the interlinking of these two elements is poised to describe a cultural shift in the approach to innovation networking and new product development (NPD) process management, understanding of which is a critical element of examining Open Innovation in SMEs. © 2019 IAA;This paper is building a detailed understanding of the organisational structures and practices in SMEs' knowledge absorption from a network of innovation partners.

Spithoven A.;Open innovation practices and innovative performances: An international comparative perspective;2013;This paper looks at firm-level differences in R&D intensity and sales from product innovations. R&D intensity and innovative sales are explained by a model using harmonised firm-level data from the Third Community Innovation Survey for three European countries: Belgium, Germany and Spain. For each country, the average estimates suggest that incoming knowledge spillovers, research cooperation, appropriability and human capital all exercise a positive influence on R&D intensity and, through this, on innovative sales. Quantile regressions indicate that, although there are differences between countries, the joint relative impact of incoming knowledge spillovers and research cooperation tends to increase quantile-wise in relation to that of appropriability. This suggests that strong innovators have a more open innovation process.

Mun C., Kim Y., Yoo D., Yoon S., Hyun H., Raghavan N., Park H.;Discovering business diversification opportunities using patent information and open innovation cases;2019;This paper proposes a method to identify business diversification opportunities for a company. In particular, the method uses M&A cases related to business diversifications to identify atypical diversification opportunities. The underlying idea of the method is that industrial sectors of companies acquired by acquiring companies having similar characteristics with the focal company can be business diversification directions for the company. Industrial sectors of companies are identified by using IPC(International Patent Classification)-ISIC(International Standard Industrial Classification) concordance, and we updated the previous concordance to reflect the recent technological and business environments. For verification of the method, we used a successful M&A case related to business diversification and tested that the method can identify same industrial sector with the case as top priority. The results show that the method identified the same industrial sector as top ranking and other uncommon industrial sectors as recommended opportunities. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.;This paper proposes a method to identify business diversification opportunities for a company.

Cooke P.;Regionally asymmetric knowledge capabilities and open innovation: Exploring 'Globalisation 2' - A new model of industry organisation;2005;This paper proposes to review and assess social scientific debate about the origins and nature of innovation in modern society. It focuses on three sub-sets of conceptualisation, critique and commentary that refer specifically to sub-national or regional innovation systems. Research in the latter field has grown enormously in recent years. Moreover, new perspectives from other disciplines than regional science have been promoted. One distinctive view of relevance in that it is focused on the role in innovation of specific 'entrepreneurial universities' in relation to industry and government is, of course, the 'Triple Helix' approach. This is reviewed and sympathetically critiqued. A second view, less sympathetically critiqued here, is one that itself attacks all so-called 'new regionalism' for stressing the importance of institutions, industry embeddedness and the micro-science of regional economic development. Dazzled by 'Globalisation 1' and the totalising power of 'scale' geographies, this rejection of the worth of spatial analysis at less than the global or national 'scalar envelope' is assessed for its potential insights into weaknesses of the regional innovation systems approach but found wanting in both technical accuracy and scholarly competence. Finally, the state of the art in regional innovation systems research is sketched by reference both to recent longitudinal findings and elaborations into specific technological fields, particularly but not only Bioregional Innovation Systems that help move us towards a newer theory of economic geography in the knowledge economy, based on 'regional knowledge capabilities.' The analysis conclusively proposes 'Globalisation 2', a 'ground-up' knowledge-driven evolution of the earlier 'top-down' multilateral trade institution and corporately driven 'Globalisation 1.' © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Henkel J.;Selective revealing in open innovation processes: The case of embedded Linux;2006;This paper provides a quantitative study (N = 268) of patterns of free revealing of firm-developed innovations within embedded Linux, a type of open source software (OSS). I find that firms, without being obliged to do so, contribute many of their own developments back to public embedded Linux code, eliciting and indeed receiving informal development support from other firms. That is, they perform a part of their product development open to the public-an unthinkable idea for traditionally minded managers. Such openness obviously entails the challenge of protecting one's intellectual property. I find that firms address this issue by revealing selectively. They reveal, on average, about half of the code they have developed, while protecting the other half by various means. Revealing is strongly heterogeneous among firms. Multivariate analysis can partly explain this heterogeneity by firm characteristics and the firm's purpose behind revealing. An analysis of reasons for revealing and of the type of revealed code shows that different types of firms have different rationales for openness. Implications for management are that the conflict between downsides and benefits of openness appears manageable. Provided selective revealing is practiced deliberately, the opportunities of open development dominate. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Developers strongly sort along key dimensions of the business model chosen by project managers, especially the degree of openness of the project license.

The results indicate an important role for intrinsic motivation, reputation, and labor market signaling, and a more limited role for reciprocity.

Remneland Wikhamn B.;Open innovation change agents in large firms: how open innovation is enacted in paradoxical settings;2020;This paper theorizes how change agents in large firms enact open innovation with small firms. The open innovation change agent is highlighted as a key internal actor for the transformational work needed to put open innovation into practice. The paper presents an empirically grounded theoretical model of how these actors work, emphasizing the two activities of ‘anchoring’ and ‘navigating’, with the purpose of bridging the inside and outside of the corporation. In applying a paradox perspective on open innovation enactment, it is explained how these change agents act as both catalysts and guards for collaboration, continuously balancing different paradoxical demands.

Shim S.-O., Park K., Choi S.;Sustainable production scheduling in open innovation perspective under the fourth industrial revolution;2018;This research addresses a specific issue in the field of operation scheduling. Even though there are lots of researches on the field of planning and scheduling, a specific scheduling problem is introduced here. We focus on the operation scheduling requirements that the Fourth Industrial Revolution has brought currently. From the point of view of open innovation, operation scheduling is known as the one that is using the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Big Data, and Mobile technology. To build proper operation systems under the Fourth Industrial Revolution, it is very essential to devise effective and efficient scheduling methodology to improve product quality, customer delivery, manufacturing flexibility, cost saving, and market competence. A scheduling problem on designated parallel equipments, where some equipments are grouped according to the recipe of lots, is considered. This implies that a lot associated with a specific recipe is preferred to be processed on an equipment among predetermined (designated) ones regardless of parallel ones. A setup operation occurs between different recipes of lots. In order to minimize completion time of the last lot, a scheduling algorithm is proposed. We conducted a simulation study with randomly generated problems, and the proposed algorithm has shown desirable and better performance that can be applied in real-time scheduling. © 2018 by the authors.;This research addresses a specific issue in the field of operation scheduling.

Open innovation (OI) has been on the topical research agenda, but the previous literature lacks studies in the service sector and specifically for tourism companies. Moreover, the introduction of social media as a tool to implement open innovation is considered the main research gap. Structural equation modelling is applied to data from 181 Portuguese and Spanish companies to study both customer involvement in new product development and the perceptions and results in terms of turnover and competitiveness. The structure of the relationships between research and development, external openness and open innovation management is highlighted with statistical analysis. In addition, the introduction of social media adds value to the proposed model. Currently, there is a lack of available models to give structure to the OI paradigm and to allow us to manage it. The contribution of this research is a comparison of the explanatory power of three models that allow us to test how certain strategic guidelines in tourism companies influence each other and have a mediating or multiplier effect when linked to each other (nested models method).

Rostoka Z., Locovs J., Gaile-Sarkane E.;Open innovation of new emerging small economies based on university-construction industry cooperation;2019;This research is to analyse the existing cooperation between universities and the construction industry and to investigate what is the most effective model for long-term cooperation between an academic university and the private construction sector. The current article describes the human resources management tools to be used by employers to create interrelations between the paid salaries and productivity, thus providing both individual and corporate results. The suggested different tools contribute to keeping employees satisfied and motivated, simultaneously properly balancing productivity and individual earnings. The researchers conclude that it is necessary to create a new model for personnel selection and a new approach to stimulate motivation and maintenance within the construction industry. In order to respond to the needs of the sector for professionals and the required increase of the qualifications of the mentioned specialists, it is necessary that the country improves the level of education of the future professionals for the construction industry and changes the system of testing their professional qualifications, which means cooperation between the educational institutions and the industry. The suggested cooperation model by authors may provide a general guideline for further detailed researches and its implementation may help similar-sized economies to make possible national adjustments. The implementation of this model in bigger and/or developed economies should be justified by separate additional research. © 2019 by the authors.;This research is to analyse the existing cooperation between universities and the construction industry and to investigate what is the most effective model for long-term cooperation between an academic university and the private construction sector.

Marullo C., Martelli I., Di Minin A.;The many shades of ‘openness’: an application of item response theory to open innovation research;2021;This study addresses one of the most basic research questions investigated in the Open Innovation (OI) literature: how open are firms? This question has remained partially unanswered given the challenges encountered by empirical research in assessing the relevance of specific OI practices within the OI model, as well as the types of activities perceived by managers as OI benefits or concerns. To provide an answer to this question, we suggest a framework using Item Response Theory to improve over current measures of firms' openness and test it on a sample of 383 technology-based SMEs. Our theoretical model conceives openness as an instance of how firms make decisions regarding the adoption of different OI practices based on their evaluation of OI benefits and concerns. Focusing on the relationship between firm-level differences in terms of openness and the types of OI practices adopted by these firms, we show that significantly different levels of ‘OI maturity’ are required to broaden the scope of external partnerships and to shift from non-pecuniary OI modes (relation-based approaches) toward pecuniary (transaction-based) practices. Our results have relevant implications for the OI literature and provide new managerial insight into OI adoption. © 2020 The Authors.

The modern economy can be modeled as Entrepreneurial Cyclical Dynamics of Open Innovation with three sub-economies such as market open innovation by SMEs and start-ups, closed open innovation by big business, and social open innovation. When there is low balance among the three sub-economies, which is to say, if any of the sub-economies is too big, or too small, the economy dynamics decreases, and the economic growth rate slows down to nearly zero or even negative according to the model simulation. South Korea, with a low internal reserve policy, is in this situation. When there is medium balance among three sub-economies, which is to say, any of the sub-economies is big enough to lead the total economy but is not sufficiently big to control totally the other two economies, the economy dynamics increases and the economic growth rate will be maintained at a high level according to the model simulation. India, with its grassroots innovation festival, demonstrates this situation.

Since OA is central to the short and long-term survival of the firm, there is an enormous interest in investigating organisational mechanisms for achieving higher levels of OA. Prior studies have mostly concentrated on ‘internal’ mechanisms, and less attention has been given to how open innovation practices can promote OA. Our observation of 214 Iran knowledge-intensive firms indicates that OI, entailing inbound and outbound open innovation activities, significantly enhances OA. Yet, contrary to our expectation, EO negatively moderates the relationship between OI and OA in the developing context of Iran. This provides compelling insights into how an open innovation approach can compensate the necessity of risky and proactive entrepreneurial activities in the less developed institutional contexts where institutional voids enhance the costs and risks of entrepreneurial initiatives. The discussion finally suggests the theoretical and managerial implications of the study and future directions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;This study aims to examine the relationship between Open Innovation, organisational ambidexterity (OA), and entrepreneurial orientation (EO).

Jeong H., Shin K., Kim E., Kim S.;Does open innovation enhance a large firm’s financial sustainability? A case of the Korean food industry;2020;This study aims to explore whether a firm’s financial sustainability is enhanced by open innovation especially after a global financial crisis. There are few studies on the relationship between open innovation and financial sustainability. This study aimed to fill the literature gap by analyzing the change in the financial ratio according to the increase or decrease in open innovation. We used a case study method regarding large Korean food firms. Korea is a latecomer in the food industry, which is driven by large companies. This study is meaningful for financial sustainability studies of countries with a lack of resources and small market size, which require open innovation. The findings of this study are as follows: The most preferred alliance strategy of large food firms is joint research. In order to secure raw materials and markets, open innovation was actively conducted abroad, which increased growth and profitability. However, a firm which rarely adopts open innovation could grow steadily through internal strategies. On the other hand, although relatively many open innovations have been used, growth and profitability could decrease. Firms with sufficient absorptive capacity strengthen financial sustainability through open innovation. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.;This study aims to explore whether a firm’s financial sustainability is enhanced by Open Innovation especially after a global financial crisis. There are few studies on the relationship between Open Innovation and financial sustainability. This study aimed to fill the literature gap by analyzing the change in the financial ratio according to the increase or decrease in Open Innovation. We used a case study method regarding large Korean food firms. Korea is a latecomer in the food industry, which is driven by large companies. This study is meaningful for financial sustainability studies of countries with a lack of resources and small market size, which require Open Innovation. The findings of this study are as follows: The most preferred alliance strategy of large food firms is joint research. In order to secure raw materials and markets, Open Innovation was actively conducted abroad, which increased growth and profitability. However, a firm which rarely adopts Open Innovation could grow steadily through internal strategies. On the other hand, although relatively many Open Innovations have been used, growth and profitability could decrease. Firms with sufficient absorptive capacity strengthen financial sustainability through Open Innovation. ;10.3390/joitmc6040101;2-s2.0-85093675942;South Korea;"Economics, Econometrics and Finance; Social Sciences";Social Sciences & Humanities;Q1
Mention A.-L.;Co-operation and co-opetition as open innovation practices in the service sector: Which influence on innovation novelty?;2011;This study aims to identify the influence of co-operation practices and the use of internal and external information sources on the propensity of firms to introduce new to the market innovations in the service sector. Data come from the 4th Community Innovation Survey, which covers the years 20022004. A logistic regression model is applied with the degree of novelty of good/service innovation as dependent variable. The analysis of the parameter estimates shows that firms provided with information from market sources and from internal sources as well as firms involved in science-based collaboration for their product innovations are more likely to introduce new to the market innovations, whereas information coming from competitors seems to have a negative influence on the degree of novelty of innovation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Suh Y., Kim M.-S.;Effects of SME collaboration on R&D in the service sector in open innovation;2012;This study analyses the effects of four types of collaborative activities on the R&D performance of service SMEs in the context of open innovation: in-house R&D (non-collaboration), technology acquisition, R&D collaboration, and networking. For this, the study employs data envelopment analysis, a power tool that uses multiple inputs and outputs to measure the relative efficiency of collaborative activities of service SMEs for R&D. The results indicate that technology acquisition is the most efficient type of collaboration for R&D of service SMEs. More specifically, in-house R&D, technology acquisition, and R&D collaboration are positively related to product/service innovation, patenting activity, and process innovation, respectively. However, networking is not significantly related to any three types of R&D performance. In addition, the service SMEs' strategic focus did not match their strategic purposes, suggesting a need for adjusting their collaborative activities. The results have important implications for managers and policy-makers interested in facilitating open innovation in service SMEs through various collaborative activities. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.;This study analyses the effects of four types of collaborative activities on the R&D performance of service SMEs in the context of Open Innovation: in-house R&D (non-collaboration), technology acquisition, R&D collaboration, and networking.

Adam A.M.;Susceptibility of stock market returns to international economic policy: Evidence from effective transfer entropy of africa with the implication for open innovation;2020;This study contributes to the scant finance literature on information flow from international economic policy uncertainty to emerging stock markets in Africa, using daily US economic policy uncertainty as a proxy and the daily stock market index for Botswana, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Namibia, South Africa, and Zambia from 31 December 2010 to 27 May 2020, using the Renyi effective transfer entropy. International economic policy uncertainty transmits significant information to Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, Namibia, and South Africa, and insignificant information to Botswana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia. The asymmetry in the information transfer tends to make the African market an alternative for the diversification of international portfolios when the uncertainty of the global economic policy is on the rise. The findings also have implications for the adoption of open innovation in African stock markets. © 2020 by the authors.;This study contributes to the scant finance literature on information flow from international economic policy uncertainty to emerging stock markets in Africa, using daily US economic policy uncertainty as a proxy and the daily stock market index for Botswana, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, Namibia, South Africa, and Zambia from 31 December 2010 to 27 May 2020, using the Renyi effective transfer entropy.

Lee S.-D., Kwon S.-S.;Carbon sequestration in the urban areas of Seoul with climate change: Implication for open innovation in environmental industry;2018;This study estimates the impact of potential climate change, and human interference (anthropogenic deforestation), on temperate forest carbon pool change in the capital area of South Korea, using a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). Additionally, the characteristics of forest carbon pool change were simulated based on a biogeochemical module. The change of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration is deeply related to the change of the forest carbon pool, which is estimated with the measures of Net Primary Productivity (NPP), and Soil Carbon Storage (SCS). NPP and SCS were estimated at 2.02-7.43 tC ha-1 year-1 and 34.55-84.81 tC ha-1, respectively, during the period 1971-2000. SCS showed a significant decreasing tendency under the conditions of increasing air temperature, and precipitation, in the near future (2021-2050), and far future (2071-2100), which were simulated with future-climate scenario data without any human interference. Besides, it is estimated that the temporal change in NPP indicates only a small decrease, which is little influenced by potential climate change. In the case of potential climate change plus human interference, the decrease rate of NPP and SCS were simulated at 17-33% and 21-46%, respectively, during 2000-2100. Furthermore, the effect of potential human interference contributes to 83-93% and 61-54% of the decrease rate of NPP and SCS, respectively. The decline in the forest carbon pool simulated in this study can play a positive role in increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Consequently, the effect of potential human interference can further accelerate the decline of the temperate forest carbon pool. For the effective reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in urbanizing areas, it would be more effective to control human interference. Consequently, this study suggests that a rate of reforestation corresponding to the deforestation rate should be at least maintained, with long term monitoring and modeling-related studies, against climate change problems. © 2018 by the authors.;This study estimates the impact of potential climate change, and human interference (anthropogenic deforestation), on temperate forest carbon pool change in the capital area of South Korea, using a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM).

Frey K., Lüthje C., Haag S.;Whom should firms attract to open innovation platforms? The role of knowledge diversity and motivation;2011;This study explores how the motivation and knowledge of individuals participating in innovation projects broadcast on the Internet affect their contribution performance. By analyzing a data set that combines information from the content analysis of postings and matched survey data from contributors, we find that extrinsic and intrinsic motivations affect the number of different types of contributions to solution threads. While extrinsic desire for monetary rewards tends to be positively related to the making of non-substantial contributions, intrinsic enjoyment tends to breed more substantial postings, and knowledge diversity facilitates all types of contributions to open innovation projects. This study also finds support for interaction effects between motivation and knowledge diversity. We identify the most valuable contributors as those who combine high levels of intrinsic enjoyment in contributing with a cognitive base fed from diverse knowledge domains. Our research complements emerging findings on the individual performance of external problem solvers in crowdsourcing and broadcast search. The findings will be useful for platform managers striving to attract potentially valuable participants to ensure high levels of substantial contributions to innovation challenges. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.;This study explores how the motivation and knowledge of individuals participating in innovation projects broadcast on the Internet affect their contribution performance.

Le T., Hoque A., Hassan K.;An open innovation intraday implied volatility for pricing australian dollar options;2021;This study introduces the intraday implied volatility (IV) for pricing the Australian dollar (AUD) options. The IV is estimated using the at-the-money one-month, two-month, and three-month maturity AUD options traded in the opening, midday, and closing period of a trading day. The Mincer-Zarnowitz regression test evaluates the predictive power of IV to forecast the foreign exchange volatility for the within-week, one-week, and one-month horizon. The mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error measures are employed to assess the performance of IV in estimating the price of currency options for the within-week, one-week, and one-month horizon. This study reveals four critical findings. First, a three-month maturity IV does not contain vital information for pricing options. Second, IV incorporated information is not relevant to compute the value of options for a horizon of less than a week. Third, IV in the closing period of Monday or Tuesday subsumes most of the essential information to estimate options price. Fourth, the shorter (longer) maturity IV provides critical information to price options for the shorter (longer) horizon.

Kang S., Hwang J.;An investigation into the performance of an ambidextrously balanced innovator and its relatedness to open innovation;2019;This study investigated the relationship between open innovation and the radicalness of innovation. The balance between radical and incremental innovation is an essential part of the ambidextrous use of explorative and exploitative strategies, and this study assumed that open innovation is usually interlinked with explorative strategies and is thus related to radical innovation performance. Accordingly, following an empirical investigation, we demonstrate that the balance of open innovation firms is slightly skewed toward explorative radical innovation. Using the Korean version of the community innovation survey, we show that the relative radicalness that is projected on innovation output exhibits an inverted-U curve. Furthermore, the curve shifts based on the level of inbound open innovation. Our results suggest that there is an ambidextrous balance between radical and incremental innovation while implementing open innovation. In addition, the research results imply that firms placing greater weight on explorative radical innovations need to consider in-depth open innovation strategies. © 2019 by the authors.;This study investigated the relationship between Open Innovation and the radicalness of innovation.

Seven explorative case studies were conducted in an R&D and business context of two large global high-tech companies. The results suggest that if the necessary conditions are met, social media usage increases the transparent, moderational and multi-directional interactions that in turn influence four capabilities for absorptive capacity: connectedness, socialization tactics, cross-functionality and receptivity, a hitherto overlooked capability.

Lee J., Kim D., Sung S.;The eect of entrepreneurship on start-up open innovation: Innovative behavior of university students;2019;This study investigates whether higher start-up intention leads to innovative behavior and whether innovative behavior is increased by the medium of entrepreneurship. This study tested the hypotheses by conducting a survey on students participating in entrepreneurship club activities in university. The results showed that start-up intention aects innovative behavior and has a significant eect on the sub-factors of entrepreneurship, such as innovation, risk taking, and proactiveness. The result of an analysis of the mediating eect of entrepreneurship on innovative behavior showed that all sub-factors performed a partially mediating role. It can therefore be said that higher start-up intention leads to more innovative behavior and that entrepreneurship serves as an important link in this relationship. These results show that increasing start-up intention may lead to innovative behavior and imply that this has educational relevance in cultivating entrepreneurship. However, this study is limited in terms of the generalizability of the results, as the subjects are university students participating in entrepreneurship club activities in Korea. Therefore, more significant outcomes can be obtained in further research by targeting a broader scope of subjects. © 2019 by the authors.;This study investigates whether higher start-up intention leads to innovative behavior and whether innovative behavior is increased by the medium of entrepreneurship.

We propose that, to contribute to open innovation performance, an organisation’s commitment to quality improvement must rely on the combination of its own resources and capabilities and its open innovation partners’ resources and capabilities. Specifically, we examine the moderating role of an interorganisational IT infrastructure and the complementarity of learning styles among an organisation committed to quality improvement and its supply network. Using data from 270 managers of European firms, our results show that the negative effects of quality management on open innovation performance can be overcome by complementing the organisation’s learning style with that of its open innovation partner, particularly, its supply network, and, most importantly, obtaining information technologies compatible with those of its supply network members. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.;This study seeks to explain the influence of quality management on the relationship between Open Innovation and performance.

Data were obtained from two different firm samples (Sample A, on incremental innovation, and Sample B, on radical innovation). The main research results are as follows. First, in considering government support for innovation, Sample B, based on radical innovation, played a superior and stronger role than Sample A. Secondly, for both samples, the cooperation of external firms has a positive effect on firms’ innovative performance, which was positively controlled by the size of the firms. Thirdly, in general, radical innovation requires synergy and a more intense focus regarding the constructs considered therein. This work also adds value in methodological terms, as this is the first research to have tested different models of samples with different levels of radicalism in innovation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd;This work extends knowledge concerning the relationships among Open Innovation, innovative performance and government support for innovation within Brazilian firms.

Randhawa K., Wilden R., Hohberger J.;A Bibliometric Review of Open Innovation: Setting a Research Agenda;2016;Through an objective, systematic, and comprehensive review of the literature on open innovation (OI), this article identifies gaps in existing research, and provides recommendations on how hitherto unused or underused organizational, management, and marketing theories can be applied to advance the field. This study adopts a novel approach by combining two complementary bibliometric methods of co-citation analysis and text mining of 321 journal articles on OI that enables a robust empirical analysis of the intellectual streams and key concepts underpinning OI. Results reveal that researchers do not sufficiently draw on theoretical perspectives external to the field to examine multiple facets of OI. Research also seems confined to innovation-specific journals with its focus restricted to a select few OI issues, thereby exerting limited influence on the wider business community. This study reveals three distinct areas within OI research: (1) firm-centric aspects of OI, (2) management of OI networks, and (3) role of users and communities in OI. Thus far, studies have predominantly investigated the firm-centric aspects of OI, with a particular focus on the role of knowledge, technology, and R&D from the innovating firm's perspective, while the other two areas remain relatively under-researched. Further gaps in the literature emerge that present avenues for future research, namely to: (1) develop a more comprehensive understanding of OI by including diverse perspectives (users, networks, and communities), (2) direct increased attention to OI strategy formulation and implementation, and (3) enhance focus on customer co-creation and conceptualize “open service innovation.” Marketing (e.g., service-dominant logic), organizational behavior (e.g., communities of practice), and management (e.g., dynamic capabilities) offer suitable theoretical lenses and/or concepts to address these gaps. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association;Through an objective, systematic, and comprehensive review of the literature on Open Innovation, this article identifies gaps in existing research, and provides recommendations on how hitherto unused or underused organizational, management, and marketing theories can be applied to advance the field.

Zacharias N.A., Daldere D., Winter C.G.H.;Variety is the spice of life: How much partner alignment is preferable in open innovation activities to enhance firms’ adaptiveness and innovation success?;2020;To adapt to changing technological and market conditions, firms perform open innovation (OI) activities. However, not all firms manage to increase their adaptiveness through OI. Depending on the level of partner alignment, different types of OI activities may thrive or fail. Drawing on social network theory, this study investigates how firms should arrange partner alignment to realize the full potential of highly and weakly interactive OI activities and foster firms’ technology and market adaptiveness and, ultimately, innovation success. Using empirical tests on a multi-industry data set gathered from 181 managers, the results show that firms that perform highly interactive OI activities should strive for high partner alignment to enhance their technology and market adaptiveness. In contrast, firms employing weakly interactive OI activities should avoid high partner alignment, as such alignment lowers the positive impact of these OI activities on both technological and market adaptiveness and, in turn, decreases innovation success. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.;To adapt to changing technological and market conditions, firms perform Open Innovation activities.

ZOBEL A.-K., HAGEDOORN J.;Implications of open innovation for organizational boundaries and the governance of contractual relations;2020;To create value in an open innovation context, firms need to increase the permeability of their organizational boundaries to enable knowledge exchange with a broad set of partners. Yet to capture value, firms also need to consider how to govern their cooperative efforts and prevent unintended knowledge leakage. This paper develops a novel framework for researching this paradox of openness, which combines an organizational boundary with a relational contract design perspective. First, we extend prior literature by arguing that value is not created only by optimizing resource bundles through external search processes (i.e., competence boundaries). Instead, value can be created by managing interdependencies with external parties (i.e., power boundaries), aligning open innovation activities with the organization's identity (i.e., identity boundaries), and coordinating diverse transactions in an open innovation portfolio (i.e., efficiency boundaries). Second, we propose that relational contract design is an important alternative to formal appropriation regimes and discuss how contractual mechanisms derived from a relational perspective can enable value capture in an open innovation context. Finally, we discuss how firms can strategically manage configurations of firm boundaries and contract design via a set of dynamic capabilities. © 2020 Academy of Management.

Tajudeen F.P., Jaafar N.I., Sulaiman A.;External technology acquisition and external technology exploitation: The difference of open innovation effects;2019;To sustain in today's ever-changing and competitive landscape, firms must work within and outside of their organizations' boundaries. Open innovation (OI) strategies such as external technology acquisition (ETA), and external technology exploitation (ETE), can effectively improve the innovation performance of the organizations. Technologies like social media can help organizations to scout for appropriate technology, and source for ideas and knowledge from external sources to support their innovations. Moreover, digitalization can hasten business operations and enhance the innovation process of the firm. Focusing on open innovation (OI), this study takes an integrated approach towards investigating the impact of OI strategies, technology scouting through social media, and digitalization vision on innovation and firm performance. Data were drawn from 153 organizations in Malaysia, and the partial least squares (PLS) method was used to analyze data. The findings revealed that ETE, technology scouting through social media, and digitalization vision have a significant relationship with innovation performance. This, in turn, shows a positive relationship with firm performance. However, ETA does not have a significant relationship with innovation performance in the Malaysia context. This study extends the current literature on OI through the use of specific technology variables, such as technology scouting through social media and digitalization vision to support organizations' innovation. © 2019 by the authors.;To sustain in today's ever-changing and competitive landscape, firms must work within and outside of their organizations' boundaries.

Remneland-Wikhamn B., Knights D.;Transaction Cost Economics and Open Innovation: Implications for Theory and Practice;2012;Transaction cost economics (TCE) has had a strong impact on theories of economic exchange but also on open innovation, even though the relationship is often implicit rather than explicit. In this paper, we highlight what we consider to be the problematic use of TCE in the context of open innovation, suggesting that it has a limited descriptive power and potentially does normative damage to open innovation practice. A case study of the Volvo Group will be drawn upon to illustrate these claims. The case questions the belief that hierarchical control eliminates transaction costs. Also, it suggests that an overemphasis on calculative reduction of transaction costs together with a focus on governance and rationality leave little space for an innovative climate, thus diverting attention away from the creative potential of transactions. Indeed the self-fulfilling prophecy character of subscribing to the assumptions of TCE may not merely limit but actually undermine innovation. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;Transaction cost economics (TCE) has had a strong impact on theories of economic exchange but also on Open Innovation, even though the relationship is often implicit rather than explicit.

Lifshitz-Assaf H.;Dismantling Knowledge Boundaries at NASA: The Critical Role of Professional Identity in Open Innovation;2018;"Using a longitudinal in-depth field study at NASA, I investigate how the open, or peer-production, innovation model affects R&D professionals, their work, and the locus of innovation. R&D professionals are known for keeping their knowledge work within clearly defined boundaries, protecting it from individuals outside those boundaries, and rejecting meritorious innovation that is created outside disciplinary boundaries. The open innovation model challenges these boundaries and opens the knowledge work to be conducted by anyone who chooses to contribute. At NASA, the open model led to a scientific breakthrough at unprecedented speed using unusually limited resources; yet it challenged not only the knowledge-work boundaries but also the professional identity of the R&D professionals. This led to divergent reactions from R&D professionals, as adopting the open model required them to go through a multifaceted transformation. Only R&D professionals who underwent identity refocusing work dismantled their boundaries, truly adopting the knowledge from outside and sharing their internal knowledge. Others who did not go through that identity work failed to incorporate the solutions the open model produced. Adopting open innovation without a change in R&D professionals’ identity resulted in no real change in the R&D process. This paper reveals how such processes unfold and illustrates the critical role of professional identity work in changing knowledge-work boundaries and shifting the locus of innovation. © The Author(s) 2017.";"Using a longitudinal in-depth field study at NASA, I investigate how the open, or peer-production, innovation model affects R&D professionals, their work, and the locus of innovation.

Cheng C.C.J., Huizingh E.K.R.E.;When is open innovation beneficial? The role of strategic orientation;2014;"Various scholars have accomplished a great deal to better understand open innovation effectiveness. Case studies have detailed its performance effects, while other studies showed the effectiveness of an aspect of open innovation, such as collaboration with third parties, external technology commercialization, and cocreation. Though most studies report a positive relation between open innovation and innovation performance, some studies indicate possible negative effects. This has resulted in a call for research on what kind of organizational context suits open innovation best. This study therefore addresses two questions: (1) does performing open innovation activities lead to increased innovation performance, and to which aspects of innovation performance is open innovation most strongly related? (2) what is the moderating impact of various kinds of strategic orientation on the relation between open innovation and innovation performance? In this study, we investigate three types of strategic orientations: entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and resource orientation. In a survey among 223 Asian service firms, we first develop and test a comprehensive measurement scale for open innovation that captures the entire range of open innovation activities, including outside-in activities, inside-out activities, and coupled activities. The final scale comprises of 10 items and indicates to what extent a firm has implemented open innovation activities. Next, we study the relation between open innovation and innovation performance. The results indicate that performing open innovation activities is significantly and positively related to all four dimensions of innovation performance: new product/service innovativeness, new product/service success, customer performance, and financial performance. The impact of open innovation is not limited to a particular aspect of innovation performance; it positively affects a broad range of innovation performance indicators. Though open innovation is positively related to all four dimensions of innovation performance, the effect sizes are not equal. The impact on new service innovativeness and financial performance is relatively stronger. Regarding the influence of a firm's strategic orientation, we find that all significant moderation effects are positive. This suggests that, in general, having a more explicit strategic orientation enhances the effectiveness of open innovation. When comparing the three strategic orientations, entrepreneurial orientation strengthens the positive performance effects of open innovation significantly more than market orientation and resource orientation do. In turn, market orientation has a significantly stronger moderation effect than resource orientation. These findings provide empirical evidence of the context dependency of open innovation.

Lim K., Chesbrough H., Ruan Y.;Open innovation and patterns of R&D competition;2010;We explore the technological evolution of three microprocessor firms between 1976 and 2004. We trace how two initially small entrants (Intel and AMD) competed against a larger and more established incumbent (IBM). We show that changes in interfirm relationships (as reflected by competitive and cooperative events) affect patenting strategies. Periods of increased competition correspond to greater patenting within patent classes in which the firms compete head-on. Periods of cooperation are surprisingly not always accompanied by increased patenting in complementary upstream and downstream areas. Despite changes in competitive regime, Intel and AMD exhibit a persistent dependence upon IBM for technology. Our study shows that small firms can compete against a large incumbent in the product market while being dependent upon external sources for knowledge. We also suggest ways in which incumbent firms operating in such environments (e.g., IBM) might engage with these entrants through co-opetition and open innovation.

Lichtenthaler U., Lichtenthaler E.;A capability-based framework for open innovation: Complementing absorptive capacity;2009;We merge research into knowledge management, absorptive capacity, and dynamic capabilities to arrive at an integrative perspective, which considers knowledge exploration, retention, and exploitation inside and outside a firm's boundaries. By complementing the concept of absorptive capacity, we advance towards a capability-based framework for open innovation processes. We identify the following six 'knowledge capacities' as a firm's critical capabilities of managing internal and external knowledge in open innovation processes: inventive, absorptive, transformative, connective, innovative, and desorptive capacity. 'Knowledge management capacity' is a dynamic capability, which reconfigures and realigns the knowledge capacities. It refers to a firm's ability to successfully manage its knowledge base over time. The concept may be regarded as a framework for open innovation, as a complement to absorptive capacity, and as a move towards understanding dynamic capabilities for managing knowledge. On this basis, it contributes to explaining interfirm heterogeneity in knowledge and alliance strategies, organizational boundaries, and innovation performance. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;We merge research into knowledge management, absorptive capacity, and dynamic capabilities to arrive at an integrative perspective, which considers knowledge exploration, retention, and exploitation inside and outside a firm's boundaries.

If R&D costs are significant and catch-up is key, technology laggards must turn to each other and open up their innovation processes in order to survive. This article uses a real options framework to explain the motives of bitter rivals to engage in collaborative relationships in order to catch up with industry leaders in specific technologies. It shows that ex ante, their interests converge and this lays the foundation of “catch-up alliances”: competitors open up to catch up. However, they often bring vastly different resources to the alliance and, in the process of cooperation, what they learn may cause their interests to diverge. Furthermore, some participants may discount a technology trajectory on the basis of what they learn, and terminate efforts in that area. Therefore, the “road not taken” may be a valuable outcome of the open innovation alliance. This article uses the case of a global alliance in hybrid electric drivetrain automotive technology as the study context, and it analyzes the implications for managers facing similar decisions. © The Regents of the University of California 2017.;What happens when firms in an oligopolistic industry find themselves lagging behind in a potentially dominant technology?

Fleming L., Waguespack D.M.;Brokerage, boundary spanning, and leadership in open innovation communities;2007;What types of human and social capital identify the emergence of leaders of open innovation communities? Consistent with the norms of an engineering culture, we find that future leaders must first make strong technical contributions. Beyond technical contributions, they must then integrate their communities in order to mobilize volunteers and avoid the ever-present danger of forking and balkanization. This is enabled by two correlated but distinct social positions: social brokerage and boundary spanning between technological areas. An inherent lack of trust associated with brokerage positions can be overcome through physical interaction. Boundary spanners do not suffer this handicap and are much more likely than brokers to advance to leadership. The research separates the influence of human and social capital on promotion, and highlights previously unexamined differences between brokerage- and boundary-spanning positions. Longitudinal analyses of careers within the Internet Engineering Task Force community from 1986-2002 support the arguments. © 2007 INFORMS.;What types of human and social capital identify the emergence of leaders of Open Innovation communities?

Enkel E.;Attributes required for profiting from open innovation in networks;2010;When individuals act in open innovation networks, their attributes are specifically crucial in respect of their success or failure to profit from the network. The empirical background of this research was a 16-month investigation of EURADOS, the successful European network for research on radiation dosimetry. EURADOS presently consists of almost 200 members from 52 European institutions in 31 countries. Not all EURADOS members profit equally from its open innovation network. Structural equation modelling provided an answer regarding the personal and organisational attributes that are required to profit from the network in terms of an increase in innovativeness, a reduction in costs and a better fulfilment of tasks in the home organisation.

Rohrbeck R., Hölzle K., Gemünden H.G.;Opening up for competitive advantage - How Deutsche telekom creates an open innovation ecosystem;2009;When, on 21st September 2006, 'The Economist' compared incumbent telecommunication operators with dinosaurs that could soon face extinction, most readers were ready to agree. The mixture of declining revenues and fierce competition was believed to shake the market and soon to dethrone former national champions. However, there are ways to fight that extinction and one way is to open up for competitive advantage. This paper reflects on a case study at Deutsche Telekom, the German national telecommunication operator. The aim of this study is to analyse to what extent the open innovation paradigm has been embraced inside this now multinational company. Using empirical evidence from 15 in-depth interviews, we identify 11 open innovation instruments and detail their value contribution. We can show that Deutsche Telekom has successfully enhanced its innovation capacity by opening up its traditional development process and embracing external creativity and knowledge resources. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;When, on 21st September 2006, 'The Economist' compared incumbent telecommunication operators with dinosaurs that could soon face extinction, most readers were ready to agree.

Laursen K.;User-producer interaction as a driver of innovation: Costs and advantages in an open innovation model;2011;While drawing on theories of distributed innovation and search, we conjecture that because a lot of important knowledge can only be obtained through the use of a product, the use of customer knowledge is beneficial for firms' innovative performance. However, the use of customer knowledge also has an important downside as customers may often be conservative (for many good reasons), forcing producer firms to search for new solutions along established paths, while shying away from truly new and promising opportunities. In this paper these two forces are reconciled through an argument stating that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between the intensity of the use of customer knowledge and innovative performance. We hypothesize that the negative effect at high levels of intensity of the use of customer knowledge is offset by firms' broader search strategies in terms of the breadth of external search among other sources of innovation: If firms search more broadly among several sources of innovation, they are much more likely to enjoy the benefits of customer knowledge, while avoiding important negative aspects. Overall, we find empirical support for these conjectures. © Beech Tree Publishing 2011.;While drawing on theories of distributed innovation and search, we conjecture that because a lot of important knowledge can only be obtained through the use of a product, the use of customer knowledge is beneficial for firms' innovative performance.

Randhawa K., West J., Skellern K., Josserand E.;Evolving a Value Chain to an Open Innovation Ecosystem: Cognitive Engagement of Stakeholders in Customizing Medical Implants;2021;While open innovation ecosystems allow a firm to harness external sources of value creation, these external ties can also constrain its ability to adapt its innovation strategy to pursue new opportunities. This article looks at how an incumbent firm approached such constraints, and used cognitive artifacts to transform its value chain into a collaborative ecosystem. It examines the case of a 3D printing-enabled shift to mass customization of orthopedic medical implants. The results demonstrate how firms can use artifacts to build a shared understanding across heterogeneous stakeholders as they explore and develop new open innovation models, and how this process can be managed flexibly to avoid adopting a locally (rather than globally) optimal strategy. © The Regents of the University of California 2020.;While Open Innovation ecosystems allow a firm to harness external sources of value creation, these external ties can also constrain its ability to adapt its innovation strategy to pursue new opportunities.

Brockman P., Khurana I.K., Zhong R.I.;Societal trust and open innovation;2018;While open innovation provides a new paradigm to sustain a firm's competitive advantage, opening up to external knowledge also entails substantial risks of appropriation and opportunism. Building on this “open paradox” framework, this study investigates whether societal trust—a key aspect of informal cultural norms—serves as an effective mechanism in improving relational governance among partners, thereby leading to better collaborative outcomes. Using a novel panel data on co-owned patents across 29 countries, we show that firms in high trust countries are able to produce a higher level of joint output (i.e., co-owned patents). This effect is more pronounced when perceived opportunism is higher (i.e., firms in high-tech industries, or in countries with less disclosure transparency), and when formal contracts are less enforceable (i.e., in countries with relatively weak legal systems). We further show that open innovation is the channel through which societal trust promotes innovative efficiency. Overall, our study establishes societal trust as a key factor in influencing the efficiency of open innovation. © 2018;While Open Innovation provides a new paradigm to sustain a firm's competitive advantage, opening up to external knowledge also entails substantial risks of appropriation and opportunism.

Zobel A.-K.;Benefiting from Open Innovation: A Multidimensional Model of Absorptive Capacity*;2017;While recent studies shed some light on the performance implications of open innovation, there is a gap in understanding how firms can translate their openness into innovation outcomes. In particular, it is unclear whether—and if so, how—firms can create a competitive advantage in product innovation by tapping into external sources of innovation. To address this gap, this study conceptualizes multidimensional components of absorptive capacity and develops a nomological network that explicates relationships between these components and competitive advantage in product innovation. By marrying the open innovation and absorptive capacity perspectives, higher-order models of absorptive capacity are proposed which delineate the underlying processes to recognize, assimilate, and exploit external sources of innovation. The empirical analysis of the nomological network based on original survey data reveals important findings. First, there is a positive indirect baseline association between external technological resource access and competitive advantage in product innovation, mediated by the firm's technology-related capabilities. Second, components of absorptive capacity modify this indirect baseline relationship. Recognition capacity is positively associated with external technological resource access and therefore, operates as an antecedent to the proposed baseline relationship. Assimilation capacity constitutes a relevant condition to the proposed baseline relationship. The indirect association between external technological resource access and competitive advantage in product innovation is dependent on the level of assimilation capacity. Exploitation capacity has an additional and independent direct positive association with competitive advantage in product innovation. This study contributes to the open innovation literature by delineating organizational processes that help to explain interfirm differences in benefiting from external sources of innovation. In addition, this study adds to the absorptive capacity literature by developing and validating a set of measures that captures, individually and in concert, three components of absorptive capacity. © 2016 Product Development & Management Association;While recent studies shed some light on the performance implications of Open Innovation, there is a gap in understanding how firms can translate their openness into innovation outcomes.

Rodrigues M., Alves M.D.C., Oliveira C., Vale J., Silva R.;The impact of strategy, environment, and the management system on the foreign subsidiary: The implication for open innovation;2021;"With globalisation, there has been an intensification of investments by foreign groups in sectors strategic to their country of origin, such as some minerals. It is, therefore, crucial for a parent company to implement specific controls in its management control systems. In these circumstances, this study aims to determine the degree of control exercised by the parent company over a subsidiary in cultural and organisational dimensions. In addition, other exogenous factors (entities and external factors) influence this system. The results obtained showed that the parent company had an influence on the Management Control System (MCS) of the subsidiary and changed the way control was exercised there, but was unable to deal with macroeconomic instability, environmental and strategic uncertainty, and, consequently, the management risk involved in the extractive activity; in this case, for this subsidiary to operate a seam mine and not be aware of it since it is essentially a commercial, economic group. In addition to these effects on the organisational dimension and the cultural dimension, the shareholders were unable to integrate the subsidiary’s organisational and local culture, which generated some dynamic tension with the expatriate. In addition to the theoretical framework used, it was confirmed that the Flamholtz model is passive to implement in industries in general, particularly in the extractive industry. Finally, some final considerations were made about the management control system, in which the argument is reinforced that there must be empathy between the local staff and the expatriate, as a representative of the shareholders, in order for this system to be a vehicle for the effective transfer of knowledge between both parties, as well as to be supported by open innovation. © 2021 by the authors.

Several environmental experts argue that firms can respond to environmental regulations through innovation; however, the question of how to innovate is unanswered in the environmental literature. Therefore, this study focuses on the open innovation strategy approach to respond to environmental regulations and maintain high productivity by incorporating the idea of innovation management. We first divide open innovation strategy into two modes of external technology acquisition: foreign and domestic. Next, we examine these modes' mediation effects on environmental regulations and productivity. In addition, we test the moderating effect of internal R&D on the relationship between external technology acquisition and productivity. Using data on 35 Chinese industrial sectors from 2001 to 2010, the empirical findings show that foreign technology significantly and positively mediates the link between environmental regulations and productivity, while domestic technology does not.
