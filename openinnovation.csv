Firms use open innovation strategy to explore external knowledge or exploit internal knowledge to benefit their product/service innovations, and thus enhance their innovation performance. However, a lack of relational mechanisms makes it more difficult for collaborative partners to share their knowledge assets. Existing literature lacks a clear explanation of how knowledge and relational mechanisms simultaneously function for innovation success. In response, this study attempts to answer: (1) Can archetypes of open innovation strategies be identified by knowledge and relational mechanisms simultaneously? And, (2) Do they differ in their ability to predict innovation success under the condition of innovation process characteristics? An exploratory study of 78 open innovation firms reflects four archetypes of open innovation strategies. A subsequent cross-industry survey of 248 open innovation firms in Taiwan reveals that the four archetypes of open innovation strategies result in varying degrees of innovation success, and innovation process characteristics positively moderate such associations.;3;Business;Ref001;Q1;2021
Open innovation contests that display all submitted ideas to participants are a popular way for firms to generate ideas. In such contest-based ideation, the authors show that seeing numerous competitive ideas of others harms, rather than stimulates, creative performance (Study 1). Others' competitive prior ideas interfere with idea generation, as new ideas need to be differentiated from the preceding ones to be original. Exposure to an increasing number of prior ideas thus heightens individuals' perceived constraints of expressing ideas and harms creative performance (Studies 2 and 3). Furthermore, creative performance monotonically reduces with an increasing number of prior ideas (Study 4). A final study demonstrates that showing only a limited number of ideas as well as grouping prior ideas offer actionable ways to reduce prior ideas' harmful influence (Study 5). These results illustrate viable ways to improve contest-based ideation outcomes merely by changing how competitive prior ideas are presented.;3;Business;Ref002;Q1;2021
Utilizing the assumptions of the Resource-based theory, this study examined how and why new, rare, and inimitable resources in the form of information proactiveness motivation influence operational firm performance. We hypothesized open innovation as a mediator between information proactiveness motivation and operational firm performance. We also hypothesized the interactive effects of an individual's creative cognitive style and information proactiveness motivation on open innovation whereas climate for innovation and open innovation jointly influence operational firm performance. A temporally segregated data (n = 260) was collected in three-time intervals from employees working in the banking sector of Islamabad, Pakistan. Utilizing the PROCESS approach, the findings of the study indicate that open innovation mediates the relationship between information proactiveness motivation, and operational firm performance. Moreover, the creative cognitive style was found to moderate the relationship between information proactiveness motivation and open innovation whereas climate for innovation emerged as a moderator between open innovation and operational firm performance. This research focused on unique information and contextual resources which directly and indirectly play significant roles in promoting the firm's open innovation and subsequent operational firm performance.;13;Information;Ref003;Q1;2021
"Adequate management of intellectual property (IP) is critical to sustaining competitive advantage and managing outbound open innovation (OI), which describes the inside-out flows of knowledge and technology. This article presents an IP strategic framework comprising the following strategies: a 'defensive' strategy, aimed at avoiding knowledge spillovers and building barriers to competition; a 'collaborative' strategy, aimed at collaborating with other organizations and entering new markets; and an 'impromptu' strategy, which describes firms protecting their IP without a clear purpose. We investigate the relationships of such IP strategies with outbound OI and innovation performance in 158 Italian firms. Most of them declared an impromptu IP strategy. We found that not having any IP protection strategy can be a barrier to outbound OI and that firms with a defensive IP strategy embraced outbound OI more than those declaring a collaborative IP strategy. Finally, firms with collaborative IP strategies outperformed those with defensive strategies.";3;Business;Ref004;Q1;2021
The paper demonstrates how ITRI (the Industrial Technology Research Institute), an internationally prominent non-profit R&D organization, designs a platform-based open innovation system to capitalize on its efforts toward creating economic and social value. We illustrate a holistic framework spanning idea generation to commercialization, and present successful ITRI cases. Detailed actionable descriptions of activities in each innovation stage illustrate the operational implementation of the end-to-end open innovation system. We find distinctive success factors: (1) Managers examine their open innovation strategies and activities by viewing the open innovation process from a system perspective. (2) Outside and inside advisors with investment backgrounds help commercialization planning. (3) A neutral catalyst organization within ITRI is a critical player, maintaining the smooth flow of the end-to-end process. Our findings provide important implications for research and management in open innovation as well as for the systematic commercialization of innovation.;3;Business;Ref005;Q1;2021
Open innovation in medical and pharmaceutical research has grown steadily over the last decade. However, the performance of the published literature in terms of the scientific impact and gaining social media attention remains largely unexplored. The scientific literature of open innovation was examined by means of bibliometric analyses to identify the most prolific authors, organizations, countries, journals, research areas, and recurring terms. By accessing the Web of Science Core Collection and Altmetric electronic databases, citation-related and Altmetric data were evaluated. Public-private partnerships and a selection of newly introduced potential novel drugs in the analyzed publications were identified. North America and Europe were the major literature contributors. Research outputs were mainly published in journals focused on business and economics, pharmacology and pharmacy, and engineering. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies contributed to the analyzed publications, with higher mean citation counts and social media attention (Altmetric score) than nonindustry articles. Public-private partnerships fostered financial support, sharing of expertise and intellectual property, and research collaborations. In summary, open innovation might serve as a powerful strategy to both benefit the involved industry entities and accelerate the development of solutions and products for the betterment of human health.;16;Pharmacology;Ref006;Q1;2021
In the context of open innovation business environments, more and more firms are joining together and creating innovation ecosystems to improve their innovation capabilities by interacting with heterogeneous actors. Yet, there has been little research that has examined the mechanisms regarding how and when firms within such open innovation ecosystems could enhance their innovation capabilities. To address this gap, we propose and empirically test a conceptual framework for understanding the internal mechanisms and contextual conditions in the relationship between a firm's innovation niche and its exploratory and exploitative innovations. Using a sample of 327 Chinese manufacturing firms in strategic emerging industries, we find that a firm's innovation niche within an open innovation ecosystem has a positive impact on its exploratory and exploitative innovations, and we demonstrate that these relationships are mediated by the innovation ecological network. Additionally, we find that the innovation ecological environment moderates the relationship between a firm's innovation niche and the innovation ecological network. Furthermore, we show that the innovation ecological environment moderates the indirect effects of a firm's innovation niche on its exploratory and exploitative innovations via the innovation ecological network. These results not only enrich the research on open innovation ecosystems but also provide important managerial implications for implementing innovation niche initiatives to foster firms' exploratory and exploitative innovations.;3;Business;Ref007;Q1;2021
The aim of this research is twofold: first, to identify Open Innovation (OI) configurations, and second, to analyze which configurations are associated with a high, and which with a low, OI performance. Using a configurational approach (involving complementarity and equifinality), we propose that firms use different OI configurations, by combining three openness practices (high number of alliances, partner diversity, and external R&D) and four complementary organizational assets (human capital, alliance coordination capabilities, inter-organizational learning capabilities, and patenting orientation), and that such configurations affect OI performance. We conducted a survey study on the Spanish biotech industry. A sample of 75 companies was analyzed using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results revealed seven high-performing configurations and six low-performing configurations. Configurations combining one or more OI practices and complementary organizational assets achieved a high OI performance, while open configurations lacking the necessary organizational assets were not successful. Closed configurations also performed poorly. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.;3;Business;Ref008;Q1;2021
SME inbound open innovation has primarily received attention for new product development, overlooking the fact that SMEs may also pursue process or, simultaneously, product and process innovation. We posit that different technological innovation typologies (product vs process) are related to distinct search strategies. Focusing on 3,867 innovative SMEs, results indicate that inbound open innovation is not only related to internal resources of innovation but also to the type of technological innovation chosen by firms. Our results disentangle a rather more complex and comprehensive view of SME inbound open innovation that prevents the fragmentation of results. It is not just about being more or less innovative, but about how SMEs innovate differently, developing distinct internal and external activities.;3;Business;Ref009;Q1;2021
This paper examines the relationship between open innovation (OI) practices (inbound and coupled) and innovation performance in service firms. Specifically, it invokes a dynamic capabilities perspective to propose the differential moderating effects of two forms of reconfiguration capabilities, strategic reconfiguration capability (SRC) and operational reconfiguration capability (ORC), on the focal relationship. Based on a sample of service sector firms drawn from the UK Community Innovation Survey, our analysis shows the positive combinative effects of SRC and coupled OI on radical innovation outcomes and those of ORC and coupled OI on incremental innovation outcomes. The findings of differential moderating effects underscore the need to assess the boundary conditions within which OI positively impacts on innovation outcomes and offer insights to managers on the importance of strategic and operational reconfiguration capabilities for achieving better innovation outcomes from OI practices.;3;Business;Ref010;Q1;2021
The change in business management towards a vision based on open innovation has opened the doors to knowledge transfer between organizations, promoting scientific-technological collaborations resulting in new research that opens the way to new technological innovations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to see how the company Iberdrola has oriented its management strategy towards an open innovation approach, analyzing both its scientific and technological development through a bibliometric and network analysis. The results highlight that Iberdrola has always considered scientific and technological development to be part of its strategic approach as a means of disseminating and transferring knowledge. Furthermore, it can be concluded that the implementation of strategic axes related to sustainable development in an open innovation environment has improved the results of its scientific and technical production, and also the company's financial results.;18;Computer;Ref011;Q2;2020
The purpose of the paper is to identify the most important open innovation practices used by cluster organizations (COs). To reflect these practices, the paper uses the concept of the trajectory of relationship development in COs, applied in the Interizon cluster organization. Additionally, this paper introduces the potential sustainability-related implications of open innovation adoption in cluster organizations. An in-depth direct interview and secondary data analysis were the basic techniques used for data collection. The study demonstrates that cluster organizations can play the role of open innovation intermediaries, implementing a set of different open innovation practices, depending on the level of advancement of cluster cooperation. The use of these practices leads to the development of ever stronger relationships between cluster members, thus conditioning access to the increasingly valuable resources of information and knowledge which are most relevant for the future sustainability-pursuing context. The good effects of multidimensional cooperation in the studied cluster organization prompted the authors to formulate a recommendation for sustainable diversity in the CO. The research goes beyond the state-of-the-art knowledge in the concept of industrial clusters by exposing a broader view on cooperation developed within cluster organizations. The study links the issue of clustering with the concept of open innovation, shedding new light on the processes of supporting knowledge and information flows in COs. Additionally, it contributes to developing a broader comprehension of the context dependencies of open innovation for potential sustainable innovation.;18;Computer;Ref012;Q2;2020
The fourth industrial revolution, termed Industry 4.0, offers a vital and valuable opportunity to drive social and technological innovations. It has state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems and related technological architecture, which can drastically increase a firm's productivity and innovation performance. Nevertheless, Industry 4.0 is also significantly shortening the product life cycles and demanding the pace of innovation to be accelerated. A firm, however, cannot accelerate the pace of its innovation by exclusively relying only on its internal resources. This is the reason firms are increasingly adopting open innovation strategy through collaboration with external stakeholders. The critical challenge that firms are facing while managing open innovation is trust among the stakeholders. Digital trust, attained through Industry 4.0 technologies, can play an instrumental role in promoting open innovation. Against this backdrop, the present study investigates the impact of digital trust on open innovation performance. The study investigates the role of technological orientation and technological absorption capacity in the association between digital trust and open innovation. Cross-country data of 324 electrical and electronics firms of three major Asia-Pacific countries, namely Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand, were collected using a close-ended questionnaire. The study employed partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and PLS-multi group analysis (PLS-MGA) to analyze the modeled relationships. The results reveal that digital trust, composed of trust and Industry 4.0 technologies, has a significant positive impact on a firm's open innovation. Likewise, results also depict a strongly positive moderating role of technological orientation in the association between digital trust and open innovation. Finally, results also exhibit a significant mediating role of both potential and realized technological absorptive capacities in the association of digital trust and open innovation. It is the first-ever study discussing the linkage of digital trust with open innovation. The findings of this study suggest development of technology strategy to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies for accelerating the pace of open innovation.;3;Business;Ref013;Q1;2020
Based on the evolutionary theory of the firm, this paper examines how traditional variables that describe a firm's organizational structure-formalization, specialization, and centralization-affect the adoption of inbound and outbound open innovation. Using a cross-sectional survey of Chinese small and medium enterprises, our study shows that organizational structure matters for open innovation and that formalization, specialization, and centralization have diverse effects on the OI practices implemented by SMEs. Results indicate thatspecializationandcentralizationhave a critical role in open innovation practices as they both foster the use of inbound and outbound open innovation.Formalizationnegatively affects outbound, but it is positively associated with inbound open innovation.;3;Business;Ref014;Q1;2020
"Examining change in business networks can illuminate how time, temporality and process unfold and engage different stakeholders in open innovation. Living labs are increasingly popular open innovation networks that provide a fruitful area in which to study change processes and their influencing factors in network dynamics. We adopt a longitudinal process perspective to analyze eight living labs focused on urban development in a Northern European city. Our analysis reveals six pertinent processes: (i) expansion, (ii) reinforcement, (iii) focusing, (iv) unification, (v) termination, and (vi) recurrence. These processes reflect change in networks characterized by diverse actors, the coexistence of individual and shared motives, a high degree of openness, and user involvement. The identified change processes are a result of living labs disclosing their needs, data, and operations to their stakeholders. We propose a theoretical concept, which we describe as ""network boosters"", to illustrate the factors that foster change processes. Scholars and practitioners of innovation management can learn from these findings that understanding change in open innovation networks may help to depict and predict short- and long-term relationships, and it may assist them in managing innovation in open environments.";3;Business;Ref015;Q1;2020
Open innovation (OI) has gained a lot of popularity in the last decade, as sharing research and innovation efforts offer several benefits for firms and industries. However, implementing a successful OI environment within firms has several internal and external challenges. Therefore, researchers are investigating the factors that might contribute to achieving a successful OI adoption. This paper investigates the effect of management support on the successful adoption of OI. The paper uses regression techniques with data from an OI survey that was conducted in Europe in 2014. Respondents, from several countries and industries, were asked to evaluate their firm's current OI adoption level, as well as, several internal competencies. The dataset analysis results showed that there is a positive correlation between management support of OI and the possibility of successful adoption of OI. Moreover, the results offered insight on some of the dynamics of how management support affect OI adoption.;19;Social;Ref016;Q2;2020
"In a highly competitive business environment, firms are increasingly opening up to external partners and gathering their knowledge to improve internal innovation processes. Although researchers have found that outside-in open innovation (OI) has a multitude of positive outcomes (e.g., improved innovation performance), few have studied its antecedents, and especially the ""softer"" ones. Thus, this study aims to empirically examine three ""softer"" drivers of outside-in OI (i.e., entrepreneurial culture, OI support, and OI enablement), based on a cross-industry sample of 104 firms. The results show that the relationship between entrepreneurial culture and outside-in OI is fully and positively mediated by OI enablement, whereas the mediating role of OI support in such relationship is not significant. This implies that entrepreneurial culture is unlikely to increase the level of outside-in OI, unless firms enable their employees, through systematic training and the deployment of teams, to effectively gather relevant knowledge from external partners.";3;Business;Ref017;Q1;2020
Advanced manufacturing solutions, augmented reality, and cloud and big data are technologies pertaining to Industry 4.0. These technologies improve working conditions, create new business models, and increase both productivity and firm quality production. However, they can also improve life and society as a whole. This new perspective, oriented toward social and global well-being, is called Society 5.0. As has happened for all past industrial revolutions, Industry 4.0 will support the transition to a different society, i.e., Society 5.0. In this transition, open innovation and value co-creation can play an important role. The aim of the study was twofold: to examine how Industry 4.0 features and enabling technologies can support the transition to Society 5.0 and to investigate the roles of both open innovation and value co-creation within this transition. A conceptual framework was developed to jointly consider for the first time Industry 4.0, Society 5.0, open innovation, and value co-creation, which are all challenging issues that firms must cope with nowadays. Managers could profit from these insights to design ad hoc strategies in order to benefit from the opportunities emerging from this transition and overcome the main related challenges.;18;Computer;Ref018;Q2;2020
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to fill a significant research gap in academic literature pertaining to open innovation (OI). To do so, this paper empirically tests the impact of organizational culture, employees' knowledge, attitudes and rewards as antecedents and mediators of OI adoption in organizations, facilitating a more thorough understanding by using an empirical multi-level approach. Design/methodology/approach This paper analyzes the results of the ""Identification of Industrial Needs for Open Innovation Education in Europe"" survey through a quantitative analysis using logistic regression models. This survey includes 528 employees working in 28 different industrial sectors in 37 countries, most of which are in Europe. Findings The results suggest a positive impact of organizational characteristics on the adoption of OI (i.e. including the adoption of outside-in and inside-out OI activities in participating organizations), showing that the openness of an organization's culture increases its likelihood of adopting an OI paradigm. More importantly, the results highlight the positive mediating effect of employees' knowledge and rewards on this relationship. Research limitations/implications The data set that was the basis of this paper was generated in European countries, the results of the analysis are limited and appropriate for this region and may vary when applied to other regions of the world. Practical implications The proposed multi-level approach offers new insight into organizational knowledge. It enables the improvement of OI and knowledge management practices in organizations by assisting practitioners and academics in recognizing the relationship between organizational culture; employees' knowledge, attitudes and rewards; and the adoption of the OI paradigm. Social implications This paper offers a possible explanation on why open-border cultures are more likely to have a successful OI adoption, by relating it to factors that advance in the presence of an open-border culture, such as active participation of OI relative departments in knowledge sourcing and knowledge exchange, and rewarding employees for OI activities. Originality/value This paper presents a new framework which links organizational culture to OI, moving on from merely examining culture in terms of its positive or negative impact on OI adoption. It contributes to research on the OI paradigm and knowledge management by highlighting the significance of antecedents and mediators from a multi-level perspective using multiple units of analysis. Most previous studies focus on a single unit of analysis.";13;Information;Ref019;Q1;2020
Purpose This study aims at developing a better understanding of the relationship between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability and further examines the moderating effect of open innovation. Design/methodology/approach This paper adopts hierarchical regressions to validate the theoretical model and collect the patent data of the top 54 firm patentees in the smartphone industry as empirical sample. Using patent citation network data, this paper estimates the relationship between open innovation, network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. Findings This paper empirically shows that structural embeddedness exerts a negative effect on incremental innovation capability, while relational embeddedness is positively related to incremental innovation capability. And open innovation strengthens the relationship between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. Originality/value This paper shifts the focus of the determinants of incremental innovation capability from internal factors to the external network features by exploring the linkage between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. A counterintuitive conclusion is that structural embeddedness shows a negative effect on firm's incremental innovation capability. Furthermore, in contrast to most previous studies, which only focus on the direct effect of open innovation on the firm's incremental innovation capability, our study examines the moderating effect of open innovation on the relationships between network embeddedness and incremental innovation capability. At last, the results provide practical guidance for firms to occupy the beneficial network positions and adopt appropriate open innovation strategies to improve their incremental innovation capability.;3;Business;Ref020;Q1;2020
This study addresses one of the most basic research questions investigated in the Open Innovation (OI) literature: how open are firms? This question has remained partially unanswered given the challenges encountered by empirical research in assessing the relevance of specific OI practices within the OI model, as well as the types of activities perceived by managers as OI benefits or concerns. To provide an answer to this question, we suggest a framework using Item Response Theory to improve over current measures of firms' openness and test it on a sample of 383 technology-based SMEs. Our theoretical model conceives openness as an instance of how firms make decisions regarding the adoption of different OI practices based on their evaluation of OI benefits and concerns. Focusing on the relationship between firm-level differences in terms of openness and the types of OI practices adopted by these firms, we show that significantly different levels of 'OI maturity' are required to broaden the scope of external partnerships and to shift from non-pecuniary OI modes (relation-based approaches) toward pecuniary (transaction-based) practices. Our results have relevant implications for the OI literature and provide new managerial insight into OI adoption.;3;Business;Ref021;Q1;2021
Open innovation R&D projects involve teams from different organizations, which may affect the team's ability to communicate since people are from different locations and companies, which may have different priorities, procedures, goals, and expectations. To succeed in the project, the team needs coordination mechanisms that facilitate teamwork. However, in the open innovation R&D projects, the coordination approach that fosters project performance is not evident. Using structural equation modeling analysis (PLS-SEM) with a sample of 50 open innovation R&D projects, we assessed the relationship with the project performance of two coordination approaches (organic or mechanistic) focusing on the communication strategies used. We find evidence that both organic and mechanistic approaches are positively associated with performance, which means that each approach has its role in fostering the project's performance. Consequently, such projects benefit both from open, continuous, and informal communication flow and from a more formal procedure of sharing information through a clear definition of project objectives, evolution, and challenges. This research extends prior research on coordinating teamwork for an open innovation setting.;3;Business;Ref022;Q1;2020
Recent literature on open innovation (OI) highlights the need for studies regarding the factors that influence firms to switch from a closed to an OI strategy. At the same time, stakeholder literature points out the scarcity of knowledge regarding antecedent factors fostering collaboration with the firm's stakeholders and their engagement for higher value creation. To fill these gaps, we propose an analytical framework for implementing a strategic OI process through the development of stakeholder engagement. Our framework comprises 17 factors grouped in five levers: knowledge, collaboration, organizational, strategic, and financial. We empirically applied this framework to two industrial SMEs. A qualitative study was conducted based on semi-structured interviews with internal and external stakeholders of both firms. The results show that one company successfully implemented the OI process, while the other struggled to evolve from a traditionally closed innovation model to a more open model. Analyzing the results, we identified several aspects that could explain this difference. These aspects concern the OI activities performed by both firms, the combination of the five levers into a coherent OI approach, stakeholder engagement, and the characteristics of the CEOs. The current study contributes insights for theory and practice, especially as it proposes an original framework for developing a strategic OI process that integrates a stakeholder approach.;3;Business;Ref023;Q1;2020
This paper investigates the role of design as a knowledge translation mechanism for social creativity in technology-intensive enterprises' open innovation practices of. The focus is on how design can be used to connect and combine the contribution of creativity resulting from multiple stakeholders, including entrepreneurs, university students and academics in a process in which knowledge is openly shared and transferred across the boundaries of companies' R&D Laboratories, a university and other institutions. Adopting the research approach of grounded theory, the empirical investigation of an initiative in technology-intensive enterprises, developed from 2009 to 2016 by the Italian Conference of the University Colleges and the Italian Association of Young Entrepreneurs, is presented. The aim is to provide evidence that design artefacts represent important managerial means to support the translation of stakeholders' creativity and knowledge into new formats to nurture open innovation. This provides relevant implications for theory building and practice.;3;Business;Ref024;Q1;2020
This research explores how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) manage external stakeholders during open innovation (OI) processes. To date, extensive literature has explored OI within large organisations, however, there is limited understanding of how SMEs can strategically manage stakeholders during different stages of OI projects. Using a multi-grounded theory approach, 11 cases of SME OI projects were analysed across four regions within Europe. The findings reveal a wide range of primary and secondary stakeholders with varying levels of power and dependency were leveraged across the different stages of the OI projects. A model is presented which advances knowledge on how to map, analyse and manage stakeholders strategically in a SME-OI context. Our research helps advance theory on SME-OI stakeholder management processes and reveals appropriate stakeholder management strategies, which will assist SME managers in alleviating the SME-OI paradox.;3;Business;Ref025;Q1;2020
Extant research has neglected an in-depth examination of the relationship between external knowledge sourcing and the ability of firms to balance radical and incremental innovation activities (i.e., innovation ambidexterity). Therefore, the present paper seeks to reveal the effects of knowledge sourcing activities directed toward three relevant supply chain stakeholders (i.e., suppliers, customers, and competitors) on innovation ambidexterity. Based on a sample of 5897 firms that participated in the Italian Innovation Survey (IIS) (2008-2010), we reveal that sourcing knowledge from suppliers, customers, and competitors has a positive influence on innovation ambidexterity, hence confirming our hypotheses. Specifically, suppliers represent the most relevant knowledge source, followed by customers and, then, competitors. These results expand the literature discussing the relationship between inbound open innovation and ambidexterity performance, which falls short of a clear understanding of whether and the extent to which sourcing knowledge from supply chain stakeholders facilitates achieving innovation ambidexterity.;3;Business;Ref026;Q1;2020
Innovation matters. Business success increasingly depends upon sustainable innovation. Observing recent innovation best practices, the emergence of a new paradigm is traceable. Creating an innovative ecosystem has a multilayer effect: It contributes to regional digitalization, technological start-up emergence, open innovation promotion, and new policy enhancement retro-feeding the system. Public policy must create open innovation environments accordingly with the quintuple helix harmonizing the ecosystem to internalize emerging spillovers. The public sector should enhance the process, providing accurate legal framework, procurement of innovation, and shared risks in R&D. Opening the locks that confine the trunks of community, academic, industry, and government innovation will harness each dimension exploiting collective and collaborative potential of individuals towards a brighter sustainable future. In this sense, the aim of this study is to present how open innovation can enhance sustainable innovation ecosystems and boost the digital transition. For that, firstly, a diachronic perspective of the sustainable innovation ecosystem is traced, its connection to open innovation, and identification of the university linkages. Secondly, database exploration and econometric estimations are performed. Then, we will ascertain how far open innovation frameworks and in particular the knowledge flows unveiled by the university promote smart and responsible innovation cycles. Lastly, we will propose a policy package towards green governance, empowering the university in governance distributed ecosystem, embedded in the community, self-sustained with shared gains, and a meaningful sense of identity.;18;Computer;Ref027;Q2;2020
This paper develops novel behavioural models of open innovation (OI) for competitive markets and uses them to compare the impact of two types of OI frameworks - open source (OS) and patent-licensing (PL). The dynamic consequences of OI, for both OS and PL, are studied using a complex adaptive systems approach. We examine how profits, technology levels, R&D investment, technology adoption and market structure evolve under each and are impacted by underlying market characteristics. While both OS and PL are found to be equivalent in technology outcomes, OS comes with additional advantages to participating firms. Firms in the OS framework earn higher profit and are more efficient with their R&D investments. The industry is less concentrated under OS than under PL, except when market size is very large. In both frameworks, consumer preference for new product adoption has a significant impact. When consumers adopt newly introduced products relatively quickly, market concentration is the higher and overall rate of technological progress slower. These results contribute towards a deeper theoretical understanding of OI, opening new avenues for future research.;3;Business;Ref028;Q1;2020
"Based on previous research on open innovation and appropriability strategies, using knowledge production functions and evolutionary game methods, this paper describes the process of dynamic cooperation between open innovation platforms and their participants. This paper specifically analyzes the influence of open innovation platform's knowledge appropriability/knowledge sharing strategies, as well as participants' exit/nonexit strategy, on the cooperative relationship. Through simulation analysis, this paper draws the following conclusions: first, the knowledge appropriability strategy of the open innovation platform and the participant's nonexit strategy is an important strategic point of the cooperation between open innovation platforms and participants; second, the amount of knowledge production affects the strategic choices of open innovation platforms, while the knowledge increment affects the strategic choices of participants; third, the appreciation coefficient of complementary assets determines the direction of evolution of the cooperation process.";8;Engineering;Ref029;Q2;2020
Purpose This paper aims to identify the prominent themes of open innovation for sustainability (OIS) and establish their inter-relationships. Moreover, it examines the importance of success factors (i.e. knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure) and their configuration for co-creating shared value for OIS in manufacturing micro small and medium enterprises. Design/methodology/approach The first stage of investigation determines the relationship between concepts using the bibliometric technique. The second stage examines predictors (e.g. knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure) that contribute to the desired outcomes (creation of shared value in OIS) through necessary condition analysis. Findings The investigation demonstrates that all three conditions are necessary for (at different levels) creating shared values for OIS. More specifically, the investigation shows that the different levels of creation of shared value outcomes do require organizations to configure organizational interventions at different levels of the knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure. Practical implications To use the concept of open innovation (OI), organizations need to expand their view beyond their existing resource pool and business environment, to include their partners and stakeholders for more inclusivity. Such creation of shared value for OI does require active participation, interaction and collaboration with both manufacturer, retailers and other stakeholders, for developing an insight in creating value for sustainability problem-solving context. Originality/value The investigation advances the existing body of knowledge that propagates the significance of knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure as the antecedent to increase the creation of shared value for sustainability by organizations. The investigation advances the existing body of knowledge that propagates the significance of knowledge management system, openness and organizational structure as an antecedent to increase the creation of shared value for sustainability by organizations.;13;Information;Ref030;Q1;2020
In an open innovation environment, it is meaningful for manufacturing enterprises targeting global markets to integrate qualified innovation resources. In this paper, the linkage between product modularity and open innovation is first discussed, revealing a role that modular product architecture plays in linking enterprises' innovation requirements and innovation resources as external innovation inputs. Next, indices for evaluating external innovation resources are developed. An evaluation method based on fuzzy distance is then proposed, which is intended to select optimal resources for the core modules of modular product architecture. A modular product of Haier Group is used as a typical case to verify the proposed method. Consistent evaluation results of innovation resources are achieved for different decision-making attitudes. Another finding regarding the case enterprise is that the resource management mechanisms it employs lead to a win-win cooperative relationship with its partners.;14;Mathematics;Ref031;Q4;2020
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to shed light on how family firms execute open innovation strategies by managing internal and external knowledge flows (KF) to provide a deeper understanding of family firms' ability to innovate through traditions and create value across generations. Design/methodology/approach Empirical evidence was collected using an online survey of a sample of 208 Apulian entrepreneurs, who were members of the association of young entrepreneurs of Confindustria in the Apulia region (southern Italy). Findings The study derives a model that explains the most relevant factors behind the innovation processes developed by young entrepreneurs in family firms: network membership benefits; KF; track record of innovation; and the entrepreneurial attitude of employees. Research limitations/implications By integrating insights from different research streams, namely, innovation management, open innovation and family firms, the study provides a novel contribution to the open innovation process in family firms. Practical implications The study offers interpretative lenses for entrepreneurs and managers to understand the most suitable knowledge transfer process for encouraging open innovation in family firms, taking into consideration young entrepreneurs' traditions and interpersonal skills, the KF in local ecosystems and network benefits as the main variables supporting the innovation process. Originality/value This study creates a link between open innovation and family firm research by providing an empirically grounded model illustrating how the innovation process is realized in family firms.";3;Business;Ref032;Q1;2020
Although technological acquisitions have attracted much attention as a prominent means of open innovation that allows firms to complement internal innovation, their shareholder value creation effects should be influenced by whether the acquiring family businesses can successfully realize technological synergies. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether market participants perceive family businesses to create more value when undertaking technological acquisitions. Using a sample of 614 acquisitions by 71 family businesses between 2000 and 2014 in South Korea, an event study methodology is adopted. Empirical analysis yields strong support for the prediction that the stock market does not perceive family businesses to be able to create superior synergy through technological acquisitions compared to when they undertake nontechnological acquisitions. The competitive landscape also has implications for the shareholder value creation effects of technological acquisitions by family businesses. Overall, the findings of this paper provide insight into the shareholder wealth implications of technological acquisitions undertaken by family businesses.;18;Computer;Ref033;Q2;2020
This study investigates the positive effects of an appropriability regime and perceived similarity to green co-innovation performance when considering green open innovation activities as the mediator. It proposes a novel construct, i.e., green open innovation activities, and employs structural equation modeling to test its hypotheses. 190 valid questionnaires were collected from executives in Taiwanese manufacturing companies. Manufacturing activities are regarded as a major source of pollution. Consequently, given the broad concern for the environment among governments and consumers, adopting green practices has become critical for manufacturing companies. All the proposed hypotheses were supported by the analysis results. An appropriability regime is positively associated with green open innovation activities and green co-innovation performance. Perceived similarity is positively associated with green open innovation activities and green co-innovation performance. Moreover, green open innovation activities are positively associated with green co-innovation performance. A major finding is that if a company introduces one, the longer the duration of a green project is, the stronger the green open innovation activities and green co-innovation performance are. This study aimed to determine the simultaneous effects of both factors, i.e., appropriability regime, and perceived similarity on green open innovation activities and green co-innovation performance. The contribution of this study highlights the simultaneous importance of appropriability regimes and perceived similarity to determine a company's green practices. While companies have tended to increase their green co-innovation performance, they need to improve their appropriability regime, perceived similarity, and green open innovation activities.;9;Environmental;Ref034;Q2;2020
Leveraging external sources of knowledge has become a vital element of innovation strategy, especially in emerging markets, where many firms lack the sophisticated knowledge required to innovate. However, extant research in this domain puts little emphasis on emerging economies and also typically treats openness as a firm-level concept. In contrast, this study investigates how individual employees rely on both internal and external knowledge to increase their innovative work output (and, secondarily, their customer acquisition performance) and how their supervising manager's characteristics moderate these mechanisms. Using hierarchical linear modeling of data collected from 123 employees and 50 managers in telecommunications companies in the emerging market of Vietnam, we find support for our hypothesized relationships. These findings have important implications for research and practice as they highlight the role of the individual employee in open innovation, the need for considering a more distributed set of organizational functions, and the relevance for emerging markets.;3;Business;Ref035;Q1;2020
To adapt to changing technological and market conditions, firms perform open innovation (OI) activities. However, not all firms manage to increase their adaptiveness through OI. Depending on the level of partner alignment, different types of OI activities may thrive or fail. Drawing on social network theory, this study investigates how firms should arrange partner alignment to realize the full potential of highly and weakly interactive OI activities and foster firms' technology and market adaptiveness and, ultimately, innovation success. Using empirical tests on a multi-industry data set gathered from 181 managers, the results show that firms that perform highly interactive OI activities should strive for high partner alignment to enhance their technology and market adaptiveness. In contrast, firms employing weakly interactive OI activities should avoid high partner alignment, as such alignment lowers the positive impact of these OI activities on both technological and market adaptiveness and, in turn, decreases innovation success.;3;Business;Ref036;Q1;2020
Despite the wealth of research on open innovation, the mechanisms that enable capturing value through adopting an open innovation approach remain largely unexplored. In this study, we focus on open innovation processes among firms and radical circles and shed light on the related value capture mechanisms. We rely on a detailed qualitative case analysis of collaborations between firms and three radical circles (i.e., Slow Food, Memphis, and the Free Software Foundation). Our case studies highlight that the firms captured value from collaborating with these radical circles through developing internal assets (reputational, organizational, intellectual and human, and technological) and new business models. Starting from these insights, the study offers several contributions to open innovation research as well as interesting avenues for future inquiry into this topic.;3;Business;Ref037;Q1;2020
Purpose Business process management (BPM) supports the creation and capture of firm value. In a dynamic context, the current approach to BPM appears to be limited and static in the face of the challenges posed by the firm's open innovation (OI) ecosystem. The main purpose of this paper is to shed light on the value co-creation through the integration of OI principles and mechanisms of value system. Design/methodology/approach To this aim, the paper suggested a conceptual integration of strategy and operations literature on OI and the firm's value creation system. This analysis adopted BPM lenses with specific attention to the alignment between value creation and value capture. Applying BPM lenses to the process of creating shared value sought the attainment of a comprehensive system of decisions articulated between strategy and operations. Findings The paper pinpoints key links between strategy models and operational planning, thus proposing a new framework that integrates the characteristics of value system and OI. The paper elaborates a new theoretical framework rooted in the extant literature conducted in BPM, business strategy and business model innovation (BMI) fields. Originality/value This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature in which strategy models are separately treated from the operational ones. This conceptual effort contributes to the extant literature by drawing upon a comprehensive frameworkand mapping the complex set of interactions between the firm's value chain and its innovation ecosystem.;3;Business;Ref038;Q1;2020
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study how the online temporary crowd shares knowledge in a way that fosters the integration of their diverse knowledge. Having the crowd integrate its knowledge to offer solution-ideas to ill-structured problems posed by organizations is one of the desired outcomes of crowd-based open innovation because, by integrating others' knowledge, the ideas are more likely to consider the many divergent issues related to solving the ill-structured problem. Unfortunately, the diversity of knowledge content offered by heterogeneous specialists in the online temporary crowd makes integration difficult, and the lean social context of the crowd makes extensive dialogue to resolve integration issues impractical. The authors address this issue by exploring theoretically how the manner in which interaction is organically conducted during open innovation challenges enables the generation of integrative ideas. The authors hypothesize that, as online crowds organically share knowledge based upon successful pro-socially motivated interaction, they become more productive in generating integrative ideas. Design/methodology/approach Using a multilevel mixed-effects model, this paper analyzed 2,244 posts embedded in 747 threads with 214 integrative ideas taken from 10 open innovation challenges. Findings Integrative ideas were more likely to occur after pro-socially motivated interactions. Research limitations/implications Ideas that integrate knowledge about the variety of issues that relate to solving an ill-structured problem are desired outcomes of crowd-based open innovation challenges. Given that members of the crowd in open innovation challenges rarely engage in dialogue, a new theory is needed to explain why integrative ideas emerge at all. The authors' adaptation of pro-social motivation interaction theory helps to provide such a theoretical explanation. Practitioners of crowd-based open innovation should endeavor to implement systems that encourage the crowd members to maintain a high level of activeness in pro-socially motivated interaction to ensure that their knowledge is integrated as solutions are generated. Originality/value The present study extends the crowd-based open innovation literature by identifying new forms of social interaction that foster more integrated ideas from the crowd, suggesting the mitigating role of pro-socially motivated interaction in the negative relationship between knowledge diversity and knowledge integration. This study fills in the research gap in knowledge management research describing a need for conceptual frameworks explaining how to manage the increasing complexity of knowledge in the context of crowd-based collaboration for innovation.;13;Information;Ref039;Q1;2020
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate how R&D originality functions in an open innovation process after the introduction of knowledge spillovers (KSs). Design/methodology/approach To examine the research framework, the authors use hierarchical regression based on questionnaire data from 211 emerging enterprises in China. Findings Consistent with the proposed framework, the authors find that the KS effect mediates the positive relationship between openness and innovation performance. In addition, R&D originality weakens the impact of the KS effect on innovation performance. Research limitations/implications One limitation is that the questionnaire survey the authors choose for data collection has some natural defects; furthermore, the testing method and research framework need to be improved. Practical implications Several implications of the findings for managerial practices are discussed. Originality/value First, the research expands the existing theoretical construct by introducing the KS effect into the open innovation process; second, the authors reveal the negative impact of R&D originality on the open innovation process.";3;Business;Ref040;Q2;2020
To create value in an open innovation context, firms need to increase the permeability of their organizational boundaries to enable knowledge exchange with a broad set of partners. Yet to capture value, firms also need to consider how to govern their cooperative efforts and prevent unintended knowledge leakage. This paper develops a novel framework for researching this paradox of openness, which combines an organizational boundary with a relational contract design perspective. First, we extend prior literature by arguing that value is not created only by optimizing resource bundles through external search processes (i.e., competence boundaries). Instead, value can be created by managing interdependencies with external parties (i.e., power boundaries), aligning open innovation activities with the organization's identity (i.e., identity boundaries), and coordinating diverse transactions in an open innovation portfolio (i.e., efficiency boundaries). Second, we propose that relational contract design is an important alternative to formal appropriation regimes and discuss how contractual mechanisms derived from a relational perspective can enable value capture in an open innovation context. Finally, we discuss how firms can strategically manage configurations of firm boundaries and contract design via a set of dynamic capabilities.;3;Business;Ref041;Q1;2020
This study aims at developing a better understanding of the relationship between open innovation and innovation radicalness and further examines the moderating effect of network embeddedness. The paper collects patent data from four emerging industries, 3D printing, augmented reality and virtual reality, hybrid electric vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles, to validate the theoretical model. The results show that open innovation exerts positive effects on innovation radicalness depending on the breadth and depth of openness. Furthermore, network centrality plays a negative moderating role in the relationship between open innovation and innovation radicalness whereas network reach positively moderates the relationship. This study provides a valuable theoretical framework of innovation radicalness determinants by connecting open innovation theory with a network embeddedness perspective. The findings presented in the paper provide practical implications for firms in emerging industries to implement effective open innovation strategies and develop a better understanding of the effect of network embeddedness on innovation radicalness.;19;Social;Ref042;Q2;2020
Due to recent advancements in industrialization, climate change and overpopulation, air pollution has become an issue of global concern and air quality is being highlighted as a social issue. Public interest and concern over respiratory health are increasing in terms of a high reliability of a healthy life or the social sustainability of human beings. Air pollution can have various adverse or deleterious effects on human health. Respiratory diseases such as asthma, the subject of this study, are especially regarded as 'directly affected' by air pollution. Since such pollution is derived from the combined effects of atmospheric pollutants and meteorological environmental factors, and it is not easy to estimate its influence on feasible respiratory diseases in various atmospheric environments. Previous studies have used clinical and cohort data based on relatively a small number of samples to determine how atmospheric pollutants affect diseases such as asthma. This has significant limitations in that each sample of the collections is likely to produce inconsistent results and it is difficult to attempt the experiments and studies other than by those in the medical profession. This study mainly focuses on predicting the actual asthmatic occurrence while utilizing and analyzing the data on both the atmospheric and meteorological environment officially released by the government. We used one of the advanced analytic models, often referred to as the vector autoregressive model (VAR), which traditionally has an advantage in multivariate time-series analysis to verify that each variable has a significant causal effect on the asthmatic occurrence. Next, the VAR model was applied to a deep learning algorithm to find a prediction model optimized for the prediction of asthmatic occurrence. The average error rate of the hybrid deep neural network (DNN) model was numerically verified to be about 8.17%, indicating better performance than other time-series algorithms. The proposed model can help streamline the national health and medical insurance system and health budget management in South Korea much more effectively. It can also provide efficiency in the deployment and management of the supply and demand of medical personnel in hospitals. In addition, it can contribute to the promotion of national health, enabling advance alerts of the risk of outbreaks by the atmospheric environment for chronic asthma patients. Furthermore, the theoretical methodologies, experimental results and implications of this study will be able to contribute to our current issues of global change and development in that the meteorological and environmental data-driven, deep-learning prediction model proposed hereby would put forward a macroscopic directionality which leads to sustainable public health and sustainability science.;18;Computer;Ref043;Q2;2020
Embracing outside-in open innovation (OI) can result in a plethora of organizational advantages, including improved innovation performance. Although some studies have found that outside-in OI improves innovation performance, others have shown that it has no effect or even a negative effect. This mixed empirical evidence leads to a need to unpack the relationship between outside-in OI and innovation performance, and to examine how certain key mediating variables related to the outside-in OI process can ensure that outside-in OI turns into improved innovation performance. Thus, this paper aims to examine the influence of outside-in OI on innovation performance considering the mediating roles of knowledge sharing and innovation strategy. This paper draws on a cross-industrial sample of 112 firms. Data are analyzed using a set of ordinary-least-squares regression models and the bootstrap procedure. Results show that knowledge sharing and innovation strategy fully mediate the relationship between outside-in OI and innovation performance.;3;Business;Ref044;Q1;2020
This paper investigates the ownership and location strategies as contingency factors, which affect the relationship between SMEs' open innovation activities and innovation performance in the context of emerging economies. Drawing from the corporate strategy and open innovation literature, we argued that SMEs with state and foreign ownership can more effectively capture economic rents from open innovation in a weak intellectual-property-rights regime. Meanwhile, the subnational environments in which SMEs locate their businesses is also crucial for them to capture value from open innovation. Using the data of 1050 SMEs in China, we found that state ownership positively and significantly moderates the relationship between openness and innovative performance, while foreign ownership partially supports the same effect. By disentangling the pro-business environment and the market development, we found that for SMEs that are located in a region with a stronger pro-business environment and a higher level of market development, open innovation can bring more value than it does for those located in regions with lower levels of those factors. Overall, this paper also contributes to our understanding of the complementary relationships between ownership and location strategies and open innovation.;3;Business;Ref045;Q1;2020
"Identifying promising technologies using patents has long been a popular topic in the technology forecasting field. In relevant studies, promising technology has been defined as patents having significant impacts on subsequent patents; thus, such patents were identified based on their expected citation frequencies. However, within the paradigm of open innovation, various perspectives, such as commercial and technological impacts, need to be considered in assessing promising technology. Therefore, this study aims to investigate patent information that can be used to assess a patents potential as a promising technology in terms of three criteria: technological impact, standardization, and licensing. Here, the focus was on ex ante information, a set of information provided at the point of application, on which seven indicators showing the invention characteristics were designed. Then, the telecommunications sector was selected as the target industry, and we collected data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The research findings are expected to contribute to the existing body of knowledge on patent analysis by offering a broader view of promising patents. Practically, these findings can suggest valuable implications for decision makers in charge of R&D planning in the telecommunications sector within the paradigm of open innovation.";3;Business;Ref046;Q1;2020
"Purpose This study aims to explore the impact of high-performance work systems (HPWS) on open innovation and the moderating role of information technology (IT) capability on the relationship between HPWS and open innovation. Design/methodology/approach This study conducted a questionnaire survey in the industrial parks of the Yangzi River Delta in China and obtained 108 useful responses. Findings HPWS positively impacts open innovation. IT exploration capability strengthens the relationship between HPWS and open innovation, whereas IT exploitation capability and ambidexterity do not strengthen such relationship. Research limitations/implications Firms should use HPWS to improve employees' motivation of external learning and searching for enhancing innovation openness. They should acknowledge the enabling role of IT exploration capability in facilitating employees' learning and searching toward open innovation and discreetly develop IT exploitation capability and ambidexterity during external knowledge searching, which may not achieve the desired facilitation purpose. Originality/value This study contributes to human resource management (HRM) by suggesting that a new antecedent, which is HPWS in our case, should be taken into account when considering the influence of HRM in the process of open innovation. This study has important implications for HPWS, IT capability and open innovation; open innovation can be improved by using HPWS and IT capability. This study also expands IT ambidexterity to HRM and innovation studies.";5;Computer;Ref047;Q1;2020
The aim of this paper is to explore open innovation (OI) implementation and its impact on firm innovation performance in sectors experiencing technological discontinuities. The paper employs the framework of inbound, outbound and coupled OI to identify processes reflecting sourcing, externalising and exchanging knowledge across organisational boundaries on upstream and downstream innovation activities and explores their impact on the innovation performance of new and established technology firms. The empirical setting is the UK bio-pharmaceuticals sector during 1991 and 2001, a paradigmatic era of discontinous change and intensified OI implementation. First, our findings show that new technology firms (NTFs) and established technology firms (ETFs) differ in their extent and patterns of inbound, outbound and coupled OI, reflecting that they implement OI to manage their competences in light of technological change. Second, we identify a complex and multifaceted relationship between OI and patenting performance, with NTFs experiencing enhanced performance from some OI processes while ETFs experiencing challenges. The paper suggests that delineating OI into inbound, outbound and coupled, along upstream and downstream activities, offers a deeper understanding of the role of OI in innovation, guiding selective implementation in pursuing enhanced innovation performance during periods of discontinuous technological change.;3;Business;Ref048;Q1;2021
How do organizations use the experience from projects to build a systematic capability to manage open innovation projects? Drawing upon Project Management and Open Innovation capability-building frameworks, we studied the crusade of an industrial company to create an open innovation capability. In that sense, we applied an Event Structure Analysis (ESA) to evaluate the event network, which evidenced a four-stage process: closed mode, open driver, vanguard project, project-to-organization. Results demonstrate, from causal connections, that the referred capability can be leveraged from the execution of key projects, especially from a vanguard project. Our study contributes to Project Management theory by reveling that previous experiences in both project and organizational levels offer a fertile ground for the emergence of a vanguard project. For the open innovation field, this paper provides a project-oriented approach to the discussion of open innovation's adoption in mature firms.;3;Business;Ref049;Q1;2020
Covid-19 has severely tested our public health systems. Recovering from Covid-19 will soon test our economic systems. Innovation will have an important role to play in recovering from the aftermath of the coronavirus. This article discusses both how to manage innovation as part of that recovery, and also derives some lessons from how we have responded to the virus so far, and what those lessons imply for managing innovation during the recovery.;3;Business;Ref050;Q1;2020
We propose a game-theoretic approach to examine several possible coalition strategies in a four-echelon supply chain consisting of a supplier, manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer. A solitude model is used to probe the role of learning in quality improvements, and experimental design is conducted to evaluate all possible supply chain coalition strategies between echelons. The novelty of this study is the comprehensive evaluation of knowledge-sharing strategies in collaborative supply chains. The results confirm that the Delta model with a coalition among a supplier, manufacturer, and retailer is the best strategy.;3;Business;Ref051;Q3;2020
Purpose Despite the rising interest in eco-innovation, few studies have examined how open innovation (OI) actually increases eco-innovation performance. Drawing on capabilities theory, this study aims to investigate how two specific organizational capabilities (alliance management capability and absorptive capacity) individually complement OI strategies (inbound and outbound) to increase eco-innovation performance, while taking into consideration high and low levels of environmental uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach To test the hypotheses, the authors used a primary survey and secondary proxy data sources from 232 Taiwan-based manufacturing firms. The authors collected survey data for measuring OI strategies, followed by secondary proxy data for measuring alliance management capability, absorptive capacity, environmental uncertainty and eco-innovation performance. Findings The results indicate that in highly dynamic environments, alliance management capability complements inbound/outbound strategies to increase eco-innovation performance. However, absorptive capacity complements only inbound strategies, not outbound strategies. Practical implications These findings have important implications for managers attempting to increase eco-innovation performance by using OI in dynamic environments. Social implications The findings provide new evidence that configurations of OI alone are not enough for increasing eco-innovation performance. Instead, firms' eco-innovation benefits more when OI are complemented by alliance management capability. Originality/value This study makes an original contribution to the eco-innovation literature by demonstrating how organizational capabilities complement OI to increase eco-innovation performance in dynamic environments.;3;Business;Ref052;Q1;2020
The paper intends to examine the mediating role of intellectual capital in the relation between the openness of service companies' search strategies and thr innovation performance. It models the relationship between external search strategies of open innovation and proposes how intellectual capital matters for openness strategies in the service industries. Moreover, the paper intends to expand the field of open innovation through exploring the mediating effect of intellectual capital. This paper fulfills an identified need to study how intellectual capital can be enabled in the open innovation of the service industries. Both Hierarchical Multiple Regression and the Structural Equation Model were employed to test the innovation model by the panel data of the second Taiwan Innovation Survey including 948 service firms. Empirical insights enable us to have a better understanding in terms of how service companies learn from external knowledge sources. This paper suggests that the impact of openness strategies on innovation performance becomes indirect through the partial mediator of intellectual capital so that innovation performance in service industry benefits from simultaneously incorporating intellectual capital with the efficient openness strategies. Finally, the paper includes implications for more insights into how service companies improve their innovative activities with external searching strategies and practices in terms of intellectual capital.;18;Computer;Ref053;Q2;2020
"Research Question: Open innovation and the open business model exaggerate complexity (a transaction cost) in addition to the realization of emergence and its lock-in. Within a short period, Alibaba has become one of the global top e-commerce companies with several open innovation business models. Our research question was: ""How could Alibaba become a global top e-commerce company in China in such a short time?"" Research Method: We chose a deep interview method, participatory observation, and meta-analysis to answer this research question. Research Result: Alibaba has applied global, creative e-commerce business models through open innovation in a short time. In addition, it has overcome complexity-i.e., the cost of open innovation and the force that breaks down a company-through an open innovation-friendly culture. This is a ""Jack-Ma style consumer confidence and new Guanxi culture"", a new and strong Chinese corporate culture. Alibaba has also undergone the expansion of its open business model feedback loop platform. This study investigated the expanded open business model feedback loop platform, the continuously strengthened open-innovation-friendly culture, and complexity, with the latter being the cost of open innovation, which was controlled by an open-innovation-friendly culture and open business model feedback loop.";18;Computer;Ref054;Q2;2020
This paper addresses the 'network' and 'open innovation' paradigms by seeking to examine the factors associated with structural positioning within university-industry networks. Drawing upon a network analysis of knowledge-based ties held by universities across the regions of the UK, it is found that those universities with the most central positions (network centrality) within university-industry network structures also have high rates of relational involvement in activities such as spin-off generation and engagement in externally funded research projects. Some forms of activity, in particular intellectual property protection through patenting, are found to be negatively associated with centrality. Spatial location is largely found to be unrelated to the network centrality of universities. By utilising network centrality as one measure of the open innovation capability of universities, the paper indicates that a range of institutional characteristics and factors tend to either promote or limit the engagement of universities in open innovation practices.;8;Engineering;Ref055;Q1;2020
The paper focuses on virtual brand community (VBC) as new management tool for open innovation. Existing research on the intersection between brand communities and innovation management shows how the knowledge of the brand communities' members and their engagement in product-related discussions represent a relevant source of innovation for the companies. However, how do companies implement open innovation through the VBC and how do they implement purposeful practices represent an unexplored research area. By adopting a value-oriented perspective of open innovation, this study interprets the VBC as a co-creation space where undertaking opportunity identification and resource mobilization for value creation and value capture. The paper presents a single case study of a multinational company operating in the semiconductor industry that has recently implemented a VBC as a tool for peer-to-peer support and knowledge sharing. Results show the features of this VBC and the set of practices designed to realize the open innovation strategies. By adopting an open innovation perspective, the article presents a model of VBC as a collaborative space for innovation. For practitioners, the article provides evidences and insights about the use of VBC to support the implementation of open innovation strategies.;3;Business;Ref056;Q1;2020
Previous studies on open innovation have primarily adopted the perspective of single firms. Against this background we explore how open innovation is managed at the network level for the case of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). Using a longitudinal case study, we report on how the ITRS deals with a technological discontinuity affecting the whole industry, namely the pursuit of an existing technological paradigm using a well-established collaborative practice set against a novel and unknown future technological paradigm to be opened up in parallel, even though the necessary knowledge about the ensuing disruption is lacking. This challenge is characterized not only by extreme technological uncertainty, but also by partner-related and procedural uncertainty concerning the key activity of ITRS, namely the setting of future technological milestones (roadmapping). We discuss attempts by the ITRS network to overcome these uncertainties and manage technological discontinuities by extending the well-established practice of roadmapping to an unknown technological paradigm. We introduce the concept of 'stretching practice' to highlight this phenomenon, and we contribute to the debate on the open innovation and technological discontinuities that arise when venturing beyond firm-centric approaches.;3;Business;Ref057;Q1;2020
"Building on the open innovation and cluster literature, our research describes how innovation policies contribute to the development of open innovation dynamics in biotech clusters. Particularly, we address the role and impact of cluster agency by adopting a contextualized perspective. We carry out comparative case studies of the main five Spanish biotech clusters by combining longitudinal data extracted from secondary sources with primary data obtained from relevant stakeholders. Our study shows that clusters policies do not yield uniform effects; the impact in terms of patterns of collaboration and (open) innovation dynamics is path dependent. The characteristics of the local texture significantly contribute to the observed open innovation ecosystems. As such, these findings imply a plea for contextualizing regional policy initiatives.";3;Business;Ref058;Q1;2020
This paper is an attempt of using co-citation analysis to sort out and to analyze the development and evolution of a latest hot area, open innovation from the perspective of network embedding. A dataset of 1437 records published between 1990 and 2019 is collected from Web of Science database. The empirical results show the latest hot topics in the open innovation study focus on innovation performance and value creation. In addition, we make a new interpretation of open innovation from four aspects: innovation and entrepreneurship, resource acquisition, knowledge sharing and innovation performance, then combines the importance of network embedding to the innovation and development of enterprises, and proposes the future research direction of open innovation. Our research in this paper is helpful to systematically sort out the knowledge context of open innovation, which is of great significance to the construction and development of open innovation knowledge system. The conclusions and implications in this paper will be particularly illuminating for both academic research and enterprises' practice application.;5;Computer;Ref059;Q1;2020
University-industry interactions have been extensively discussed by economic geographers. However, while universities increasingly engage in local and nonlocal interactions with the industry, there is a lack of evidence concerning the consequences of universities becoming involved in these open innovation processes. Therefore, this study empirically examines the effects of local and nonlocal knowledge interactions on the innovative performance of universities by utilizing a large panel database constructed from a sample of 185 universities in China. First, we observe that both local and nonlocal interactions have an inverted U-shaped relationship with university innovative performance. Second, local interactions combined with nonlocal interactions have a negative effect on the innovative performance of universities. Finally, we find that a balance is required between local and nonlocal interactions to enhance university performance. These results have important implications for policy design.;6;Development;Ref060;Q3;2020
"Purpose This paper describes the case of how the Danish beer manufacturer, Carlsberg, developed the Green Fiber Bottle as part of its sustainability program through an open innovation approach in collaboration with complementary partners. It thereby illustrates how a grand challenge associated with sustainability can be effectively addressed through open innovation and reveals the opportunities and challenges that emerge in that context. Design/methodology/approach The paper summarizes some key elements of the case and, in particular, discusses some of the lessons learned, which can be further explored in future research, practice, and policy. Findings The case suggests a number of key issues that are relevant when attempting to address grand challenges, in general, and sustainability in the food and beverage (F&B) industry, in particular, namely: leveraging open innovation in the face of sustainability as a grand challenge; sustainability beyond a solid business case; opportunities and challenges in the face of new business models; the importance of early wins for addressing societal challenges for signals and scaling; and the importance of the Nordic context and long-term vision. Originality/value The case describes a recent (and to some extent still ongoing) initiative of how a particular F&B company has explored new approaches to developing its sustainability program. Therefore, it highlights some of the unique characteristics of this case. This paper also lays the groundwork for the establishment of ""Sustainable Open Innovation"" as a domain in its own right.";1;Agriculture;Ref061;Q1;2020
Crowdsourcing provides companies with access to widespread knowledge pools and constitutes a well-established inbound open innovation practice. More recently, some companies have introduced the approach of open innovation within their company boundaries. Using internal crowdsourcing (IC), companies can apply open innovation principles to overcome information silos. Multinational corporations often have thousands of employees around the globe, embedded in divisions and virtually separated from each other. Although a large proportion of companies nowadays use social IT to mitigate problems of distance, only a few companies can access their employees' wisdom effectively-let alone efficiently. With almost 100,000 employees worldwide, SAP possesses significant resources, which IC can help to unlock and develop. In this business case study, we report the findings of our investigation of five IC implementations at SAP. Based on interviews and secondary data, we analyze the process and related governance tasks of the different IC approaches. The applications for IC range from the search for new and sustainable business models to an approach that uses crowdsourcing for the competence development of SAP's employees. Our paper contributes to our understanding of open innovation and crowdsourcing by conceptualizing IC as a form of internal open innovation. Further, from our observations, we derive six lessons learned to support managers in implementing and executing IC initiatives successfully. Our findings will subsequently help managers to increase the innovation capabilities of their companies, create more sustainable business models, further the entrepreneurial mindset of their employees and thus provide a competitive advantage.;18;Computer;Ref062;Q2;2020
Intellectual capital (IC) is among the most long-lived topics in managerial literature. More recently, the emergence of the open innovation (OI) paradigm has encouraged the understanding that firms should collaborate with other organizations to leverage their own R&D capabilities. We propose that these two streams of managerial literature should join forces since the GI paradigm could be considered an approach to innovation with foundations in relational capital, facilitated by an appropriate level of human and structural capital. Surprisingly, only a few researchers have put IC and GI into relation. Therefore, this paper has two main goals: providing a theoretical model that synoptically presents how IC and GI overlap and testing the theoretical model by analyzing how firms' IC affects OI-related performance. We analyze a sample of 3744 Spanish firms. We find that the three IC constructs positively affect GI performance, with relational and human capital subject to diminishing returns.;3;Business;Ref063;Q1;2020
Striving for competitive advantage pushes firms to innovate at a high speed along innovation contingencies and resource limitations they face. Yet, little is known about how management of contingencies such as absorptive capacity or technology radicalness can impact the innovation speed of firms. In this explorative study, we provide new empirical evidence to the innovation speed literature. We examine to what extent innovation speed is affected by organisational, technological, and relational contingencies that preoccupy firms with open innovation practices. Taking the firm perspective, we track innovation timeline and emphasise the complex trade-offs that firms encounter while innovating. Our results show that many of the contingencies, emphasised by the literature promoting innovation, could slow down its speed. Thus, strengthening competitiveness by accommodating contingencies can hinder time-critical adaptations. Furthermore, we find that innovation assets and capabilities can become liabilities for technologically innovative firms.;3;Business;Ref064;Q1;2020
This study aims to examine the relationship between open innovation (OI), organisational ambidexterity (OA), and entrepreneurial orientation (EO). Since OA is central to the short and long-term survival of the firm, there is an enormous interest in investigating organisational mechanisms for achieving higher levels of OA. Prior studies have mostly concentrated on 'internal' mechanisms, and less attention has been given to how open innovation practices can promote OA. Our observation of 214 Iran knowledge-intensive firms indicates that OI, entailing inbound and outbound open innovation activities, significantly enhances OA. Yet, contrary to our expectation, EO negatively moderates the relationship between OI and OA in the developing context of Iran. This provides compelling insights into how an open innovation approach can compensate the necessity of risky and proactive entrepreneurial activities in the less developed institutional contexts where institutional voids enhance the costs and risks of entrepreneurial initiatives. The discussion finally suggests the theoretical and managerial implications of the study and future directions.;3;Business;Ref065;Q1;2021
"Purpose Nurses are well-positioned to play an active role in the development of innovation in health care. However, their contribution to health innovation is poorly recognized and often invisible. The aim of this study was to determine the profile of innovative ideas recorded by nurses in the Innobics ideas bank, a corporate virtual community of open innovation. Design and Methods We used a cross-sectional study design. We identified all the innovative ideas recorded in Innobics from June 8, 2016, to July 6, 2018. To be eligible, the ideas had to be recorded by nurses. Each innovative idea recorded was assessed by the Certification Evaluation Committee of Innobics. After collective discussion during the evaluation sessions, each committee member independently scored the idea. The screening decision was based on the overall average score. The following variables were collected from each innovative idea that was recorded: (a) level of health care where the idea originated (primary care or secondary care), (b) subject or category according to the classification of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Health Care Innovations Exchange, (c) ratings relative to each screening criteria, and (d) the result of the screening decision: stored = ideas that were poorly developed and in which it was not possible to identify their potential for innovation; susceptible of improvement = potential ideas that needed to be improved and whose authors received comments from the evaluation committee; validated = ideas that continued the process to become innovation projects; forwarded = ideas that were not innovative but they were a complaint or a proposal for quality improvement (these were forwarded to the institutional department concerned). Findings A total of 246 innovative ideas were recorded in the period of the study, 61 (24.8%) of which were recorded by nurses. The subjects and categories of these ideas were diverse, highlighting aspects such as patient-centered care, quality improvement strategies, preventive and chronic care, and primary care. Thirty-five (57.4%) of these innovative ideas were stored, 13 (21.3%) were susceptible to improvement, 11 (18.0%) were forwarded, and 2 (3.3%) were validated. Conclusions The results demonstrated that approximately a quarter of the ideas were recorded by nurses. Subjects and categories of these ideas were diverse, some of them closely related to the profession and nursing practice. Two ideas were identified as potential innovation projects. Innobics can act as an organizational tool that promotes a climate for innovation in health care. Clinical Relevance This study recognizes nurses' contribution to a healthcare innovation initiative and their interest in sharing innovative ideas. Its findings provide useful insights into a virtual community of open innovation such as an organizational tool for encouraging creativity and innovation in healthcare. Likewise, there is also a need for further development of nurses to master healthcare innovation as a basic competence.";15;Nursing;Ref066;Q1;2020
Open innovation (OI) projects are increasingly adopted by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Yet, undertaking OI is not only a source of opportunities for SMEs as it can, at the same time, present risks. How SMEs manage the balance between the potential benefits and the emerging challenges of OI is still an overlooked topic in the literature. Using evidence gathered through multiple case studies and drawing upon the relational view of the firm, we explore how and why value creation opportunities and different managerial challenges emerge for SMEs pursuing OI projects. We analyze different stages of OI projects in several different contexts of their implementation. Our analysis sheds light on the different nature and dynamics of knowledge involved within OI projects as important boundary conditions affecting successful search paths, learning processes, and the development of appropriability mechanisms. By offering a contextualized view of OI in SMEs, this study also provides insights to business managers on the situational opportunities and constraints of OI, including managerial suggestions on actions to manage tensions within differing OI projects.;3;Business;Ref067;Q1;2020
Open innovation crowdsourcing enables online crowds to quickly generate a plethora of creative ideas. A key challenge is the convergence of ideas for further consideration from massive numbers of candidate ideas with diverse quality. Based on Cognitive Load Theory, we executed a laboratory experiment to test the associations between three types of cognitive load manipulations and idea convergence outcomes. Our findings show that germane cognitive load positively correlates with idea convergence quality, satisfaction with process, and satisfaction with outcome. Intrinsic cognitive load is negatively associated with satisfaction with process and satisfaction with outcome, while extraneous cognitive load negatively correlates only with satisfaction with outcome. We further identified the positive moderation role of knowledge self-efficacy, perceived goal clarity, and need for cognition on the relationships between germane cognitive load and idea convergence quality. Our findings can inform open innovation organizers when designing tasks and interventions to improve convergence outcomes.;5;Computer;Ref068;Q1;2020
In today's business environment, it is often argued, that if organizations want to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage, they must be able to innovate, so that they can meet complex market demands as they deliver products, solutions, or services. However, organizations alone do not always have the necessary resources (brilliant minds, technologies, know-how, and so on) to match those market demands. To overcome this constraint, organizations usually engage in collaborative network models-such as the open innovation model-with other business partners, public institutions, universities, and development centers. Nonetheless, it is frequently argued that the lack of models that support such collaborative models is still perceived as a major constraint for organizations to more frequently engage in it. In this work, a heuristic model is proposed, to provide support in managing open innovation projects, by, first, identifying project collaborative critical success factors (CSFs) analyzing four interactive collaborative dimensions (4-ICD) that usually occur in such projects-(1) key project organization communication and insight degree, (2) organizational control degree, (3) project information dependency degree, (3) and (4) feedback readiness degree-and, second, using those identified CSFs to estimate the outcome likelihood (success, or failure) of ongoing open innovation projects.;18;Computer;Ref069;Q2;2020
The concept of open innovation is currently one of the key issues regarding the innovative development of micro, small, and medium enterprises (SMEs). It has been the subject of research both in the theoretical and empirical context. At present, there is no unambiguous definition conceptualizing the conceptual scope of open innovation (OI). However, enterprises do not always decide by themselves to be open to the environment. Therefore, determinants are important, as they encourage enterprises to greater openness, which can be treated as a key element of a value chain for SMEs, contributing to their innovative development. Classification of these determinants (also named as factors) is very poor in the literature. Generally, internal and external determinants are identified. Authors decide on the selection of these factors and their division by themselves. The research presented in this article has indicated the existence of several significant regularities. Firstly, larger entities are more likely to use the OI concept. Secondly, market determinants are the most important for the use of OI among SMEs. Thirdly, both internal and external determinants have a huge impact on the application of the OI concept, with external determinants being more significant for smaller rather than larger entities. The conclusions drawn were a consequence of the assumed aim of the article: The assessment of the influence of determinants that affect the use of the OI concept among SMEs in Poland.;18;Computer;Ref070;Q2;2020
Our study focuses on how public policy can effectively increase collaboration for innovation among firms, entrepreneurs, research institutions and the public sector in a way that is easily accessible and beneficial for SMEs. In recommending Local Open Innovation (LOI), this paper helps to shape regional innovation policies by strengthening regional networks to efficiently facilitate collaborative innovation. Considering cognitive barriers and constrained resources and capabilities for applying open innovation (OI) in SMEs with unrestricted scope, a local approach offers advantages to facilitating OI. In light of our findings, we present the impact of such a policy mechanism on the adoption of CH, the unique combination of features of the LOI process, and how they affect collaboration. We also present the respective stakeholder relations, barriers preventing SMEs from engaging in CH and potential remedies LOI offers to overcome these barriers. We conclude with varieties of LOI for strengthening regional development in different contexts.;3;Business;Ref071;Q1;2020
Societies face difficult challenges which require responses that go beyond the innovation capability of most public sector organisations. Open approaches to public sector innovation that exploits digital technologies have been proposed for some years to close this gap, but our knowledge of the use and outcome of using open innovation in this context is limited. This research takes stock of the study and use of these approaches by investigating the purposes for which public sector organisations use open innovation, and how it creates value. The research question is answered through a systematic literature review and an analysis of publicly available data about the open innovation projects referred to in that literature. The research identifies five different purposes of using open innovation. It also suggests that public sector organisations primarily use open innovation to pursue one specific purpose: innovation in society. When using open innovation for this purpose, public sector organisations attempt to create value by improving citizens' quality of life and the quality of neighbourhoods. They do this primarily by co-specialising IT and other resources in society (e.g. the transportation system) and by using the outcome of this co-specialisation process to change citizen behaviour, capabilities and experiences (e.g. encouraging citizens to use the transportation system more efficiently or making citizens feel more safe when using the transportation system). This research indicates that open innovation is generally not used to open up public sector organisations or to give citizens more influence in public sector or democratic processes. The research also indicates that open innovation, until now, has primarily been used to solve minor problems, and not large scale wicked problems in society. The research suggests a framework for value creation from open innovation initiatives that pursues innovation in society. This framework might help public sector organisations increase value creation and solve wicked problems using open innovation, and might help researchers to focus future open innovation research on essential knowledge gaps.;13;Information;Ref072;Q1;2020
In collaborative crowdsourcing communities for open innovation, users generate and submit ideas as idea co-creators. Firms then select and implement valuable ideas for new product development. Despite the popularity and success of these open innovation communities, relatively little is known about the factors that determine the implementation of the user-generated ideas. Based on research on individual creativity, we propose a conceptual model integrating users' previous experience, idea presentation characteristics and feedback valence to explain the likelihood of idea implementation. We validate our research model with a panel data analysis of 43 550 ideas submitted by 16 360 users in the MIUI new product development community hosted by Xiaomi, a large electronics manufacturing company in China. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between users' past successful experience and idea implementation. Furthermore, the length of ideas is positively associated with the likelihood of idea implementation. There is also an inverted U-shaped relationship between supporting evidence and idea implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the negative effect of positive feedback and the positive effect of negative feedback on idea implementation. These findings offer rich insights to understand the phenomenon of open innovation better. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.;13;Information;Ref073;Q1;2020
Purpose Information technology plays a critical role in the open innovation process. The purpose of this study is to explore the inner mechanism of external information technology (IT) capability that affects open innovation performance. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, responses to 232 questionnaires from different firms were collected in China. Then, the proposed hypotheses were tested using regression analysis by statistical product and service solutions (SPSS). Findings The results indicate that external knowledge integration plays a mediating role in the relationship between external IT capability and open innovation performance, openness breadth positively moderates the influence of external IT capability on external knowledge integration and openness depth negatively moderates the relationship between external IT capability and external knowledge integration. Practical implications - The results, which are based on Chinese responses, provide useful suggestions for firms in China. To use external IT capability to improve open innovation performance, firms should not only stress the role of external knowledge integration but also consider their search strategy. Originality/value Both researchers and practitioners are interested in the relationship between information technology and open innovation. However, the way in which the inner mechanism of external IT capability affects open innovation performance has not been thoroughly researched. Based on knowledge integration theory, the authors construct a model that includes external IT capability, external knowledge integration, search strategy and open innovation performance. The results of this paper confirm the mediating and moderating roles of external knowledge integration and search strategy, respectively.;3;Business;Ref074;Q1;2020
Small and medium enterprise (SME) open innovation has received attention only for new product development, overlooking the fact that process innovation is a strategy commonly pursued by SMEs which requires organizing search strategies or external knowledge sourcing for that purpose. Focusing on 3,348 process-oriented innovative SMEs, defined as those that usually and primarily only introduce process rather than product innovation, this study empirically identifies key external sources of SME innovation for process technologies, linking open innovation to SME performance, and highlighting a very important distinction to literature focused on product development. The results contribute to the literature on SME open innovation.;3;Business;Ref075;Q1;2020
Based on organizational ambidexterity theory and knowledge-based view, this study presents a conceptual framework that links organizational ambidexterity, open innovation and innovation performance together and tested this framework by distributing questionnaires to senior managers in East and Mid-China to assess related variables. The empirical study analysis based on 274 returned questionnaires finds a non-linear relationship between organizational ambidexterity and innovation performance and the moderating effects of inbound and outbound open innovation on the ambidexterity-performance relationship. To effectively use organizational ambidexterity, firms need open innovation to use external ideas as well as internal ideas, and to take advantage of both internal and external paths to market.;3;Business;Ref076;Q3;2020
This study, by conducting a laboratory experiment, investigates whether social inducement can be an external instrument to promote open innovation. The study's findings suggest that social inducement, on average, leads subjects to invest more in open innovation projects. In particular, in an asymmetric inducement setting, both induced and non-induced subjects invest more and are more active in open innovation compared to a full inducement setting. Furthermore, economic uncertainty increases the effectiveness of social inducement, suggesting that open innovation is easier to promote in the presence of economic uncertainty. Our findings may suggest practitioners and policymakers applying public channels to communicate open innovation concepts with the public, which in turn helps the adoption of open innovation.;18;Computer;Ref077;Q2;2020
This paper discusses dynamics and differences of business models in the car-sharing industry and focuses on open innovation as the trigger of diverse business models among Uber in the U.S., DiDi Chuxing in China, and KakaoT in Korea. We seek to answer the following two questions: What creates the differences in the business models of the car-sharing industry? Do the differences in open innovation motivate the diversity of business models among Uber, DiDi Chuxing, and KakaoT? We incorporated participatory observation, interviews, and semi-structured questionnaire methods in our study. We used two-step participatory observation and interview methods, hence carrying out observation and interviews two times by different researchers with Uber drivers in the U.S., DiDi-Chuxing drivers in Beijing, and KakaoT taxi drivers in Korea to confirm the interview and participatory observation results. First, business models of the car-sharing firms Uber, DiDi-Chuxing, and KakaoT are not fixed but rather are dynamically changing. Second, business models of car-sharing firms are the result of interaction with government regulations, the taxi industry, public transportation, and the automotive car industry. Third, open innovation strategies of car-sharing firms determine the contents and dynamics of car-sharing business models, such as the revenue business model, responsibility business model, and system business model upon interaction with four agencies.;18;Computer;Ref078;Q2;2020
This exploratory study proposes an original methodology to operationalize and signal SMEs' engagement in challenging dimensions of implementing Open Innovation. We verify whether the European SME Instrument is achieving its goal of providing public funds to the best SMEs in Europe, the 'EU Innovation Champions'. We test our methodology on a sample of SMEs operating in the digital sector. We found that the SMEs awarded the grants are less engaged in the challenging dimensions of Open Innovation than companies that did not receive any funding. This is contrary to the intended goals of the grants. We provide policy and methodological implications relevant for the design of better OI-informed policy and the more effective evaluation of companies participating in the SME Instrument.;3;Business;Ref079;Q1;2020
In this study, we use the open innovation paradigm to analyze the development of an entrepreneurial support ecosystem. We argue that business accelerators play a critical role within an emerging entrepreneurial ecosystem. Our analysis draws on qualitative data from a business accelerator in such a context. We suggest that, in environments that have underdeveloped entrepreneurial support ecosystems, public policy should endorse the open innovation activities of key actors in entrepreneurial ecosystems. By harnessing open innovation, an accelerator forges a broader network of relationships with actors outside of the system, which in turn increases the capacity within the system and embeds it within a global innovation system.;3;Business;Ref080;Q1;2020
In the current dynamic and virtuous flow of knowledge economy, firms are concern about whether to manage innovation centrally or through decentralized business units. Two needs emerge 1. Guaranteeing organizational efficiency and 2. Exploiting effectively market opportunity. This usually implies the integration of knowledge in technology transfer which can be accrued via the knowledge sharing between parties. However, by looking into the technological and social change literature, previous studies were mainly focused on macro-foundation of technology transfer and organizational innovative capabilities with less consideration to the role of psychological precursors of collaborations. Due to this gap, we intended to build a consistent conceptual basis for collaborations and technology transfer practices at the micro level. Therefore, drawing on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) we propose a micro-foundation model for collaborative innovation and technology transfer. To test our theoretical arguments, we use data collected from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) dataset. Hypotheses are tested through both Anova and linear regression analyses. Findings show positive and linear relationships either between our perceived control factors and the intention between technology transfer and intentions.;3;Business;Ref081;Q1;2020
The primary aim around developing and optimizing an electronic health record is to improve patient care and population health. The objective of this study is to design and evaluate an action research approach for the optimization of the design of a summary page artefact within an electronic health record for newborn healthcare. An action research approach was chosen for its participatory democratic process for developing practical knowledge and solutions. Collaborative workshops lead by an independent graphic facilitator with a 'bottom up' approach, involving self-selected motivated members from multidisciplinary healthcare teams, were designed and conducted. To evaluate this approach, insights were drawn from behavioural and design science paradigms to demonstrate that knowledge and understanding of the design problem and its solution were acquired in building the optimized summary page artefact. Information system development for healthcare requires consideration not just of what we do but how and why we do things. Our analysis demonstrates that action design research represents an agile and lean approach for successful optimization and implementation of information system development in healthcare.;12;Health;Ref082;Q2;2020
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the different types of work and to examine how they are related with open innovation, either by carrying out relationships with companies or external agents, or through the outsourcing of qualified and creative work. Design/methodology/approach After the theoretical analysis of the different types of work, the empirical study uses qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to analyze the different variables and their relations which favor open innovation. Findings The combination of the variables in the QCA makes it possible to obtain three paths among the characteristics of the qualified work and open innovation, with a positive empirical result. The general conclusion is that the motivation level of the qualified work is relevant for open innovation. Originality/value The originality and value of this paper consist in relating the internal efficiency in the work management with the effectiveness and success of open innovation.;3;Business;Ref083;Q2;2020
This paper investigates the role of open innovation in the success of restaurants. Our research questions are as follows. 'Is open innovation a rational strategy for a small restaurant to attract and maintain customers? Which open innovation strategies should a small restaurant use?' We constructed our research model of open innovation ecosystem of restaurants with ingredients open innovation, recipe open innovation and service open innovation to analyse open innovation in small restaurants, which is a worldwide phenomenon. We chose four successful restaurants from Naples, one restaurant from South Korea, and a North Korean restaurant as our case studies using participant observation, in-depth interviews and semi-structured questionnaires, with the results indicating the following. First, open innovation is essential for the success of small restaurants. Second, if any small restaurant adopts a closed innovation strategy with respect to any of food ingredients, recipes or service, it should choose an open innovation strategy or open innovation platform with regard to the others to maintain its competitive advantage compared to other restaurants in the neighbourhood. Third, an open innovation platform of any of food ingredients, recipes or service, can generate additional revenue by selling independent ingredients or services.;9;Environmental;Ref084;Q1;2020
In an increasingly competitive economic environment, innovation has become an invaluable asset to the organization and for effective knowledge management (KM). Nowadays, organizations are knowledge based and their success and survival depend on creativity, diversity, and innovation. A knowledge map is a vital tool for better KM and innovation. To this effect, the innovation processes on KMin education system through knowledge transfer activities will facilitate the shift from teaching as knowledge transmission to teaching as learning facilitation. In this context, we present a new approach based on, the one hand, the critical knowledge mapping being based on an extraction work of the expert knowledge and on the other hand, the description of the conceptual framework design which allows one to exploit and integrate knowledge capitalized and external knowledge by the open innovation process. In addition, this practice makes it possible to examine how KM, in particular, the knowledge mapping, can be used to establish the flow of the internal and external information in order to increase the efficiency of creativity and invention.;5;Computer;Ref085;Q2;2020
With perspective view of open innovation, this study examines how international networks form and evolve and the empirical relationships among antecedents of international network embeddedness, international performance, and sustainable competitiveness. Data from 356 small and medium-sized exporters (SMEs) in manufacturing or technology industries in South Korea are analyzed by structural equation modeling. It assumes that international network embeddedness plays a mediating role in the relationship between internationalization and related variables. This analysis indicates that information management and proximity significantly affect international performance, while cultural differences do not, and that international network embeddedness mediates relationships between information management and international performance, and proximity and international performance. The results imply that greater international network embeddedness increases SMEs' international performance-information management and proximity play a pivotal role in embedding international networks and improving international performance. SMEs must establish and intensify international networks to improve international performance and seek to overcome limitations by developing international networks with the goal of entering international markets. Nevertheless, there is relatively little research on international network formation and embeddedness, especially for SMEs. This study determines network formation principles, determinants of international networks, and roles of international network embeddedness in relationships between the determinants and international performance. Notably, this study verifies a comprehensive model of international networks.;18;Computer;Ref086;Q2;2020
This study examines how social trust facilitates firms' collaborative efficiency in an informal economy. We extend the open innovation theory to explain the straightforward role of social trust in the Shenzhen mobile phone industry. This single case study yields two principal findings. First, social trust fosters the efficient integration of value chains for mobile phone development. Four types of informal entrepreneurs with high social trust built on homogenous sanctioned ethnic groups (i.e., Fujian, Hunan, Chaoshan, and Wenzhou) collaboratively conform to the chip vendors, independent design houses, integrators, manufacturers and channel retailers in the Shenzhen mobile phone industry. These four groups of informal entrepreneurs achieve ethnic legitimacy by organizing the value chains with mobile feature phones built on Shenzhen mobile phone modes. Second, social trust among the four sanctioned ethnic groups is a critical determinant for shortening the time-to-market of new products and catalyzes product specialization to effectively respond to market needs in the Shenzhen mobile phone industry. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for research on social trust and open innovation in informal institutions.;18;Computer;Ref087;Q2;2020
"This paper is building a detailed understanding of the organisational structures and practices in SMEs' knowledge absorption from a network of innovation partners. In particular, it explores the relationship between the openness of innovation process through innovation networks and the development of organisational structures within firms, as well as its linkage to a regional sectoral environment. It proposes a new conceptual tool of ""innovation moments"", to synthesise the key theoretical premises of knowledge management, organisational learning and absorptive capacity literatures. In order to study this vital nexus of phenomena, we propose to deploy a novel mixed methods approach of combining quantitative ego-centric Social Network Analysis (EgoSNA) and qualitative derived narratives of product development experiences via a sensitising concept, to study the emergence and development of the New Space Sector in Scotland. The findings show that the type of the SME - ""traditional"" versus New Space and upstream versus downstream is clearly related to the structure of the firms' ego-centric innovation networks and their position in the composite whole network. Furthermore, by using qualitative case study data we show that the firms' typology is also closely related to internal organisational features, in particular flattening hierarchical structures and the formalisation and standardisation within NPD processes. This paper argues that the interlinking of these two elements is poised to describe a cultural shift in the approach to innovation networking and new product development (NPD) process management, understanding of which is a critical element of examining Open Innovation in SMEs.";8;Engineering;Ref088;Q1;2020
This study examines how the implementation of industrial policy through public research and development funding impacts the outcome of open innovation collaboration between public research institutes and firms. Based on empirical study of 153 public-private technology transfer projects in the context of Singapore economy and its biotechnology sector, we found that project funding significantly and positively influences their innovation collaboration outcome. We established that public research institutes' top management team' capability in portfolio management partially mediates the conversion of project funding into innovation collaboration outcome.;3;Business;Ref089;Q1;2020
This study addresses the issue of international technology collaboration by proposing a framework for establishing national-level strategies. A multi-level strategic framework that helps a country to develop a collaboration strategy with another country at three different levels is proposed. The nature of the collaboration is investigated with respect to attractiveness at the macro-level (market and technology attractiveness), closeness at the meso-level (degree of existing relationships between the two countries), and strategy at the micro-level (collaboration targets and modes).;3;Business;Ref090;Q1;2020
Most of innovation studies and researches are not related to innovation measurement and, in general, it only addresses some innovative actions in terms of products, services or processes. This paper addresses the difficulties in researching innovation and Open Innovation (OI) performance metrics through an exploratory literature research followed by a survey conducted with small technology-based enterprises incubated at important Brazilian industrial and technological centers. It is well known that for many small business entrepreneurs and managers, the idea of CH practices are still restricted to large corporations. Against this idea, this work proposes an understanding of these OI practices, besides an analysis of its measurement. The indicators proposed by this work has been proved to be the most significant to measure OI at this kind of company and, with them, it has been possible to understand that small companies can successfully use OI and, although it is not common today, it should be encouraged. This study's conclusions can be useful for researchers and also Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) interested in joining or increasing their OI practices.;3;Business;Ref091;Q1;2020
In this study, we evaluate how science parks (SPs) promote open innovation (OI) and the role played by public policies (PPs) in this process. To perform this analysis, we introduce an initial framework based on three dimensions: the launching of SPs, the role of SPs in promoting OI, and the role of SPs as PP vectors for promoting DI. Following a qualitative study based on visits, archival analysis and interviews with SP professionals located in Brazil and Portugal, we may report that SPs promote OI by spontaneous mechanisms, deliberate actions, and as PP vectors. Furthermore, PPs promote OI in SPs both directly and indirectly. In our comparative analysis, we take into consideration the differences between the two countries. We also introduce a framework that integrates PPs, DI and SPs. As a practical implication, our framework serves to enact better PPs for SPs and thereby promoting more efficient OI.;3;Business;Ref092;Q1;2020
Technologies like computer vision, advanced sensors, internet of things, 3D printing, big data, or artificial intelligence are penetrating all facets of the industrial value chains. Hence, industry is engaged in an accelerated automation race where industrial automation converts value chains into intelligent, data-driven systems. This generates new business models and spurs firm competitiveness in general. Companies thus pay attention to the development, acquisition, and incorporation of related technologies to profit from these developments in specific. For this, they must incorporate external flows of knowledge to succeed in innovation. Yet, there is a dearth of research that links open innovation to the incorporation of industrial automation, and to firm performance. Hence, this paper takes a knowledge-based view of the firm and sheds light on the moderating role of the processes of open innovation on the economic results of firms' subject to automation. In order to do so, we estimate the impact of the interaction of open innovation and automation on firm turnover using panel data for 5287 Spanish firms from a variety of manufacture and service industries. We separate the effects for different open-innovation partners and find that turnover is increased for those automating firms that engage in open innovation with suppliers. These results indicate that suppliers possess the knowledge required for successful automation, and firms that innovate together with suppliers fare better at leveraging investments in automation. In addition, automating firms should exercise caution when choosing collaboration partners from the same country.;3;Business;Ref093;Q1;2020
Based on the patent data collected from smartphone industry over the period 2000-2017, we utilize two-stage least squares to investigate the bidirectional relationship between network inertia and inbound open innovation practices. Furthermore, our research is of great benefit to better understanding of the interplay of network reach and network centrality on network inertia and inbound open innovation, and the moderating effects of network centrality on the reciprocal relationship between network inertia and inbound open innovation practice. The empirical results confirm that there is a bidirectional relationship between network inertia and inbound open innovation, and network centrality shows the moderating effect on the above relationship. Moreover, network centrality moderates the positive effects of network reach on network inertia and inbound open innovation. These findings suggest that network centrality and network reach are important factors of the firms' network inertia and inbound open innovation. The results of the models in this paper suggest that firms with higher network inertia in the innovation networks are less likely to search for sources outside their boundary. In summary, we fill the research gap in exploring the bidirectional relationship between network inertia and inbound open innovation.;5;Computer;Ref094;Q1;2020
This paper investigates how firms can orchestrate outbound open innovation strategically to accelerate technological progress among the firms they collaborate with, thus removing technological bottlenecks in their business ecosystem. We examine how a major oil and gas producer fostered, through its internal corporate venture unit, the development of new technologies aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the oilfield services offered by its key providers. The comparative analysis of five innovative projects suggests that two factors were critical for the successful deployment of the proposed technologies: their potential to broaden service providers' portfolios and the possibility to retain control over the relevant intellectual property. The concurrent presence of these two factors incentivized service providers to deploy the new technologies, aligning their interests with those of the oil major company. By revealing unexplored aspects of the interplay of inter-firm collaborations and open innovation processes, this paper extends our understanding of how firms can align the incentives and activities of other actors in their business ecosystems by strategizing their open innovation initiatives.;3;Business;Ref095;Q1;2020
Driven by a rapid development of the so-called 'open innovation' paradigm, previous studies have provided broad evidence of the positive effects of external knowledge sources on innovation. Yet, little is known about the impact of external knowledge sources on innovative activities in the renewable energy sector. Based on an analysis of original survey results involving R&D organisations, we examine the role of different knowledge sourcing strategies for innovation in two technology fields, namely solar and wind power. The link between external knowledge sourcing and innovation performance is found to depend on sourcing strategies and technology fields. Our results contribute to the evaluation of strategy design by showing that solar power innovation benefits from a broad search strategy drawing on a large number of external knowledge sources, while wind power innovation tends to thrive through intensive use of a more limited number of external sources. We derive implications for innovation and energy policy.;18;Computer;Ref096;Q1;2020
"Purpose Despite typically being regarded as ""low tech"", the food manufacturing and technology sector is increasingly turning to open innovation practices involving collaboration with universities in order to innovate. Given the broad range of activities undertaken by this sector and the fact that it utilises analytical, synthetic and symbolic knowledge for innovation, it makes an interesting case study on the factors that influence the formation of university-industry (U-I) links. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach Using data from 249 collaborative projects that occurred between UK universities and food manufacturing and technology firms, the analysis utilises a logistic regression model based on a ""synthetic counterfactual approach"" to modelling the probability a collaborative link will be established with one university and not others. Findings The results suggest that organisational proximity, conceptualised through the presence of prior ties between actors, has the largest influence on the formation of U-I links. In addition, spatial and technological proximities between actors also have a positive influence on link formation. This result suggests that the specificity of knowledge of the food sector is important in the formation of these U-I links. Originality/value The food sector is under-represented in empirical studies on university collaboration; this paper addresses this and provides new insights into the formation of these links.";3;Business;Ref097;Q2;2021
This article aims to explore drivers of success of a crowdsourcing platform. The study conceptualizes crowdsourcing as a mode of open innovation and places such a concept within the context of the sharing economy. Upon this framework, the paper analyses the case of InnoCentive, a successful crowdsourcing platform where innovation-driven organizations search for solutions to their R&D tasks. The system dynamics model frames main InnoCentive business processes and offers a causal perspective on the relationships between platform performance-in terms of users base-and resources structure. The discussion on simulation outputs is carried out through a dynamic performance management view of performance, so as to highlight which factors are crucial to lead crowdsourcing platform to be effective in supporting seekers organization to innovate in an open way, as well as to understand how platform managers may improve such a problem-solving process.;3;Business;Ref098;Q2;2021
Purpose This study aims to assess how firm functional capability moderates the relationship between two types of open innovation and performance, with a special focus on the role of technological capability and the join effect market information management capability. This paper develops and tests a research model, which assesses how the performance implications of two open innovation forms are shaped by the technological capability and how such an effect is contingent on market information management capability. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected from 238 Chinese high-tech enterprises. Structural equation modeling and linear regression were used to test the data. Then, the main research questions were answered. Findings Empirically results show that technological capability strengthens the influence of inbound open innovation on firm performance. However, the moderate effect of technological capability on the relationship between outbound open innovation and firm performance remains unsupported. A higher technological capability with a high level of market information management capability increases the efficacy of outbound open innovation in gaining superior performance. Additional analysis shows that when firms implement inbound activities and possess a strong technological capability, they will achieve higher performance if they possess a moderate level of market information management capability, compared with a high or low level. Originality/value This paper provides new evidence on the benefits of different open innovation strategies on firm's performance and, more importantly, the specific firm-level contingencies (technological capability and market information management capability) under which these benefits are more likely to be enhanced. It clarifies what the capabilities are and how they interact to foster the robust open innovation strategies, which sheds new light on the boundary conditions that affect the open innovations-firm performance relationship.;3;Business;Ref099;Q1;2020
This research focuses on how the tourism and hospitality industry is applying the paradigm of open innovation, supported by social media. Open innovation (OI) has been on the topical research agenda, but the previous literature lacks studies in the service sector and specifically for tourism companies. Moreover, the introduction of social media as a tool to implement open innovation is considered the main research gap. Structural equation modelling is applied to data from 181 Portuguese and Spanish companies to study both customer involvement in new product development and the perceptions and results in terms of turnover and competitiveness. The structure of the relationships between research and development, external openness and open innovation management is highlighted with statistical analysis. In addition, the introduction of social media adds value to the proposed model. Currently, there is a lack of available models to give structure to the OI paradigm and to allow us to manage it. The contribution of this research is a comparison of the explanatory power of three models that allow us to test how certain strategic guidelines in tourism companies influence each other and have a mediating or multiplier effect when linked to each other (nested models method). In conclusion, the originality of this research is based on the relationship between open innovation management and social media and the mediating effect of external openness.;19;Social;Ref100;Q1;2020
"The Internet of Things (IoT) has led towards a digital world in which everything becomes connected. Unfortunately, most of the currently marketed connected devices feed vertically-oriented closed systems (commonly referred to as vertical silos) which prevent the development of a unified global IoT. This issue is all the more valid in complex environments, such as smart cities, in which exceedingly large amounts of heterogeneous sensor data are collected, and in which platforms and stakeholders should also be able to interact and cooperate. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to move towards the creation of open IoT ecosystems to support efficient smart city service integration, discovery and composition. This paper contributes to the specifications of such an ecosystem, which has been developed as part of the EU's H2020 bIoTope project. The novelty of this ecosystem compared with the current literature is threefold: (i) it is based on the extensive use of open communication and data standards, notably O-MI and O-DF standards, that foster technical, syntactic and semantic interoperability over domains; (ii) it proposes an innovative service marketplace for data/service publication, discovery and incentivization; (iii) it integrates security functionalities at the IoT gateway level. The practicability of our ecosystem has been validated through several smart city proofs-of-concept set up in three distinct cities: Helsinki, Lyon and Brussels. Given the five major themes defined in the CITYKeys (a smart city performance indicator framework), namely People, Planet, Prosperity, Governance and Propagation, bIoTope mainly contributes to Prosperity-related metrics, as discussed in this paper.";5;Computer;Ref101;Q1;2020
Purpose - This paper explores how learning processes supported by intensive use of design can favour absorptive capacity in open innovation contexts characterised by the interaction of a high number of diverse stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach - The paper combines the insights from theory with the empirical evidence gathered by adopting a case study approach. Findings - Findings provide evidence about the role of design-based learning to facilitate intra- and interorganisational knowledge flows and to sustain absorptive capacity through processes of recognition, internalisation and adoption. Research limitations/implications - The study integrates currently distinct research streams focussing on (1) design research, particularly on how design can support knowledge processes and specific learning processes and (2) open innovation, particularly regarding how to enhance absorptive capacity in those contexts in which a high number of diverse stakeholders interact. Practical implications - This study can help companies, research institutions and other organisations leveraging open innovation to reflect on the potential of design-based learning processes and on how to deliberately facilitate such processes in their projects. Originality/value - The original contribution provided by this study is to explore open innovation through some analytical categories elaborated in design research concerning materially grounded forms of designbased learning. In particular, the study investigates how design supports knowledge transfer, sharing, translation and creation.;3;Business;Ref102;Q1;2020
"Open data and open innovation are two topics currently attracting the attention of academics. But no previous studies consider these fields in combination while using a bibliometric approach. Thus, the aim of this paper is to understand the relationship between open innovation and open data. Two research questions have been formulated: 1) What are the main topics studied in the literature that combine both lines of research? and 2) How can the open innovation paradigm be integrated in the open data impact process? To address the first question, a co-word analysis is used to identify the main topics investigated in the open innovation and open data literature. Based on our results, to answer the second research question, the topics are grouped and analyzed considering a model of the open data impact process. Finally, some future research lines to analyze the open data impact process for open innovation are presented. For example, future research could focus on questions such as (1) What kind of applications can be created through the reuse of open data?; and (2) How do open innovation processes influence the reuse of open data?";5;Computer;Ref103;Q1;2020
"A number of studies focus on the effects of open innovation on firm performance. However, in our view, previous contributions suffer from two main limitations: at first, there is still no homogeneity in the proposition of what ""firm performance"" is, according to extant literature. In addition, we see a heterogeneity of implications for the relationship between openness and performance, since there is still no consensus among authors on whether the relationship between openness and firm performance is positive, negative or non-linear. We address this issue through an empirical analysis of a cross-national unbalanced panel data of European firms listed in the five major European markets in the years 2008-2013. We seek to sort the impact of the level of inbound openness, derived by the amount invested in internal development versus the external acquisition of intangible assets on firm performance according to three dimensions: economic performance, measured as the amount of firm turnover; firm financial performance, measured with shares value; and human resources performance, measured as the level of employment. Results of panel data regression show that the effects of both internal development and external acquisition are positive and significant across different dimensions, but their output varies in terms in magnitude and distribution both variables are positively and significantly correlated with firm turnover, and that their effect on the latter is almost equal. In addition, we find that only internal development is positively and significantly correlated with the other two dimensions of performance, once we control for firm-specific time trends. Once we control for relative size of firms in the sample, we see that the effect of openness is more spread out across different class sizes, while the effect of internal development of intangibles influences the economic performance only for larger firms, and increases employment only for relatively smaller firms, while it has no effect on the financial side of performance.

This paper aims at investigating the role of makers in open innovation networks by focusing on whether and how knowledge leaks occur in open innovation networks with makers. In the last years, makers have been widely recognized as conducive to innovation and growth in different fields through a novel and open approach. However, little is known about the role played by makers and, more specifically, about the flow of unintended knowledge - i.e. knowledge leaks. Data have been collected by iteratively deploying a snowball sampling technique in an Italian high-tech cluster with a dense and heterogeneous ecosystem of makers. Data analysis relied on social network analysis method and techniques. Findings shed light on a totally unexplored phenomenon and suggest intriguing implications both for theory and practice on whether and how knowledge is exchanged in innovation networks and how knowledge leaks occur.

We discuss ICT for Open Innovation (OI) from a capabilities perspective. We distinguish two types of capabilities for OI: strategic, which need to be developed so that the organization can take advantage of an OI strategy proactively, and operational for the efficient implementation of OI processes. ICT at the strategic level supports dynamic capabilities and related cognitive processes of managerial staff for developing and using the appropriate level of absorptive capacity and active transparency, whereas ICT as part of operational capabilities aims at enhancing the day-to-day performance of OI activities. Through analysis of capabilities, we associate specific ICT with the functionalities required in the entire OI process. Paying particular attention to the issues of collaboration and sophisticated data analysis, we also comment on the seamless integration of these technologies and their embedment in OI-related organizational processes.

The present article analyzes the rationale, types, experience, and potentiality of applying open innovation models in organizations to conduct their research and development (R&D) activities. In order to carry out R&D activities and to demonstrate the utility and applicability of innovation models, a new methodology is developed for the creation of profiles of open innovation models. The comparison of thirty different companies analyzed and later classified in competitiveness matrices, allows a given organization to know what its margins of improvement are. Therefore, along eight dimensions of identified innovation activities, the outcomes demonstrate the high value of the use of this methodology by organizations to increase their levels of R&D and innovation.;5;Computer;Ref107;Q1;2020
"Firms in open innovation ecosystems expand organizational resources and allow for collaborations across organizations, which can promote the flow, aggregation, and integration of resources within business network ecosystems. Yet, particular gaps in the literature limit our understanding of how open innovation ecosystems contribute to firm product innovation. Therefore, this study explores the causal recipes of how open innovation ecosystem modes promote product innovation by using both grounded theory and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). First, by taking four innovative firms as case studies and applying grounded theory, we identify six specific open innovation ecosystem modes: ""firm-university-institute cooperation,"" ""interfirm cooperation,"" ""firm-intermediary cooperation,"" ""firm-user cooperation,"" ""asset divestiture,"" and ""technology transfer."" Then, based on the data of 226 innovative firms, we employ fsQCA to explore the causal configurations of the open innovation ecosystem modes that consistently improve product innovation. The findings reveal that three particular combinations can explain the high level of product innovation: (1) interfirm cooperation, firm-intermediary cooperation, and technology transfer combined with asset divestiture; (2) interfirm cooperation, firm-intermediary cooperation, and technology transfer combined with firm-university-institute cooperation; and (3) interfirm cooperation, firm-intermediary cooperation, and firm-university-institute cooperation combined with firm-user cooperation. Overall, this work contributes to the theoretical literature on open innovation ecosystems and provides practical information for firms looking to achieve value creation.";3;Business;Ref108;Q1;2020
The purpose of this paper is to propose a fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM)-based systematic approach for building and analyzing problem solving networks in open innovation and illustrate the use of this approach with an application in a company operating in prepress preparation sector. First, the proposed approach is explained step by step. Then, for illustrating the use of this approach, case study method was used and data was collected in a company using a visual form developed for this study and analysis of data was performed using social network analysis (SNA) and FCM methods. The results of the study show that by using the proposed approach managers can better understand, sustain, and develop knowledge management practices in open innovation networks in their companies by considering dynamic contextual factors on their relationships. Visual representation of the resulting network helps managers to better understand their internal and external relationships and identify the most valuable network participants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using SNA and FCM methods together in order to capture the effect of dynamic contextual factors on the relationships in innovation field.;5;Computer;Ref109;Q4;2020
In the digital age, open innovation is increasingly organized around platform ecosystems. This paper investigates how firms can coordinate open innovation as a platform strategy for the development of complementary products by independent third parties. We draw on a qualitative case study of Philips Hue - a connected lighting platform for consumers with its variety of complementary products. We identify three increasingly complex ways in which independent complements connect to a focal platform. Our findings show that managing these connections requires a hybrid open innovation approach that combines arm's length coordination, with a large number of complementors through open interfaces, and intensive bilateral collaboration, with a selected number of partners. Our findings demonstrate that complex interconnections across digital platforms and products lead to the management challenge of navigating an 'ecology of platforms', which warrants future research.;3;Business;Ref110;Q1;2020
Open Data (OD) utilisation has been encouraged by governments because of its potential to fuel digital innovation. Despite this, there is a paucity of study into the role of OD for SMEs, in contrast to the growing literature that has focused on the collection and sharing of OD by the public sector. As such, our study contributes to open innovation research by analysing the main capabilities needed to overcome existing barriers to successfully manage OD in SMEs. Building upon the recent SME-oriented OI literature and adopting an interpretative absorptive capacity framework, we analyse the data collected from 30 semi-structured interviews with experts working in UK organisations adopting OD-based OI strategies. We find a number of core factors that shape OD acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation by SMEs. Results show that without the specific OD capabilities identified in our study, it will be difficult for SMEs to successfully use OD, which may explain why the uptake of OD by SMEs more broadly has so far been limited. These unique OD capabilities need to be better developed by OD using SMEs, if this 'raw material' for the digital economy is to be fully exploited.;3;Business;Ref111;Q1;2020
"The digital age allows for integration of dispersed groups into the innovation process. These heterogeneous groups of individuals varying in size and knowledge distribution, also referred to as crowds, build the basis for open innovation contests (OIC), one of the most common forms of crowdsourcing innovation. Different from more focused forms of open innovation, at OIC innovation managers often do not identify or evaluate participants ex-ante. Instead, innovation managers often make use of open calls for participation and assume efficient self-selection of participants i.e., that only motivated and qualified participants will volunteer and engage in the innovation contest. This behavior reflects one of the key assumption of crowdsourcing in participatory innovation settings. However, not every self-selected member is in the position to solve the contest task appropriately. Hence, innovation contests often result in large numbers of submissions, covering a wide range of quality levels, causing decision biases and significant workloads for innovation managers to select ideas. This problem is referred to as ""crowding"". In order to reduce ""crowding"", open innovation researchers are interested in understanding which types of individuals make the ""best"" contributions and therefore should be preferably encouraged to participate in in OIC. In this paper, we are assessing what characterizes those participants who submit innovative ideas to OIC, in particular those who submit incremental ideas vs. those who have more radical ideas. Drawing on the componential model of creativity and data generated in innovation contest held by chocolate producer Ritter Sport, we analyze the effect of participants' creativity, domain knowledge, and several motivational factors on the innovativeness of their contributions. We find all of these factors to affect the innovativeness of an idea. However, regarding generating incremental or radical innovations, some factors have opposing roles. Our findings imply for practice that innovation managers must decide which type of innovations they intend to generate and then design contests to attract participants with the required characteristics, if they want to increase the number of appropriate ideas and reduce the problems of ""crowding"".";3;Business;Ref112;Q1;2020
Over the past decades open innovation (OI) practices have gained prominence among both scholars and practitioners as a mean to accelerate time-to-market and reduce development costs of innovations. Thereby scholars have nearly exclusively focused on cross-boundary knowledge flows between the focal firm and (its) external collaborators. This paper argues that such a focus limits our understanding of how multi-business firms with a diverse knowledge base profit from internally applied open innovation practices that in turn provide complementary benefits to OI. We build on the current literature by investigating and describing OI activities that are conducted within the boundaries of the multi-business firm. Based on a multiple case study of 23 collaboration practices conducted across 14 firms, our findings reveal 5 archetypal forms of internally applied open innovation activities. We draw on the literature of cross-divisional innovation and crowdsourcing to highlight how these archetypes differ in terms of their purpose and underlying managerial processes. Multi-business firms regularly rely on internal practices due to lower transaction costs and for stimulating a collaborative culture. We conclude that internally applied OI practices are effectively stimulated by a combination of non-monetary reward systems and purposive integration mechanisms.;3;Business;Ref113;Q1;2020
With its focus on value creation and value capture, open innovation research explicitly or implicitly examines the competitive impacts of collaboration. However, to date such research has not considered the effects of a blockbuster industry structure upon open innovation. Here, we examine a particular form of multilateral collaboration, the open R&D consortium, in which the results from collaboration are allowed to spill over to members and nonmembers alike. We do so in the context of the pharmaceutical industry, a stable but fragmented industry defined by the ongoing search for blockbuster hits protected by strong appropriability. Using a novel data set, we identify 141 such consortia that involve two or more of the 30 largest pharma firms. We show that firms financially support such consortia, in part, because their value creation activities benefit members without disrupting the value capture or other aspects of the incumbent industry structure. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on multilateral collaboration in blockbuster industries, and open innovation more generally.;3;Business;Ref114;Q1;2020
Digital transformation has undoubtedly become a key enabler of innovation as evidenced by the numerous firms that use digital technologies to manage their innovation processes. This issue is even more relevant today when innovation processes have become more open and require greater resources in the different implementation phases to capture and transfer knowledge within and outside the firm's boundaries. This implies additional challenges in managing the increasing amount of knowledge and information flows. Accordingly, digital technologies can be used and implemented to manage open innovation processes through easier access and sharing the knowledge created and transferred. Nevertheless, literature in these fields does not provide a structured view of how and why digital technologies are used to manage innovation processes in an open perspective. This paper aims to bridge this gap by adopting the theoretical lenses of change management to identify the managerial actions at organizational and process level that companies perform to implement digital technologies in their open innovation processes. Accordingly, the paper investigates how and why these managerial actions required for and enabled by digital technologies help firms to develop and nurture open innovation. From an empirical point of view, the exploratory multiple case study analyzes nine firms operating in different industries and varying in size, market share, and organizational structure.;3;Business;Ref115;Q1;2020

This paper analyzes the factors affecting open innovation performance in the Korean Contents industry, with a focus on alliance strategy and intellectual property (IP) management capacity, by applying multiple regression models with data collected from 89 companies. The results showed that the technological alliance of a content company has a statistically significant impact on its innovation performance. IP management capacity also showed a positive influence on an innovation performance of content companies. This study suggests that content companies need to build up technological alliance with multiple external sources and their IP management capacity in order to maximize their open innovation performance.;8;Engineering;Ref117;Q2;2020
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how communication practices influence individuals' team assembly and performance in open innovation contests. Design/methodology/approach This study analyzed behavioral trace data of 4,651 teams and 19,317 participants from a leading open innovation platform, Kaggle. The analyses applied weighted least squares regression and weighted mediation analysis. Findings Sharing online profiles positively relates to a person's performance and likelihood of becoming a leader in open innovation teams. Team assembly effectiveness (one's ability to team up with high-performing teammates) mediates the relationship between online profile sharing and performance. Moreover, sharing personal websites has a stronger positive effect on performance and likelihood of becoming a team leader, compared to sharing links to professional social networking sites (e.g. LinkedIn). Practical implications Open innovation organizers should encourage online profile sharing among participants to facilitate effective team assembly in order to improve innovation outcomes. Originality/value The current study highlights the importance of team assembly in open innovation, especially the role of sharing online profiles in this process. It connects two areas of research that are previously distant, one on team assembly and one on online profile sharing. It also adds new empirical evidence to the discussion about online information credibility.;3;Business;Ref118;Q1;2020
Purpose This paper aims to focus on the human side of inbound open innovation by analyzing the effects that the adoption of different knowledge search strategies for innovation has on new recruitment needs. Design/methodology/approach Building on several theoretical perspectives, the study proposes three hypotheses regarding the relationship between openness and the need to recruit people with high technical and social skills. Using a pooled panel data from the Uruguayan Innovation Survey between 2004 and 2012, the authors identify open strategies followed by the firm. Findings The estimation results using pooled panel data confirm that the adoption of inbound open search strategies for innovation demands the recruitment of new employees with higher technical and social skills. Technical skills are more likely to be demanded than social skills. The effects observed are moderated by the intensity in the use of knowledge and information sources (KISs). Originality/value This paper revisits the analysis of specific knowledge search strategies at the firm level. In doing so, the study looks for the effects of specific strategies combining different knowledge sources and considers different levels of use of external KISs, from narrow to wide. While other studies have analyzed the human factor as a determinant of the success of openness for innovation, this paper re-examines the direction of this relationship. Finally, the study contributes to the evidence from a Latin American country, where these topics have received less attention.;13;Information;Ref119;Q1;2019
"Purpose Open innovation and information systems have been key topics in the theoretical domain, but little empirical research thoroughly examines how information technology (IT) capability affects open innovation performance. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between IT capability and open innovation performance and to expose the inner mechanism at the firm level. Design/methodology/approach This paper collected firm-level data in China; 232 usable questionnaires from different firms were collected. Then, the study used a structural equation model by AMOS for hypothesis testing. Findings The results indicate that both internal IT capability and external IT capability have positive impacts on open innovation performance; potential absorptive capacity and realized absorptive capacity mediate the relationship between external IT capability and open innovation performance. Additionally, realized absorptive capacity plays a mediating role in the relationship between internal IT capability and open innovation performance. Originality/value Existing research has emphasized the influence of IT on open innovation, but empirical studies have not thoroughly focused on the inner mechanisms of the effect of IT capability on open innovation performance. Drawing on firm capability theory, this paper classifies IT capability as internal and external IT capability and absorptive capacity as potential and realized absorptive capacity. Then, this paper confirms the mediating role of absorptive capacity between IT capability and open innovation performance.";3;Business;Ref120;Q2;2021
Foreign direct investment brings both increased competitive pressures and opportunities for domestic Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs). Competition may force them to seek new international markets, but also provide access to international customers. However, as economies become more knowledge-based in order to access international markets, SMEs must seek to innovate. This study examines how foreign firm presence and innovation influence the exporting activities of SMEs. It contributes to the existing literature by dividing innovation into product/process innovation and in-house/open innovation. With open innovation, products are more likely to be novel and productivity boosted to a larger degree. We interact different types of innovation with foreign influence to examine whether there is a moderating influence on the relationship. The individual firm level data and foreign influence data are from the Longitudinal Small Business Survey and Office for National Statistics. Whether firms are active exporters is explored using multilevel logit regressions. Both innovative activities and the foreign influence increase the likelihood of exporting. In-house product innovation boosts export propensity to a lesser degree in areas with higher levels of foreign influence. The hypothesis that open innovation has more impact on exporting activities when foreign influence is greater is not supported for either type of innovation.;6;Development;Ref121;Q3;2020
"This paper addresses how the open innovation concept can be applied in large corporations aiming to work with small innovative firms. More specifically, we report an in-depth qualitative study of how AstraZeneca, a global bio-pharmaceutical corporation, designed and enacted a new mode of organizing for coupled open innovation, with an initiative called the BioVentureHub. The governance structure behind this way of organizing is explored and conceptualized, and we also analyse how this structure shaped the relations and the value being collaboratively generated and shared. Theoretically, the paper connects the governance literature with open innovation. From the analysis of the empirical case, we propose a distinct governance structure that we label as a corporate hub, and we distinguish it from other ""open"" governance forms, e.g. market, network and bazaar governance, and explain the potential value it brings for coupled open innovation between large and small firms.";3;Business;Ref122;Q1;2019
Open Innovation is a leading paradigm in the current landscape, and scholars have been highly focused on defining the characteristics and capabilities that firms need to implement it successfully. This research aims to understand how organizations may implement inbound OI projects. Relying on a multiple case study approach and based on primary and secondary sources, this research highlights two main approaches: team-centred and individual-centred. The two approaches are discussed according to previous studies, highlighting how the first one is particularly coherent with previous research on Open Innovation, while the second one offers great insights from an Agile Project Management perspective. In particular, this research suggests how the Open Innovation literature can be enriched by considering the recent advancements in the Agile literature, valuing the individual and its autonomy to embrace external ideas from an OI perspective.;3;Business;Ref123;Q1;2019
This paper aims to assess the critical success factors (CSF) to implement open innovation (OI) in companies of Regional Innovation Systems. The CSF compiled from the literature were subjected to factor analysis and grouped into five main categories. These factors were transformed into indicators to assess the CSF and verify RIS companies' stance on OI implementation. The companies were subsequently grouped by similarity to form three distinct clusters in relation to CSF. Cluster analysis revealed a group of companies committed to OI, mostly influenced by service companies, a group of conservative companies or companies with limitations regarding OI, and a third group of companies that resisted this strategy. The results yielded interesting insights about the implementation of open innovation in Regional Innovation Systems that can help to further academic discussions on this topic. Furthermore, this paper provides indicators that managers can use as tools to identify and assess which CSF for OI have the most impact in their business context, and on which CSF they must focus their efforts and improve.;3;Business;Ref124;Q2;2019
Innovation in the medical technology (med tech) industry has a major impact on well-being in society. Open innovation has the potential to accelerate the development of new or improved healthcare solutions. Building on work system theory (WST), this paper explores how a multi-sided open innovation platform can systematically be established in a German med tech industry cluster in situations where firms had no prior experience with this approach. We aim to uncover problems that may arise and identify opportunities for overcoming them. We performed an action research study in which we implemented and evaluated a multi-sided web-based open innovation platform in four real-world innovation challenges. Analyzing the four different challenges fostered a deeper understanding of the conceptual and organizational aspects of establishing the multi-sided open innovation platform as part of a larger work system. Reflecting on the findings, we developed five design principles that shall support the establishment of multi-sided open innovation platforms in other contexts. Thus, this paper contributes to both theory and practice.;3;Business;Ref125;Q1;2019
Open innovation ecosystems involve the transfer of knowledge between multiple stakeholders to contribute toward product and service innovation, and to an extent, have superseded network-level approaches to co-creation. Effective management of the knowledge and information transferred between ecosystem partners is crucial for the process of open innovation. However, to date, limited research has focused on ascertaining the conditions required for knowledge transfer success, particularly where the context involves collaboration between diverse organizational actors. Correspondingly, this study extends existing knowledge by presenting an exploration of conditions for knowledge transfer success between ecosystem partners. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with thirty key stakeholders in order to acquire their perceptions of the presence of specific conditions within their ecosystem partnerships. Empirical data were analyzed using a fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis approach, resulting in the production of success recipes from multinational, small and medium-sized enterprise, and academic institution perspectives. Results indicate that combinations of knowledge, relationship, and organizational characteristics contribute to knowledge transfer success. However, these combinations are found to be dependent on the type of ecosystem partnership involved. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are presented, along with acknowledged limitations and suggestions for further work.;13;Information;Ref126;Q1;2019
The relationship between open innovation and company's competitive advantage, and organisational capabilities required remains to be explained. This study was conducted to answer the following questions. Does open innovation create organisation's competitive advantage? What types of capabilities are needed in the process of open innovation reaching competitive advantage, and what kind of relationship do they have? This study extends the scope of theoretical discussion about open innovation from the point of dynamic capability view. The results confirmed the statistical significance of the path linking open innovation to competitive advantage through product innovation. From the viewpoint of capabilities, transforming capability plays a role of significant prerequisite of sensing capability and seizing capability, having a direct or indirect significant effect on product innovation performance and competitive advantage sequentially. The results suggest that the linkages between the needed capabilities of organisation must be considered for performing open innovation to secure competitive advantage.;18;Computer;Ref127;Q1;2019
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to advance knowledge by exploring how small and medium enterprises (SMEs) search for external knowledge in their open innovation processes, and how the search can be advanced. Design/methodology/approach This exploratory research employs a qualitative multiple case study design. A literature review of open innovation in SMEs and external knowledge search is used to build the premises of this study. Semi-structured interviews with eight SMEs are employed to collect subsequent exploratory empirical data. Findings This exploratory study revealed that SMEs adopted a combination of cognitive and experiential search heuristics where cognitive search was practiced during the innovation research process when searching for external knowledge, whilst experiential search was practiced during the innovation development process. Concerning the search space, this study found that SMEs mainly explored local knowledge, and occasionally pursued distant knowledge when confronted with complex problems. The reason for the above behavior was explained to be related to the reduction of costs and risks associated with innovation activities. Originality/value External knowledge plays a pivotal role in open innovation. Although extant studies have shed some light on how large firms search for external knowledge, however, it is not clear how SMEs search for external knowledge. Moreover, this study focuses on learning about both the search space and the search heuristics at both the research and the development stages of the innovation process.;3;Business;Ref128;Q2;2020
Purpose The hostile environments in which museums operate force them to be innovative. Most of them have fewer resources and are publicly owned. Because these factors may hinder their innovative potential, this paper aims to propose an open innovation model adapted to this type of organization to improve visitors' experience. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative method based on a thematic analysis is carried out. Data sources are: (i) focus group with stakeholders from the destination and (ii) in-depth interviews with museums experts. Findings This new framework is important because it brings something new to a field that previous research had barely considered. The study of the implementation of open innovation in publicly owned small and medium-sized museums brings to light the growing importance of the relational, organizational, technological and experiential dimensions, their interactions and their main constituent factors. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to a specific type of institution, and results should not be extrapolated to other contexts. The construct of open innovation is highly complex, and that advises future research to include other players. Quantitative methods and longitudinal techniques will contribute to tackling new challenges in future research works. Practical implications - Results are helpful for museum managers and policymakers. Stakeholders improve their comprehension of how an open innovation model works because the paper offers a few guidelines for its active designing. A solid networking based on trust and the emphasis on improving the visitor experience determine making-decision processes. Originality/value The paper provides a systemic innovation management model for museums, where there is almost no previous research. It is theoretically supported in the open innovation paradigm, as well as the absorptive capacity framework. The emerging and central role of the experiential dimension constitutes another notable contribution to literature.;19;Social;Ref129;Q1;2019
"The purpose of this paper is to understand to what extent open innovation (OI) is utilized in R&D departments by using patents as a main source. The paper adopts the ""designation of the inventor"" as a new method for detecting open or closed innovation, a method which examines the type of relationship that exists between the inventor(s) and the patent applicant(s). Since the openness or closedness of an invention is mainly measured by analyzing a firm's co-applicants, the patent's designation of the inventor indicates whether or not inventors are employees of the applicant. The paper offers new empirical evidence about whether a patent is open or not without surveying inventors and it complements previous studies that failed to describe whether a patent is based on open or closed innovation. After studying a collection of 231 patents in the wind energy sector obtained from the European Patent database, descriptive statistics show that OI Patents (OIPs) where the inventor is under agreement represent approximately 90% of the total number of OIPs, which in turn account for more than 23% of the total number of closed and open types of patent. Additionally, the designation of inventor method is also able to identify closed innovation-based patents. The results also show that a minority of companies utilize a hybrid type of OI, in which the inventors are composed of a mix of external individuals and employees. The results suggest that the method proposed yields a better understanding of how OI as well as other innovation strategies are utilized by firms in a particular industry or technological field.";8;Engineering;Ref130;Q1;2020
This study evaluates bibliometric analysis of sustainable tourism in the open innovation realm, depicts emerging themes, and offers critical discussion for theory development and further research. Through the use of bibliometrix, this paper investigates the amount of studies conducted in this area and verifies if such studies have represented a contribution to the evolving research in the field of sustainable tourism. Specifically, the paper identifies whether and to what extent scholars have explored these interconnections and maps to get to a conceptual structure of the field under investigation. The results identify the development status and the leading trends in terms of impact, main journals, papers, topics, authors, and countries. The analysis and the graphical presentations are crucial, as they can help both researchers and practitioners to better understand the state of the art of sustainable tourism in the experiential and digital era.;18;Computer;Ref131;Q2;2019
Open innovation has become well established as a new imperative for organizing innovation. In line with the increased use in industry, it has also attracted a lot of attention in academia. However, understanding the full benefits and possible limits of open innovation still remains a challenge. We draw on strategic management theory to describe some of these benefits and limits. More specifically, we develop a dynamic capabilities framework as a way to better understand the strategic management of open innovation, which can then help to better explain both success and failure in open innovation. With this background, as guest editors we introduce select papers published in this Special Section of California Management Review that were originally presented at the fifth annual World Open Innovation Conference, held in San Francisco, California, in December of 2018.;3;Business;Ref132;Q1;2019
Even in today's turbulent business environment, there are companies in many industries that have enjoyed decades of relatively undisturbed success. However, eventually, after such prolonged periods of calm, existing market positions are challenged. We describe such companies as 'Sleeping Beauties' and discuss how they can reinvent themselves through opening up of their boundaries and moving from compartmentalized exploitation and exploration efforts to a more dynamic ambidexterity model. We analyse Swarovski's open innovation journey in this regard, instigated as a response to recent changes in its business environment. Our analysis of this process offers useful insights for companies struggling with similar problems.;3;Business;Ref133;Q1;2019
This paper builds new theory and provides supporting evidence to contain the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS) - a persistent decision-making error arising from an attitude-based bias against external knowledge. Conceptually, we draw on the 4i framework of organizational learning to develop a novel process perspective on NIHS. This allows us not only to unpack how and where NIHS impedes organizational learning, but also to identify the key requirements for effective NIHS countermeasures. Importantly, countermeasures fall into two categories: those that seek to change the negative attitude directly (direct NIHS countermeasures) and those that seek to attenuate the behavioral impact of negative attitudes without addressing the attitudes as such (indirect NIHS countermeasures). While the evidence base on direct NIHS countermeasures has grown over the last decade, indirect NIHS countermeasures have received little research attention. To address this gap, we adopt a mixed methods research design composed of two complementary empirical studies - the first qualitative and the second quantitative. Study 1 explores the prevalence of distinct NIHS countermeasures in collaborative R&D practice. Based on 32 interviews and three focus group meetings with R&D employees, we find that a broad array of primarily direct NIHS countermeasures is employed in R&D practice. Study 2 addresses the scarcity of scholarly and managerial insights on indirect NIHS countermeasures by testing the effectiveness of perspective taking as a debiasing technique to contain negative attitudes at the level of the individual. Based on quantitative survey data from 565 global R&D projects, it provides empirical evidence not only for the prevalence and negative effects of NIHS on project success as mediated by external knowledge absorption, but also for the effectiveness of perspective taking as an exemplary indirect NIHS countermeasure.;3;Business;Ref134;Q1;2019
This article investigates how project expertise and complexity jointly impact the decision to adopt open or closed innovation. It identifies four different types of open innovation models-crowdsourcing, coopetition, science-based, and network-and explores the varying conditions of project expertise and complexity under which firms tend to adopt a particular type. Using large data analysis from pharmaceutical drug development projects, the authors find that complexity moderates the relationship between project expertise and the choice of open or closed innovation and that levels of complexity and project expertise vary between different open innovation models.;3;Business;Ref135;Q1;2019
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between open innovation (OI) and innovative performance, and to explore the moderating effect of knowledge structure, including component knowledge and architectural knowledge, on this particular relationship. Design/methodology/approach The proposed model was tested with regression analysis of data collected through a questionnaire survey of 231 employees of Chinese manufacturing firms. Findings The findings indicate that inbound OI is positively related to innovative performance and that outbound OI has an inverted U-shaped effect on innovative performance. By presenting empirical evidence of the moderating effects of component and architectural knowledge, our analysis of results demonstrates that the strong alignment between knowledge structure and OI results in superior innovative performance. Originality/value This study addresses the controversial issues brought up by previous studies with findings of an inverted U-shaped effect of outbound OI on innovative performance. By exploring the moderating effect of knowledge structure, the authors provide insights into how internal contextual factors in relation to organizational knowledge can affect the efficacy of the inbound and outbound OI on innovative performance.;3;Business;Ref136;Q1;2019
"Purpose Open innovation (OI) has become increasingly popular as an enterprise strategy in both industry and academia, and has been adopted, at least in part, by many companies. Despite this popularity, there is a dearth of evaluation of OI efficiency and a lack of suitable quantitative indices. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the authors used both data envelopment analysis (DEA) and Malmquist techniques to compare the pre- and post-transition levels of performance achievement of Procter & Gamble (P&G), a widely recognised and public early adopter of OI, with a group of its main competitors. Findings Most detailed analysis of the time-course revealed that the innovation efficiency of P&G improved rapidly and substantially after its embracing of OI, an effect we term the ""open rise"". However, there is also a transient decline in R&D efficiency at the beginning of OI adoption (""open dip"") and an unexpected and marked decline (""open drop"") after the peak positive effect. Originality/value The quantitative methods appear to meet the needs identified in the preceding literature for more quantitative approaches to the measurement of OI.";3;Business;Ref137;Q2;2019
Building on the Open Innovation (OI) framework, the purpose of this paper is to examine the R&D inbound model of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Specifically, we focus on the impact of different horizontal R&D collaborations on product innovation and innovation performance. Hypotheses are tested using a Probit/Tobit regression on an Italian sample of 2591 manufacturing SMEs. Our analysis shows that collaborating with different horizontal R&D partners brings to different innovation outcomes. In particular, R&D collaboration with universities has a positive impact on product innovation, but not on innovation performance. Whereas, R&D collaboration with research centres and other private companies has a positive impact on both product innovation and innovation performance. Our findings provide implications for SMEs managers and entrepreneurs who have to decide between R&D partners for their innovation strategy. Avenues for future research are discussed.;3;Business;Ref138;Q2;2020
Purpose Open innovation is important for technology firms as they can use freely available resources to source creative and innovative ideas. Despite the usefulness of open innovation for technological advancements, few studies have focused on the role of cybercrime in affecting an organizations strategic direction. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of open innovation on cybercrime in technology firms. Design/methodology/approach Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted on technology firms to understand the role of open innovation in terms of technology scouting, horizontal collaboration and vertical collaboration on cybercrime activity. Findings The study found that there is a dilemma most technology firm's face in having an open innovation strategy and how to manage cybercrime. This means that a coopetition strategy is utilized that helps to not only balance the need to have open innovation but also protect intellectual property. Originality/value This paper is one of the first to link open innovation strategy to cybercrime activity in technology firms. Thus, it contributes to the literature on open innovation and cyber theft and security.;13;Information;Ref139;Q1;2019
Car-hailing platform governance is an emerging topic of research and practice. The governance of the data-driven platform economy is challenging the research paradigm of competition regulation in the context of open innovation. This research is trying to reveal the market allocation structure of China's online car-hailing industry from the perspective of personal data allocation by the study of Application Programming Interface (API) of sample platforms. On the basis of the networked nature of personal data allocation via APIs, this research constructs a mathematical model of the edge weight of data resource connections between platforms. Furthermore, this research optimises the structural hole analysis of complex networks to discuss the state of personal data resource allocation in China's car-hailing industry. Results reveal that there are obvious structural holes within the sample network. When compared with related indicators, we found that accessing personal data resources is an essential component of the sample network competition capability and sustainable innovation. Social media platforms and online payment platforms more greatly impact car-hailing platform competition than other types of platforms within the multi-sided market context. This research offers a research perspective of personal data allocation for further study of competition, regulation and sustainable innovation of data-driven platform economies.;18;Computer;Ref140;Q2;2019
This paper theorizes how change agents in large firms enact open innovation with small firms. The open innovation change agent is highlighted as a key internal actor for the transformational work needed to put open innovation into practice. The paper presents an empirically grounded theoretical model of how these actors work, emphasizing the two activities of 'anchoring' and 'navigating', with the purpose of bridging the inside and outside of the corporation. In applying a paradox perspective on open innovation enactment, it is explained how these change agents act as both catalysts and guards for collaboration, continuously balancing different paradoxical demands. Theoretical and managerial implications in relation to these findings are discussed.;3;Business;Ref141;Q1;2020
Open innovation has rendered increased interest both in practice and research, and has expanded from dyadic transfers of ideas, to ecosystem levels. Knowledge is at the heart of open innovation, and this paper describes and discusses knowledge-transfer linkages for open innovation. It does so based on a literature review. The paper links together open innovation research with general management research to categorise and discuss linkages among parties in terms of their openness and how they relate to knowledge management. Conclusions indicate that openness needs to be considered in different dimensions that also links to different knowledge management outcomes. The paper's contribution consists of how it connects open innovation research to the general management literature, and how it builds a practical understanding of how linkages between firms can be categorised to aid firms to consider which mechanisms they may choose and why.

The increasing complexity of products and services, rapidly changing market demands, or growing pressure from various societal groups are trends that require companies to enact new practices to remain competitive. The external search for information and its integration in the context of open innovation is one practice that can lead to increased success. However, the full range of potential open innovation partners has not yet been sufficiently explored, and their effects on innovation performance remain unclear. In this research, we investigated the roles different open innovation partners played in improving economic innovation performance and sustainability innovation performance. Furthermore, we asked whether striving to meet economic and sustainability innovation goals represents a conflict. Drawing on a cross-sectional sample of industrial firms and applying a benchmark approach to identify the relevant performance drivers, we found that, in addition to well-known partners such as universities and customers, increased collaboration with NGOs and intermediaries is beneficial for firms. Moreover, economic innovation performance positively correlates with sustainability innovation performance. This implies that economic and sustainability innovation goals can be reached simultaneously. Thereby, this paper contributes to the open innovation literature by revealing which collaboration partners fit best to strengthen innovation performance, and by clarifying the relationship between economic and sustainability innovation performance.

"This study examines the emerging organizational concept of Crowd sourcing where new idea submissions from outside the firm's boundaries are obtained, selected, evaluated, coded, and integrated into the organization. This research is developed through a case study of a large European pharmaceutical company 'PharmaFX', we investigate the process of the interactions between the host company and its collaborators. The Crowdsourcing activities conducted in 2014 and 2015 are presented and acquired benefits are reported on from the perspective of transaction cost. One of our central findings provide newly discovered evidence that the process of ""scientific Ideation Challenge"" as seen planned and implemented in PharmaFX in collaboration with InnoCentive - a reputable Crowdsourcing platform intermediary - have unique process characteristics, became less economically viable for PharmaFX than anticipated, this was partly due to the broadness of the scope of the Crowdsourcing initiatives. These findings could have a significant impact on future open innovation strategies and their economic viability in drug development. (C) 2018 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge.

In this paper, we explain the analytics of a particular type of mechanism of open innovation (OI), namely the management of non-pecuniary exchange of information, and address the relationship between intellectual property rights (IPRs), particularly patent rights, and OI using a static game-theoretic setting of research and development (R&D) competition. We develop a duopoly model in which for-profit firms can contribute to downstream improvements to be made by a diverse community of inventors, workers and users of technology by creating knowledge spillovers which the development community employs as an input for its innovative efforts. Although a money market for R&D information does not exist, the commercial firms may appropriate an indirect return on innovative efforts. The degree of spillover information is determined endogenously, and equilibria with voluntary revealing may arise in our theoretical model. We show that, surprisingly perhaps, a rise in the strength of patent protection induces the free sharing and dissemination of technological information and other contributions to the OI development of innovations. Conversely, a fall in the strength of the patent system induces the exercise of traditional IPRs by innovative firms to protect their intellectual assets. (C) 2018 Journal of Innovation & Knowledge.

"Organizations build strategic alliances with other firms with the intent of tapping into partners' resources and capturing long-term value from these relationships. Such partnerships are typically governed by contractual or equity arrangements with clear mutual obligations. More recently, however, organizations have begun to seek strategic partnerships with open innovation communities, which are novel digitally enabled forms of organizing, and where contractual commitments are not possible. Thus, selecting the right open innovation community as an alliance partner becomes a more complex decision. We follow how the organizational decision makers, in two technology firms that were pioneers of forming strategic alliances with open innovation communities, developed metrics around making such decisions. We build upon Shah and Swaminathan's (2008) contingency model of alliance partner selection and consider how it applies to the case of partnering with open innovation communities. This framework was useful in to frame our findings, yet our work recognizes and builds upon two key differences: 1) the evaluation metrics used in selecting an open innovation community were more focused on value creation than value capture; and 2) open ecosystem considerations, and not just partner-specific metrics, featured prominently in this type of alliance partner evaluation. We develop the notions of community and ecosystem health to refer to these new metrics.";3;Business;Ref147;Q1;2019
Integrating insights from the strategic goal literature and the knowledge-based view of the firm, this article proposes that the pursuit of social and economic strategic goals by commercial firms affects their innovation performance through different knowledge sourcing activities. The strategic goals, knowledge sourcing practices, and innovation performance of 1257 Belgian firms are investigated. Results show that both social and economic strategic goals are associated with the use of external information sources, but only the pursuit of social goals inspires firms to engage in external collaboration. No evidence is found of an inherent conflict between social and economic strategic goals. Instead, the two types of goals are independent of each other, that is, an emphasis on social goals does not preclude an emphasis on economic goals and vice versa. Moreover, firms' external knowledge sourcing and innovation performance benefit most when strongly held social goals align with strongly held economic goals. These findings offer new insight into the nature and the effects of goal multiplicity among commercial firms. They open up a new perspective on the potential positive effects of the joint pursuit of social and economic strategic goals instead of seeing them as inherently conflicting, as past research has typically done. We illustrate how social strategic goals can deliver unique benefits to a firm, independently of and in addition to economic strategic goals. Our findings also contribute to the open innovation literature by revealing strategic goals as a driver of firms' knowledge sourcing practices. Our findings suggest that solely emphasizing economic goals may be one reason why firms struggle to implement open innovation practices and do not reap their full benefits. The practical implications of our research are discussed.;3;Business;Ref148;Q1;2019
This study aims to develop the theory of knowledge management and organizational performance within a small and medium enterprise (SME) context using action research (AR) involving a higher education institution (HEI) and an SME. The vehicle for the knowledge exchange was Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs), the United Kingdom's primary mechanism for delivering government funded knowledge transfer to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). KTPs facilitate knowledge exchange from HEIs to SMEs via the recruitment of a graduate plus an academic supervisor from the partnering HEI. The AR study was an award-winning KTP and the project deliverable included the implementation of a balanced scorecard for the SME to improve organizational performance. The transfer of knowledge was subsequently fed-back into the university in order to develop a performance framework for measuring the effectiveness of KTP research within the HEI in order to share knowledge and improve effective for other KTP projects.;8;Engineering;Ref149;Q1;2019
Inbound open innovation (IOI) has become a potentially valuable means of gaining competitive advantage and enhancing organizational performance. This article explores how knowledge infrastructure capability (KIC) affects IOI through the moderating role of absorptive capacity. This research conceptualizes and develops three dimensions of KIC (technological, structural and cultural), and tests the relationships between KIC, absorptive capacity and IOI. Data for the study were collected from 125 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) based in France, and the relationships proposed in the framework were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate that higher levels of KIC can lead to enhanced absorptive capacity and improved IOI. That is, KIC can have a direct, positive impact on absorptive capacity and IOI. Moreover, absorptive capacity partially mediates the linkage between KIC and IOI. The article contributes to the conceptualization of the impact of KIC on IOI, by emphasizing a firm's absorptive capacity. It offers a validated instrument to measure KIC, and provides an empirical evidence of the impact of KIC on absorptive capacity and IOI. This article also extends the extant literature by focusing on KIC and absorptive capacity simultaneously in a model to understand the notion of IOI in the SMEs based in France. This study offers useful guidance for measuring and implementing KIC in a SME context and encourages further research in this area.;8;Engineering;Ref150;Q1;2019
One of the main challenges of open innovation communities is how to create value from shared content either by selecting those ideas that are worthy of pursuit and implementation or by identifying the users' preferences and needs. These tasks can be done manually when there is an overseeable amount of content or by using computational tools when there are massive amounts of data. However, previous studies on text mining have not dealt with the identification of unique attributes, which can be defined as those contributions that are inextricably linked with a specific tag or category within open innovation websites. The uniqueness of these ideas means that they can only be obtained through a selection of one choice among several alternatives. To obtain such unique ideas and thus to also obtain innovations, this paper proposes a novel methodology called co-occurrence differential analysis. The proposed methodology combines traditional co-occurrence analysis with additional statistical processing to obtain the unique attributes and topics associated with different alternatives. The identification of unique content provides valuable information that can reveal the strengths and weaknesses of several options in a comparative fashion.;3;Business;Ref151;Q1;2019
Extant research has found superior performance of firms located in clusters. However, it is unclear whether this is based on mere proximity or other unobserved factors. We extend this literature by developing a framework to examine in what way institutions promote open innovation processes between clustered firms. Specifically, we develop a set of hypotheses to investigate to what extent structural and relational elements in a cluster organization affect the open innovation culture. Our model integrates effects of agglomeration, networks, information asymmetries and trust on open innovation culture. We focus on the underlying organizational norms established in clustered firms in relation to open innovation. Specifically, we measure open innovation culture in terms of not-invented- and not-sold-here syndromes, which is facilitated by the integration of trust and reduced by information asymmetry within the cluster region. We test this framework using novel and unique data from member and non-member firms of a cluster initiative in a German high-tech cluster. Our findings from moderation analysis show that a regulatory body in the cluster significantly influences the emergence of both inbound and outbound open innovation activities by member firms in the cluster initiative through increased effects of trust and information asymmetries. Thereby, our paper contributes to literatures of open innovation, including networks of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), and cluster policy.;3;Business;Ref152;Q1;2019
Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face the inherent tension of depending on external partners to complement their internal innovation activities while having limited resources to manage such open innovation processes. Given the importance of collaborative efforts between multiple stakeholders, we address the open innovation challenges from the SME perspective at the business-ecosystem level. We present an inductive case study of a particular regional ecosystem and focus on the inter-organizational collaboration between SMEs and other stakeholders in the ecosystem. With this focus, we explore how SMEs perceive, organize, and manage open innovation through strong collaborative ties with other ecosystem members. We identify a particular set of challenges for the SMEs due to the misalignment between their business model and that of their ecosystem. Specific findings include the link between innovation type expressed by diverging understandings of the notion of innovation across the ecosystem and the innovation form (here, open innovation), which should be organized and managed on multiple levels of analysis (SME, inter-organizational, and ecosystem). These findings highlight specific attention points for managing and developing open innovation in a regional business ecosystem, and they contribute both to the business-ecosystem literature as well as open innovation literature.;3;Business;Ref153;Q1;2019
"As the paradigm of open innovation continues to proliferate in both academia and practice especially for the last decade, many studies have attempted to investigate patterns of open innovation. However, empirical and quantitative approaches to monitoring the patterns of open innovation are less conducted because of the difficulty in data collection and the lack of effective methods. Also, it is difficult to identify the patterns of open innovation when there are many cases of open innovation in a wide range of technology areas. In this respect, this paper aims to quantitatively monitor the patterns of open innovation using the patent-based brokerage analysis in the case of mobile communications technology. Using patent citation information, the knowledge flow between technology fields and firms is identified, especially for structuring the open innovation network of 5G technology. Then, the patent-based brokerage analysis based on the open innovation network is conducted to extract brokerage patents that present the patterns of open innovation: inbound and outbound innovation. Furthermore, the brokerage firms are explored to recommend the partnerships in the open innovation network. According to the results, it is expected that ""strategy for open innovation dynamics"" is systematically formulated based on the brokerage patents and partners in various technology areas.";3;Business;Ref154;Q1;2019
"With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the role of entrepreneurs has become more crucial than ever. As a result, an open innovation model is suggested here that can promote serial entrepreneurs by answering the following question: ""How does the serial entrepreneur in open innovation conditions continuously identify business opportunities?"" This question is answered through an in-depth case study of Medison from 1985 to 2016, as Medison is not only a representative Korean medical device company, but is also a representative example of serial entrepreneurship in Korea. First, we examined the diverse open innovation channels, such as spin-offs, venture investment, and joint venture, used by Medison before it was merged with Samsung. Second, we examined the open innovation serial entrepreneurs of Medison and then analyzed the direct serial entrepreneurs of Medison. Fourth, we built a causal loop model of Medison open innovation with emergence and complexity combined. Finally, a sustainable open innovation strategy and an approach to sustainable serial entrepreneurship was formulated. The foundation of this research is as follows. First, an open innovation strategy can be a strong motivator for serial entrepreneurs. Second, a balance between emergence and complexity is required to trigger sustainable serial entrepreneurs of open innovation.";18;Computer;Ref155;Q2;2019
This paper shows the effects of training entrepreneurial competences on employability in higher education. It identifies teaching methods that are more effective in order to improve entrepreneurial competences. These are hackathon, team building, role play, and practical cases with entrepreneurs at a Spanish university. In contrast to the methods shown in previous literature, a mixed-method is proposed. Firstly, a qualitative technique based on three focus groups with the participation of lecturers, students, and entrepreneurs are used. Additionally, a regression analysis seeks links between entrepreneurial intention and employability with entrepreneurial competences with 329 students. The findings show the direct effect on skills appreciated in companies, using collaborative and practical activities focusing on competency perspective. This research work provides a new approach to training entrepreneurial competences that demonstrates the main role of Open Innovation enhancing the main stakeholders' motivation and improving their skills. Useful information is provided to design the academic syllabuses and improve the level of employability of university graduates.;18;Computer;Ref156;Q2;2019
Open innovation communities (OICs) can help enterprises make full use of external knowledge resources from users, but problems such as low user participation and low conversion rate of creative ideas impact the efficiency of OICs. Most studies on this topic employ qualitative or empirical methods from a static perspective, but ignore the effect of interaction between enterprises and users as well as the cumulative effect of time. A discussion on the dynamic evolution process of open innovation is lacking. Based on a review of the literature on OICs, innovation performance, and system dynamics, this study proposes a conceptual model of innovation performance impact, which comprises the knowledge management, governance mechanism, and user behavior subsystems. Xiaomi's OIC in China was selected as the research object, and relevant data were collected through a web spider. According to the system dynamics modeling method, a causal relationship analysis was carried out on the three aforementioned interrelated subsystems. Then, a stock flow chart with 32 variables was constructed to determine the initial values and calculation equations for each variable. Finally, the model was constructed and verified using Vensim PLE software. The simulation results were as follows. (1) The number of product releases in the Xiaomi OIC was positively correlated with the number of posts, comments, and views. Compared with user interaction behavior (i.e., commenting and viewing), the impact of user innovation behavior (i.e., posting) on enterprise innovation performance (i.e., number of patents) is clearer. Specifically, regarding interaction behavior, the impact of the users' commenting behavior on innovation performance (i.e., number of product releases) was relatively clearer than that of their viewing behavior. (2) Governance mechanism (i.e., R&D investment and management expense), which comprises technical and organizational mechanisms, positively affected the innovation performance of enterprises. Compared with the organizational mechanism (i.e., management expense), the impact of the technical mechanism (i.e., R&D investment) on the innovation performance was clearer. (3) Governance mechanism helped to increase the number of users in the OIC, and, in turn, affected the user innovation and interaction behavior. (4) The technical mechanism positively affected knowledge application capability, which, in turn, had a positive impact on the innovation performance of enterprises. Based on these findings, management strategies are proposed for the establishment and development of OICs.;18;Computer;Ref157;Q2;2019
While the research on open innovation is flourishing, less attention has so far been given to 'outbound' processes in comparison to 'inbound' and 'coupled' open innovation. In this paper we analyze a qualitative case study of the global bio-pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and their attempt to establish a spinout initiative where internal projects are transferred to entrepreneurial startups funded by external venture capital. We explain the enactment work of this initiative and identify three emerged managerial challenges, linked to (1) internal decision-making, (2) the cultural and psychological barriers of what we phrase as the 'not-invented-elsewhere' (NIE) syndrome, and (3) the ability to translate and communicate internal projects as attractive external proposals. Theoretical and managerial implications in relation to these challenges are outlined and discussed.;3;Business;Ref158;Q1;2019
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the theoretical background on how organizational change (OC) enhances open innovation (OI) processes and enables a company to reach performance results through implementing knowledge sharing platforms (KSPs). The authors aim to better understand and investigate how the changes introduced by the implementation of KSPs impact the OC and facilitate the OI process. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, an exploratory longitudinal single case study based on a variety of data sources is used: participant observations, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews with the KSP members and top managers of a Tunisian SME operating in the dairy products sector. The open-ended responses were subsequently exposed to thematic discourse analysis. Findings The case study findings deeply explore and investigate a company's experience in implementing OCs when using a joint-venture alliance with a French leader to develop OI. Central to this exhibit is the nature and magnitude of the knowledge sharing between the parties in the OI process, and the significant impact it had on the consumers' reception of the new products. The outcomes show that due to the sharing of external research and development skills, the creation of the KSP has been an incentive for significant changes and customer targeting and for promoting internal absorptive capacity, minimizing complexity, uncertainty and risks and reaching performance results. Originality/value This paper provides a deep understanding of the new product development process and offers a holistic approach with respect to KSP practices. The significant impact on the consumers' first response and the subsequent adaption of an industrially produced cheese as a subsidiary product to an existing artisan quality product are examined in this study. Examining the implementation of an OI process, this research is one of the few studies revealing the shortcomings of a former process and a subsequent adaption of a newly successful one that targets the consumers in a MENA country.;3;Business;Ref159;Q2;2019
Purpose Open innovation (OI) involves the alignment of the organisation's strategy and resources. Notably, companies will not adopt this emerging paradigm without a guarantee of better results. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify which combination of entrepreneurial managerial approaches makes it possible for companies to improve performance. Design/methodology/approach This study involves a survey questionnaire, 147 enterprises and regression analysis on the survey data to identify to what extent strategic and management orientations affect innovation performance (IP), as well as an analysis focusing on the results of two sectors (i.e. tourism and agri-food industries). Findings The main findings show a direct effect amongst the level of innovation, external openness and open innovation management (OIM), and IP. However, although there are no differences in the perception and orientation of OIM and the results across the two sectors, the influence of the variable firm size has been supported. Finally, the collective effort required by companies to ensure the successful implementation of OI processes and achieve high IP is outstanding. Practical implications - This paper discusses the significance of these findings, highlighting the main practical implications for researchers and companies - especially the need to assimilate the organisational change involved in the challenge of OI. Originality/value This study combines the sectors industry and services, emphasises OIM and reinforces the literature in the field of IP.;3;Business;Ref160;Q2;2019
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of open innovation (OI) cooperation strategies on innovation outcomes of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), considering the mediating effect of firm age. The data come from six Spanish regions in the period 2009-2011. The authors analyse the impacts of two different types of innovation cooperation (with market and institutional agents) on four types of innovation outcomes: product, process, organisational and marketing. Design/methodology/approach The analytical method is based on logit regressions in order to assess the impact of OI variables on SMEs' innovation outcomes. The regressions include a number of control variables related to the characteristics of the business, the entrepreneur and the environment. Findings The empirical results show that OI plays a significant role in explaining the innovation outcome of SMEs. Firm age is found to moderate this relationship. R&D cooperation with market agents exhibits the highest relationship to innovation, while the impact of institutional cooperation is comparatively lower. Originality/value There are few studies on OI addressing OI practices in SMEs. This research contributes to shedding light on the role of OI in innovation processes in SMEs. It also shows how this relationship changes depending on the partner, the type of innovation and the age of the firm.;3;Business;Ref161;Q2;2019
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to provide interested parties with the means of grasping how the literature on open innovation has evolved over the course of time. In this way, the authors furthermore contribute towards a better understanding, scaling and positioning of this field of research. Design/methodology/approach This study applies a combination of bibliometric techniques, such as citations, co-citations and social network analysis in order to map the scientific domain of open innovation. Currently, bibliometric analysis represents a methodology in effect on a global scale to evaluate the existing state of fields of research (Mutschke et al., 2011). This spans the application of quantitative and statistical analysis to publications such as articles and their respective citations and serving to evaluate the performance of research through returning data on all of the activities ongoing in a scientific field with summaries of these data generating a broad perspective on the research activities and impacts, especially as regards the researchers, journals, countries and universities (Hawkins, 1977; Osareh, 1996; Thomsom Reuters, 2008). Findings This research aims to map and analyse the intellectual knowledge held on open innovation. To this end, the authors carried out a bibliometric study with recourse to co-citations. Based on cluster and factorial analyses, it is possible identify and classify the several theoretical perspectives on open innovation across six areas: open innovation concept, open innovation and networks, open innovation and knowledge, open Innovation, and innovation spillovers, open innovation management and open innovation and technology. Originality/value This paper aims to map and analyse the intellectual knowledge held on open innovation.";3;Business;Ref162;Q2;2019
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand how Open Innovation Digital Platforms (OIDPs) can facilitate and support knowledge co-creation in Open Innovation (OI) processes. Specifically, it intends to investigate the contribution of OIDPs-oriented to successfully implement all the phases of interactive coupled OI processes. Design/methodology/approach The paper carries out an exploratory qualitative analysis, adopting the single case study method. The case here investigated is Open Innovation Platform Regione Lombardia (OIPRL). Findings The case study sheds light on how OIPRL supports knowledge co-creation through its processes, tools and services as a co-creator intermediary. In its launch stage, the platform simply aimed at giving firms a tool to ""find partners"" and financial resources to achieve innovative projects. Now, however, the platform has developed into an engagement platform for knowledge co-creation. Research limitations/implications - One limitation lies in the particular perspective used to perform the case study: the perspective of the digital platform itself. Future research should focus on the individuals engaged in the platform to better investigate the processes, tools and services used to implement the OI approach. Practical implications - The paper suggests ways in which OIDPs could be used by firms for effective exploration, acquisition, integration and development of valuable knowledge. Originality/value The study conceptualizes the role of OIDPs in shaping knowledge co-creation, assuming that the platforms act as Open Innovation Intermediaries (OIIs). Specifically, OIDPs can be observed to function as ""co-creator intermediaries"" that define, develop and implement dedicated processes, specific tools and appropriate services for supporting knowledge co-creation activities.";3;Business;Ref163;Q1;2019
Responding to the lack of empirical research on the effect of collective intelligence on open innovation in the fourth industrial revolution, we examined the relationship between collective intelligence and open innovation. Collective intelligence or crowd innovation not only produces creative ideas or inventions, but also moderates any firm to innovate inside-out, outside-in, or in a coupled manner. We asked the following research questions: Does collective intelligence (or crowd innovation) motivate open innovation? Is there any difference in the effect of collective intelligence on open innovation by industry? These research questions led to the following three hypotheses: (1) Collective intelligence increases the performance of a firm, (2) collective intelligence will moderate the effect of open innovation, and (3) differences exist between the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industry in these two effects. To empirically examine these three hypotheses, we analyzed the registered patents of these two industries from 2000 to 2014 over a 15-year period. These automotive and pharmaceutical patents were registered in the B60 category and the A61K category of the Korea Patent office, respectively. Collective intelligence was measured by co-invention. We found differences in the effects of collective intelligence on open innovation between the two industries. In the automotive industry, collective intelligence not only directly increased the performance, but also indirectly moderated the open innovation effect. However, this was not the case for the pharmaceutical industry.;18;Computer;Ref164;Q2;2019
Advancement of the digital economy has transformed the concept of the growth crossover in nations and firms, both concerning input and output. Advanced economies have been confronting a dilemma between input increases and output decreases. Contrary to traditional expectations, excessive increase in input has resulted in a productivity decline in output. A solution to this dilemma can only be expected by harnessing the vigor of soft innovation resources that lead to neo open innovation in the digital economy. This paper attempts to demonstrate this hypothetical view. Based on an empirical analysis of the development trajectories of 140 countries and 500 global ICT firms, dynamism, resulting in bipolarization between a virtuous cycle and a vicious cycle between input increases and productivity enhancement, was discovered. Furthermore, an empirical analysis focusing on the development trajectories of two world ICT leaders, Finland and Singapore, identified a mechanism of neo open innovation that assimilates soft innovation resources into a national production system. This mechanism can substitute for research and development (R&D) and removes structural impediments to growth while providing relief from the increasing burden of R&D investment. The above findings provide insightful suggestions for drafting a roadmap towards neo open innovation in the digital economy.;19;Social;Ref165;Q2;2019
"Amazon was the world's top Research and Development (R&D) firm in 2017. Its R&D investment was double that of 2015, five times that of 2012, and ten times that of 2011. Such a rapid and notable increase in R&D investment has raised the question of a new R&D definition and focus in the digital economy, which Amazon insists includes both ""routine or periodic alterations"" (traditionally classified as non-R&D) and ""significant improvement"" (classified as R&D). Using an empirical analysis of Amazon's R&D model as a system, this paper attempts to provide a convincing answer to this question. It has been identified that Amazon, which is based on R&D as a culture, has been promoting company wide experimentation to cause customers obsessed with making purchase decisions. This obsession has enabled Amazon to deploy an architecture for participation that makes the most of digital technologies by harnessing the power of users. Such user-driven innovation has accelerated a dramatic advancement of the Internet that, in turn, has accelerated the co-emergence of soft innovation resources in the marketplace. This emergence has activated a self-propagating function that has induced functionality development, leading to supra-functionality beyond an economic value that satisfies a shift in customers' preferences. While this system depends on the assimilation capacity of soft innovation resources, Amazon has developed a high level of capacity supported by a rapid and notable increase in R&D investment. The above efforts function in a virtuous cycle leading to the transformation of ""routine or periodic alterations"" into ""significant improvement."" These findings give rise to insightful suggestions regarding a new concept of R&D in neo open innovation in the digital economy.";19;Social;Ref166;Q2;2019
Recent studies suggest that the effectiveness of open innovation (OI) can significantly differ among firms. One possible reason is the different ways of implementing OI strategies. Another is the ignorance of the explicit role of business model (BM). In this study, we integrate the two plausible explanations by exploring the impact of the interplay between different OI implementations and BM on firms' new product development (NPD) speed. Empirical results from a survey of 265 Chinese firms show that both OI breadth and OI depth positively affect NPD speed. More importantly, we find that an efficient BM strengthens the positive effect of OI depth while it weakens the positive effect of OI breadth. We also find that a novel BM strengthens the positive effect of OI breadth while it weakens the positive effect of OI depth. This research contributes to OI literature by underscoring the importance of matching the BMs to the OI strategies to facilitate NPD.;8;Engineering;Ref167;Q1;2019
The inbound open innovation (OI) process consists of the opening of the innovation funnel to the contribution of external partners, with the aim of tapping into their knowledge. This opportunity is particularly valuable for family firms (FFs), which often have insufficient resources. However, the literature on the OI behaviour of family firms is not conclusive. Indeed, both the behavioural theory (BT) and the resource-based view (RBV) posit negative and positive outcomes regarding openness choices in FFs. We claim that these contrasting results can be reconciled if, according to the literature, FFs are seen as a heterogeneous breed, whose differences are determined by different levels of participation of non-family members in the governance mechanisms. Indeed, non-family members can act in favour of OI. However, previous literature has failed to satisfactorily grasp the nuances of this heterogeneity. We suggest that it is necessary to adequately operationalize the heterogeneity concept by means of fuzzy logic. We conducted a survey on 178 Italian FFs. Results show that the involvement of non-family members affects the extent to which firms draw on knowledge from external partners. Specifically, the higher the involvement of non-family members, the more there is collaboration with vertical partners along the supply chain.;3;Business;Ref168;Q1;2019
"Purpose Currently, it is commonly accepted that information technology capabilities (ITC) positively influence organizational agility. Nevertheless, studies have recently started to demonstrate that different organizational factors mediate this relation under the controvertible assumption that companies are capable of responding quickly to market changes using their IT in combination with other internal resources. Therefore, companies have given very little attention to collaborative work with external partners. The purpose of this study is to analyze the mediating effects of the acquisition and exploitation capabilities of open innovation on the information technology capabilities - organizational agility relationship. Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed model with survey data from a multinational corporation that operates in South American emerging economies in the pension and savings businesses. Findings This study found that only the open innovation capability of exploitation has a partial mediating effect. This means that this organizational ability serves as a bridge so that IT capabilities can have a positive incidence on organizational agility. Originality/value This paper adopts a more novel study focus that emphasizes the importance of collaborative work and of the use of external resources that are implicit in open innovation capability. On the other hand, this organizational ability implies external embeddedness, which is usually approached mainly from the network theory in the international business literature; however, this study offers a more interesting study focus in which externally oriented organizational abilities such as open innovation are more important for external embeddedness than are the size and quality of the external network.";3;Business;Ref169;Q1;2019
Over the past decade, open innovation has seemingly become the dominant approach for revitalising a company's innovation process. Can open innovation improve firm performance? This study optimises the measures for open innovation based on existing literature and by considering the actual situation in China. We draw conclusions from an analysis of 516 annual reports and data from Wind of 172 biopharmaceutical companies from 2013 to 2015. Result indicates that open innovation strategies have different effects at different times: (1) Inbound open innovation has a negative impact on short-term (1-2 years) firm performance, but an inverted U-shaped curvilinear relationship will develop after about 3 years. (2) Outbound open innovation has a negative impact on short-term firm performance, but leaves a positive effect in the long run. Therefore, enterprises should maintain a moderate inbound open innovation level and improve the degree of outbound open innovation to improve long-term performance.;3;Business;Ref170;Q2;2019
In this study, the effects of open innovation practices on enterprise value were discussed based on the supply chain perspective. A nonlinear programming mode was constructed considering the uncertainty of open innovation effect. On this basis, the prototype was analyzed using a robust optimization approach with comprehensive considerations to the infeasible probability of constraint and goal accuracy. Findings show that parameter Gamma could convert the nonlinear programming model with uncertainty into a robust model with a strong stability. Furthermore, Gamma could be used to regulate the preference of the manufacturer to profit and the uncertainties in innovative practices. A small Gamma indicates manufacturers can refer to more information, and the manufacturers are more inclined to amass production, so the profit is larger. Meanwhile, a high Gamma means that manufacturers can refer to less information, so that they pay more attention to making the product output adapt to the uncertainty of innovative effect. Manufacturers could select the appropriate Gamma value and reasonably arrange the production outputs of different goods according to the technological level of open innovation subject and their preference to profit and uncertainty. These conclusions were verified by a case study. In this work, the uncertainty of the open innovation effect was investigated from the supply chain perspective, which is of important significance to the decision making on optimal supply chain output and innovation risk control under an uncertain environment.;5;Computer;Ref171;Q2;2019
Inbound open innovation has become a prevalent innovation strategy used to strengthen firms' technology competitiveness in the fast-changing industrial and technological environment. The effective governance of firms' ego-centered innovation networks to facilitate and accelerate inbound open innovation practice is the main concern of scholars and firm leaders. In this paper, we elucidate the impact of network embeddedness on inbound open innovation practice by considering technology duster an important moderator. We conduct a patent citation network analysis and a hierarchical regression analysis to empirically study the patent citation data of four emerging high-tech industries according to the stages of their industrial technology development. Our results show that during the initial and growth stages of industrial technology development, the centrality and network reach of a firm's network embeddedness exert a positive impact on the inbound open innovation practice. This relationship is positively moderated by clustering and the bridging ties of the technology cluster in which the firm is involved. During the stable stage, only the network reach improves firms' inbound open innovation practice, while centrality becomes a hazard. Furthermore, clustering decreases the negative effect of centrality and enhances the positive effect of network reach. Bridging ties show no moderating effect. Our findings deepen the understanding of scholars and practitioners regarding how inbound open innovation practice varies in different innovation network settings at both the firm and cluster levels.;3;Business;Ref172;Q1;2019
The technological catch-up behaviour of latecomer firms has been a topic of interest for the past three decades, especially in emerging economies, such as China and India. However, little research has systematically discussed the capability-upgrading issue that firms face in the context of open innovation, and the previous work lacks an explanation for why some Chinese firms can win competitive advantages in the global market within a short time. This study develops a PDSE (Position-Depth-Scope-Efficiency) framework of systemic catch-up to explain the process and mechanism of capability upgrading by using the literature on technological catch-up, open innovation, and the capability reconfiguration view. We conduct a multiple-case study based on three top home appliance manufacturers in China- Haier Group, Midea Group, and Gree Electronics. The results show that firms can achieve better positions, depth, and scope of catch-up with higher efficiency in the open innovation era. The process of systemic catch-up moves from component capability to architectural capability and then to systemic capability, while four mechanisms based on market and technology reconfigurations are effective in promoting capability upgrading. Overall, a key contribution of this paper is the offering of a new conceptual framework of systemic catch-up to outline the changes in the capability-upgrading process over time. This framework adds to the previous research that is mainly limited to the entry and gradual catch-up stages of capability development and deepens the understanding of the competitiveness of emerging economy firms beyond cost and scale advantages.;3;Business;Ref173;Q1;2019
In this paper, we study the effects of inter-firm linkages on the open innovation of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from an innovation ecosystem perspective. Based on resource dependence theory and the bipartite structure of business ecosystems, we divide a SME's external linkages with its partners in an innovation ecosystem into two types (i.e. the Linkages of a SME with its Prominent Organizations (LPO) and the Linkages of the SME with its Service Intermediaries (LSI)). We then examine the relationships between LPO (and LSI) and the SME's innovation performance and analyze the influences of the SME's absorptive capacity on the two relationships. Research results support a positive relationship between LPO and SMEs' innovation performance, and a positive relationship between LSI and SMEs' innovation performance and a positive relationship between LSI and LPO. In addition, research results show that when measured by R&D intensity, SMEs' absorptive capacity weakens the positive effects of LPO (and LSI) on SMEs' innovation performance, whereas when measured by IT adoption, SMEs' absorptive capacity strengthens the two positive relationships. Relevant theoretical and managerial contributions are discussed.;3;Business;Ref174;Q1;2019
"Firms are increasingly leveraging social media tools to access knowledge from external actors, particularly customers and other users, to facilitate the innovation process and firm performance. Yet empirical research investigating the impact of external knowledge sourced via social media tools is scant; empirical studies that do exist are mixed, leading to calls for research into the conditions under which knowledge flows via social media from external actors contribute to innovation and firm performance. Using a large-scale survey of firms in Tasmania, Australia, this study examines how external knowledge flows from market-based actors sourced by social media influence innovation and business performance, and the extent to which modem human resource management (HRM) practices moderate this relationship. We find that while knowledge flows from market-based actors are positively related to innovativeness, the relationship between external knowledge flows via social media and innovativeness depends on the importance a firm places on modern HRM practices: a significant positive relationship exists between knowledge sourced via social media and innovativeness when firms attach high importance to modern HRM practices. In contrast, there is no significant relationship in firms in which modem HRM practices are of low importance. The study also shows that social media serves as a mediator for the effect of external knowledge flows on firm innovativeness when firms attach high importance to modern HRM practices. Furthermore, while the results demonstrate that innovativeness and firm performance are positively related, innovativeness does not translate into improved firm performance in firms that attach low importance to modern HRM practices. Taken together, the findings underscore the importance of modem HRM practices to enable knowledge inflows via social media to influence innovativeness, and innovativeness to translate into productivity benefits.";3;Business;Ref175;Q1;2019
Our study illustrates how scientists contribute to the performance of innovative start-ups through an analysis of 211 Italian start-ups with and without scientist founders. Building upon imprinting theory, we hypothesize and find that scientists provide an advantage to innovative start-ups to the extent that they stimulate open innovation (i.e., search breadth and depth). However, for this to effectively occur, the involvement of multiple scientist founders is needed, so that their career imprints internalized in the lab are successfully transferred to the start-up. Moreover, if the start-up embraces business practices (i.e., strategic planning) or departs from scientific logics (i.e., pursuing non-commercial goals), scientists' contribution is further increased. Therefore, our study illustrates how the scientist career imprint can provide an advantage to innovative start-ups with multiple scientists, but also how it can act as a rigidity if the start-up does not pursue strategic planning or emphasizes non-commercial goals.;3;Business;Ref176;Q1;2019
In recent years, crowdsourcing has emerged as a promising open innovation strategy for firms searching for solutions to technical problems. Previous research has shown that crowdsourcing can provide quick access to distant knowledge at relatively low costs, when compared to other forms of innovation governance such as internal sourcing or contract research. Recent studies, however, indicate that firms differ considerably in their ability to reap the benefits from crowdsourcing. Drawing upon recent work on the microfoundations of capabilities, we hypothesize how three types of lower level organizational elements may affect gains from crowdsourcing: informal organizational roles, formal organizational roles, and knowledge processes. Following a mixed-method research design and drawing on rich quantitative and qualitative data, we find that informal and formal organizational roles work through processes of knowledge articulation and codification in developing a firm's crowdsourcing capability. By going beyond the direct effects of the three antecedents, our research sheds light on the process of capability development for open innovation.;3;Business;Ref177;Q1;2019
"This paper focuses on how companies deploy structural properties of adaptive capacity (multiplexity, redundancy and loose coupling) to cope with the phenomenon of internal challenges of Open Innovation (OI) implementation, i.e. organisational and cultural changes. We developed a single case study, which offered significant findings. First, the multiplexity of relationships in OI settings helps to face the challenges of organisational and cultural changes by triggering trust formation and interaction. Second, redundancy has twofold elements: institutional logics redundancy triggers cultural change challenges which can be overcome through management practices and communications; task redundancy facilitates knowledge sharing and collaboration, thus helping to deal with organisational change challenges. Finally, loose coupling in OI settings facilitates social interconnectedness among members through management practices, helping to face organisational and cultural change challenges. We provide managerial and theoretical implication to deal with the challenges of OI in relation to both organisational and cultural changes.";3;Business;Ref178;Q1;2020
The essence of innovation lies in the utilisation of knowledge. To ensure innovation and sustainability, this study constructs an internal linkage framework for open innovation, knowledge management capability and dual innovation. Research results show that both open innovation and knowledge management capability have a positive influence on dual innovation. The impact of inward-oriented open innovation on exploitation innovation is more prominent than that of outward-oriented open innovation. Whereas the impact of outward-oriented open innovation on exploration innovation is more prominent than that of inward-oriented open innovation. Knowledge management capability partially mediates open innovation and dual innovation while open innovation influences dual innovation.;3;Business;Ref179;Q2;2020
"Cities are increasingly seen as having an important role in tackling societal challenges related to climate change, while open innovation is increasingly accepted as a new way of working for governments. In the current work, we explore the role of open innovation to tackle global challenges on a city level. In the context of the city of Rotterdam and its vision on sustainability and liveability, seven collaborative initiatives are introduced. These initiatives aim to address both sustainability and liveability goals. Our research shows that in order to have these initiatives contribute to the overall municipal goal on sustainability and liveability, the municipality needs to take different roles. Whereas traditional open innovation literature usually distinguishes three main types of open innovation, namely outside-in, inside-out, and coupled processes, the current study shows that open innovation for sustainability in the city needs a much more fine-grained and elaborate perspective; a multi-level open innovation model that allows for different co-creative partnerships joining forces in sustainability challenges. It can be concluded that governments have a key role in infrastructuring these co-creative partnerships.";18;Computer;Ref180;Q2;2019
"The characteristics of collaborative innovation and interactions among core enterprises, users, and partners are critical. Research is lacking on how to construct open innovation ecology through institutional design. This study explores how core enterprises effectively motivate users and partners to participate in innovation activities on the Internet and successfully constructing open innovation ecology, using the institutional logic theory and an exploratory case study of Xiaomi, a famous Chinese Internet enterprise. The findings are as follows: (1) three main characteristics of innovation carried out by core enterprises, users, and partners in the open innovation ecologyiterative innovation, social innovation, and joint innovation; (2) three new institutional practicesfollowing, leading, and symbiotic mechanismswhich provide an effective institutional guarantee for interaction and innovation; (3) two kinds of institutional logicadministrative logic and social logic, which core enterprises follow to construct open innovation ecology on the Internet, and its change in innovation characteristics. Therefore, a full understanding of the changing rules of the institutional logic is fundamental for successfully building open innovation ecology. This study enriches both the open innovation ecology theory as well as the institutional logic theory. In addition, Xiaomi's open innovation ecological development model proves that core enterprises can take the approach of building open innovation ecology. It provides a strong example to other enterprises on innovations on the Internet.";18;Computer;Ref181;Q2;2019
"It is generally accepted that cities and other forms of geographic agglomerations are conducive to innovation because their density and variety of firms, sectors and individuals create a diverse environment. However, a growing body of work shows that innovation also occurs in peripheral regions and small towns. Furthermore, work on rural social networks shows that diversity is multidimensional, and that along certain dimensions networks developed in rural areas are more diverse than those observed in cities. In this paper, we develop these arguments, then report our observations of seven successful firms in Swiss small towns. These firms benefit from at least three types of diversity: internal diversity; multiplexed interactions between workers at different hierarchical levels; and external diversity as firms reach beyond the region. We conclude that diversity conducive to firm-level innovation is not a specifically urban attribute: at least some of its dimensions are present in small towns and more peripheral areas.";6;Development;Ref182;Q3;2019
"This conceptual paper traces the origins and progress of Open Science and proposes its generative coupling to Open Innovation in the contemporary socio-political context; where universities are re-imaging their civic missions in the face of anti-establishment populist politics. This setting is one of changing knowledge production regimes and institutional pressures that create contradictions identifiable through the prism of the series of scientific norms conceptualised by Robert K. Merton. This paper privileges a sociological perspective to proffer scientific knowledge production as a societally embedded process, which is well illustrated by scholarship in the Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Science in Society fields. In doing so, it identifies the co-evolution, co-existence and co-production of Open Science with Open Innovation; and notes how it shares the attributes of other recent diagnoses of changing knowledge production regimes; in particular Mode 2, post-normal science and the Quadruple Helix. It also argues that Open Science can be coupled with Open Innovation to catalyse positive societal change, but that the rise of a populist post-truth era opposed to objectivity, expertise and technocratic political solutions gives the demand for openness and participation a different complexion. Merton's norms provide a useful lens to observe recent shifts in the delivery of science, knowledge and innovation in society towards more inclusive, ethical and sustainable outcomes; and expose the limited reflection on how the appropriation and exploitation of open scientific knowledge encounters industrial R&D and Open Innovation.";3;Business;Ref183;Q1;2019
New open innovation initiatives, such as accelerators, living labs, social innovation labs and open labs, involve for-profit and not-for-profit actors working closely together to co-create both business value and societal impacts. However, there is a lack of theoretical underpinning to understand how and why co-creation by actors generate different types of social value in the concurrent pursuit of business and social value. Adopting an inductive case study approach, we find that different types of entrepreneurs who co-exploit co-identify opportunities for co-creation, generate potentially competing social and business values. We develop four propositions relating to how and why profit orientation and key resource contributions of entrepreneurs co-identifying an opportunity to co-create decide the nature of social value generated. We discuss avenues for future research and practical implications, underlying the importance of developing entrepreneurialism as ways to generate different social impacts through open innovation approaches, such as co-creation.;3;Business;Ref184;Q1;2019
This study explores how a community uses open innovation over time to tackle a global societal challenge. we conduct an in-depth case study of OpenMRS, an open-source software community providing affordable medical record-keeping software in developing nations. We develop a process model that describes how inbound, outbound, and coupled open innovation influenced the community through four discrete phases of community development. We explain how the founders' vision led to the creation of the community, and how increasing community participation and community governance facilitated its growth. Interestingly, we found that economic opportunities made possible by open innovation may paradoxically create challenges to community sustainability. Ultimately, this study expands our understanding of open innovation communities in different settings, and their role in addressing societal challenges.;3;Business;Ref185;Q1;2019
Research on open innovation mostly focuses on company level aspects of this phenomenon and predominantly investigates open innovation in large firms. Individuals and especially leaders play a vital role in the successful implementation of open innovation. However, research on this important issue has only recently begun to flourish, with research showing the vast occurence of open innovation activities among small and medium-sized companies and the vital role entrepreneurs play for open innovation. In this research, we connect the fields of open innovation and entrepreneurship and employ dynamics capability literature to focus on factors on the individual level (entrepreneurs' openness and network closeness), which affect innovation performance and strategic growth intentions of companies through absorptive capacity. We conceptualise a theoretical model and test it on entrepreneurs samples from two countries (Slovenia and United States) by means of structural equation modelling. The results suggest that entrepreneurial openness is an important antecedent of absorptive capacity and that too much focus on maintaining the same business contacts (network closeness) prevents the company from absorbing trends from outside the company and network. We also show that absorptive capacity is positively related to innovation performance and strategic growth intentions. We discuss the implications for theory and practice.;3;Business;Ref186;Q1;2019
Open innovation, as a connection-driven innovation paradigm, provides a set of practices, stimulating collaborative and intrapreneurial actions, while facilitating the rethinking of antiquated business models and value propositions. This research contributes to the extant open innovation and technology management literature by (a) conceptualising outbound open innovation and delineating it into two sub-modes: inward and outward and (b) elucidating the role of outbound open innovation as a vehicle for unrelated diversification and enabler of intrapreneurial aptitude within a technology-driven ecosystem. Fifteen in-depth semi-structured interviews conducted within a leading producer of sensing solutions, illuminate new value-creation narratives, grounded in intra and cross-industry innovation, providing novel research and management insights on utilising outbound open innovation practices as a means of leveraging un/under-utilised organisational resources towards developing diversified commercialised offerings and value-adding capability-based activities.;3;Business;Ref187;Q2;2019
There is widespread agreement that open innovation (OI) is strongly influenced by external partner heterogeneity. While previous studies have examined partner heterogeneity using quantitative analysis, the implications of a weighted assignment using an external partner heterogeneity index have received less attention. The purpose of this study is to develop a modified partner heterogeneity model. Specifically, using a questionnaire survey of Chinese firms, we develop a new method to measure partner organisational heterogeneity (POH). Then, the moderating factors of an industry's technological environment, termed the technological regime, are introduced. The empirical analysis shows that the technological regime is positively correlated with POH and OI performance. Hence, an advanced technological regime improves POH and OI performance by incorporating external resources and increasing innovation potential.;3;Business;Ref188;Q2;2019
The paper aims at analysing the relationships between technological strategies, open innovation adoption and type of innovation output obtained after the knowledge-based perspective. Six hypotheses are generated and tested on 243 companies in R&D intense industries. A patent-based framework is designed for defining the variables under investigation and regression analysis is performed. Open innovation is mostly adopted to pursue exploration and diversification and mainly leads to modular and radical innovation. Incremental innovation is mostly attained through R&D outsourcing, joint development leads to architectural innovation, whereas both the acquisition and the incorporation of external technologies pertain the access to modular and radical innovation. The work suggests scholars to address their interests not only on the open innovation adoption but also on the differences among the various practices that may be employed in opposition to the internal development.;3;Business;Ref189;Q2;2019
As the concept of co-creation has evolved in the innovation management literature its meaning has become ambiguous and the boundaries between it and the concept of open innovation have become opaque. The purpose of this paper is to more clearly define the concept of co-creation and to articulate how it differs from and relates to the concept of open innovation. Scholars are divided as to whether co-creation is a subsidiary concept of open innovation, a surrogate concept that is essentially indistinguishable from open innovation, or a separate concept that developed independently but was subsequently intermingled and interfused with open innovation. This paper addresses this scholarly confusion by conducting a systematic two-stage review of the innovation management literature, commencing with of a 'broad brush' bibliometric analysis, focused on the origins and evolution of co-creation and open innovation, followed by a 'deep dive' literature review in which the two concepts were rigorously compared. By proposing a cogent definition and taxonomy of co-creation, and thereby distinguishing it from open innovation, the paper goes beyond the current state of the literature and provides a more robust basis for future research.;3;Business;Ref190;Q1;2019
Discussions on opportunities and enablers have remained lacking despite the continued growth of business model innovation (BMI) research. In order to investigate the formation mechanism of BMI in small-medium enterprises (SMEs), we proposed an integrated model, which included factors derived from organisational internal resources and capabilities via the resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capabilities view (DCV). Structural equation model (SEM) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) were utilised to test the survey data collected from 245 SMEs in China. SEM results support the hypotheses, except that on the impact of outbound open innovation on market capitalising agility and on BMI. The fsQCA analysis revealed that four configurations of open innovations and organisational agilities can sufficiently explain high levels of BMI, and two configurations of these factors lead to low BMI. The theoretical and practical implications of such findings were also provided.;3;Business;Ref191;Q2;2019
Since the 1990s, external technology commercialization (ETC) has become increasingly relevant in business management practice and the academic literature. Frequently, ETC is praised as highly important and is often even considered an important competence of a progressive firm. To date, research has mainly focused on the opportunities and advantages of ETC, while risks and costs tend to be ignored or downplayed. This paper aims to review ETC critically. We stress that ETC might not only cause operating costs but also requires additional human resources. From a strategic perspective, we propose that ETC may result in the loss of competitive advantages through the disclosure of internal knowledge (or areas the firm is working in) or through the suboptimal allocation of R&D resources, and thereby affects a firm's performance negatively. Finally, we propose specific implications for management and research on when and how often companies should practice ETC, and illustrate related practical experience by a case study. We thereby propose an inversely U-shaped relationship between ETC's intensity and the firm's profit contribution.;3;Business;Ref192;Q1;2019
"Industrial innovation is becoming more open, requiring changes in how firms manage innovation. External sources of knowledge become more prominent, while external channels to market also of,fer greater promise. This complicates the evaluation of early-stage technology projects, which often involve significant technical and market uncertainty. In such circumstances, companies need to ""play poker"" as well as chess. Measurement errors (false positives, false negatives) are likely to arise from judgments about the commercial potential of early-stage projects. Most companies' policies consciously limit ""false positives"" in assessing a project's commercial potential, but few companies take steps to manage the risk of ""false negatives."" New metrics may help a firm focus more upon external sources of innovation to enhance its business model, and enable the firm to salvage value from false negatives that otherwise would be lost.";3;Business;Ref193;Q1;2019
In order to meet the needs of customers and take advantage of the customer's innovative resources, companies open up their design activities of products to customers. In contrast to the traditional product innovation, the primary characteristic of open innovation is the participation of a large number of autonomous individuals across organisational boundaries, and there is not a central authority. Hence, it is necessary to study the dynamic mechanism for obtaining a good decision. This paper first studies the evolution of individual interaction based on game theory and then studies the dynamic characteristics of large-scale interaction. According to the results of simulation, it is concluded that the opinions are convergent under various communication conditions, and he convergent velocity distribution of the product solution with payoffs as the independent variable is obtained. A case study is used to deeply understand the participant behaviour based on the game theory and verify the conclusion of dynamic analysis in this paper.;5;Computer;Ref194;Q1;2019
As people pay attentions to social innovation as the source of innovative ideas and the repository of new business models, this study poses the following research questions: How does a social open innovation succeed? What is the success factor of social open innovation? What are the successful dynamics of social open innovation? This article selected two case studies: one is the Burro Battery Company in Ghana and the other is grassroots innovation enterprise of India known as the Honey Bee Network and its collaborator, National Innovation Foundation (NIF), Ahmedabad. The first case is a social open innovation firm case while the second case is a social open innovation policy case. Through deep case study, we found out the ways of success of social open innovation strategy and social open innovation policy.;3;Business;Ref195;Q2;2019
This paper studies open innovation practices in Russian state-owned enterprises (SOEs). In 2011, the Russian Government set ambitious goals in science, technology and innovation, and uses its large SOEs as channels to achieve these targets. These initiatives focus on the collaboration among innovation actors and introduce open innovation (OI) principles. Based on a large-scale innovation survey, we compare private enterprises to state-owned peers and present selected case studies. Our data support the claim that Russian SOEs are driving the demand for technology and mainly absorb incoming OI activities. Different to their peers, SOEs extend their OI activities to the country's knowledge producers, such as research and technology organisations (RTOs), and leading universities. They work on incorporating scientific knowledge that could, indeed, hold the key to globally competitive technological innovations, but also have better capabilities to include business partners.;3;Business;Ref196;Q1;2019
"Purpose Despite the abundance of research in open innovation, few contributions explore it at inter-organizational level, and particularly with a focus on healthcare ecosystem, characterized by a dense network of relationships among public and private organizations (hospitals, companies and universities) as well as other actors that can be labeled as ""untraditional"" player, i.e. doctors, nurses and patients. The purpose of this paper is to cover this gap and explore how knowledge is transferred and flows among all the healthcare ecosystems' players in order to support open innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach The paper is conceptual in nature and adopts a narrative literature review approach. In particular, insights gathered from open innovation literature at the inter-organizational network level, with a particular attention to healthcare ecosystems, and from the knowledge transfer processes, are analyzed in order to propose an interpretative framework for the understanding of knowledge transfer in open innovation with a focus on healthcare ecosystem. Findings The paper proposes an original interpretative framework for knowledge transfer to support open innovation in healthcare ecosystems, composed of four main components: healthcare ecosystem's players' categories; knowledge flows among different categories of players along the exploration and exploitation stages of innovation development; players' motivations for open innovation; and players' positions in the innovation process. In addition, assuming the intermediary network as the suitable organizational model for healthcare ecosystem, four classification scenarios are identified on the basis of the main players' influence degree and motivations for open innovation.";3;Business;Ref197;Q1;2019
The importance of the healthcare industry has increased and it has thrived, although the cosmetic industry of Korea has been in depression. A recently issued group of items in Korea, cosmeceuticals', is defined as a combination of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics proven to have medical effectiveness. Antiaging cosmeceuticals in Korea have performed well in terms of expanding business by combining with beauty services, so they are viewed as high-valued items. This fact supports the evidence that there are various studies on cosmeceuticals. Therefore, this paper shows that the global status and growth potential of cosmeceuticals are documented and the concepts of the application of the demonstration complex and open innovation will be linked together based on research of antiaging cosmeceuticals in Korea for an aging society. This paper intends to provide the basic information for forming a lab to market' which connects the future cosmeceutical laboratory to the market.;18;Computer;Ref198;Q2;2019
This paper proposes a method to identify business diversification opportunities for a company. In particular, the method uses M&A cases related to business diversifications to identify atypical diversification opportunities. The underlying idea of the method is that industrial sectors of companies acquired by acquiring companies having similar characteristics with the focal company can be business diversification directions for the company. Industrial sectors of companies are identified by using WC(Intemational Patent Classification)-ISIC(International Standard Industrial Classification) concordance, and we updated the previous concordance to reflect the recent technological and business environments. For verification of the method, we used a successful M&A case related to business diversification and tested that the method can identify same industrial sector with the case as top priority. The results show that the method identified the same industrial sector as top ranking and other uncommon industrial sectors as recommended opportunities.;3;Business;Ref199;Q1;2019
This paper analyzes the drivers of multinational affiliates' innovation, using a dataset based on the Community Innovation Survey for Belgium. Specifically, we investigate the role of external knowledge sources on foreign affiliates' research efforts and innovation. We thereby develop an enriched typology by taking both the MNC and the host country perspective into consideration and distinguish between different types of subsidiaries, in order to disentangle differences in the use of knowledge sources between technology exploiting, seeking and creating subsidiaries. Our findings show that technology-creating foreign affiliates are able to tap into a combination of industry-based value chain partners and science-based partners. In particular, a combination of clients and universities have a powerful impetus on the research effort of technology creating firms. Our results also indicate that technology-seeking subsidiaries make more use of collaboration with competitors. Technology exploiting subsidiaries make significantly less use of external knowledge sources and have a lower R&D intensity.;3;Business;Ref200;Q1;2019
Public sector organisations increasingly innovate through open innovation practices that originated in the private sector. To explain the use of these innovation practices, extant research has focused on enabling conditions at the individual and organisational level, but has paid little attention to extra-organisational factors such as culture. To address this gap, we adopted a field framing perspective to study the use of open innovation practices in the New York City (NYC) administration. We found that actors in NYC equipped different social positions - insider, outsider and interstitial - and used different discursive tactics - reflective frame blending and supplemental frame blending - to enhance the cultural resonance of open innovation practices. We further theorise these findings with a framework on the enabling conditions for the cultural resonance of innovation practices. Our study contributes to innovation studies by unpacking the role of culture for the use of innovation practices and to the framing literature by specifying the role of discursive tactics and social positions for the cultural resonance of new practices.;3;Business;Ref201;Q1;2019
This study explores the innovation intermediaries' landscape in sub-Saharan Africa, considering Science Granting Councils (SGCs) as the key intermediaries in the system. Based on extensive desk research, personal interviews, and an online survey, the study discusses the roles and functions performed by SGCs as intermediators and influences of science, technology, and innovation (STI) policy. The results of the analysis corroborate the need for institutional and systemic changes to enable SGCs to perform their role. The realities, resources, and constraints at the local level cry out for the adaptation of current and future partnerships to the local context. The study concludes that only by tailoring partnerships to the development of capacity at the local level can SGCs perform effectively as influencers of national STI policy and mediators of partnerships with foreign development actors.;18;Computer;Ref202;Q2;2019
A vast amount of studies have shown how firms embracing the open innovation paradigm tend to improve their industrial and economic performance. Somewhat surprisingly, in such established background, few studies attempted to understand whether the open innovation benefits compensate its costs. To fill this gap, this article presents a novel theoretical framework composed of twelve propositions describing the main benefits and costs of inbound and outbound open innovation modes. Such theoretical framework was tested on a sample of 96 small and medium manufacturing enterprises. While most of the identified cost and benefit classes are acknowledged by the majority of the interviewed firms, most interviewees affirmed that their firms did not suffer from costs associated with the not-invented-here syndrome and with the potential loss of competitive advantage. The results of the study have implications for both firms and scholars, which are expected to lead to future researches.;3;Business;Ref203;Q2;2019
In this study, we extend recent attempts to clarify the role of antecedents of absorptive capacity in realising purposive inflows of external knowledge in the biopharmaceutical industry. By assuming that internal R&D resources contribute to absorptive capacity as a multidimensional concept, we propose a framework for the integrated analysis of the interactions between the different antecedents of absorptive capacity and inbound open innovation of biopharmaceutical firms. Our analysis relies on a set-theoretic approach and uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to study a set of selected Italian biopharmaceutical firms. The analysis reveals that biopharmaceutical companies with a diversified R&D business domain and an extended entrepreneurial scientific network are likely to adopt an inbound open innovation strategy.;3;Business;Ref204;Q2;2019
Knowledge transfer efficiency is an important indicator to evaluate the performance of open innovation (OI). However, there are few researches on the measurement of knowledge transfer efficiency in the context of OI networks. To make up this gap, this study explores the measurement of knowledge transfer efficiency based on the weighted OI network. Firstly, this paper builds the weighted OI network model with node and edge weights. On the basis of the weighted OI network model, the weighted path length and clustering coefficient are introduced and analysed. Moreover, the efficiency of knowledge transfer is further proposed as the main measure of knowledge transfer efficiency by comprehensively embodying the above factors, and then an extended application of the proposed main measure is developed to identify and locate the important members with great impact on knowledge transfer. Finally, a real case of several OI networks is provided to illustrate the applicability of the weighted OI network model and the knowledge transfer efficiency measurement method.;8;Engineering;Ref205;Q1;2019
"The implementation of open innovation models for R&D activities has been extensively tested by many public and private institutions by using several models; however, both lessons learned and rationale for internal decision-making have not been systematically analyzed to serve as a basis for future institutional process management improvements, which increase the success rate. The large diversity of cases, firms, sectors and open activities, and the multiple factors affecting success has made it difficult to elaborate a general framework where to extract from some policy design rules adapted to specific contexts; thus, involved firms do not have a consolidated framework to measure the effectiveness of the open innovation practices in use. Open innovation for R&D activities conducted by multinational firms is usually carried out at the international level looking for specific knowledge and complementarity of partners. One of the critical factors for success in open innovation activities is the ""right selection of adequate partners''. This paper postulates that the multi-variable selection based on the previous characterization of the relationship between the firm and one potential international partner constitutes a key factor for success. In addition, the article presents a semi-quantitative approach to measure the ""differences'' (a metrics based on ""proximity'' is defined) to analyze and compare between different partners from several dimensions. The key goal is to select external partners with the ""minimum distance'' to the firm. The proposed selection metrics were applied to various open research projects launched with university partners in the three Latin American countries (Mexico, Chile, and Peru).";5;Computer;Ref206;Q1;2019
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyze the relationship between knowledge management capabilities and successful open innovation within agri-food businesses. This particular piece of research focuses on agri-food businesses which utilize crowdfunding platforms. Design/methodology/approach The research adopts a survey-based methodology, which is useful in enhancing the generalization of results. The final sample includes 80 cases for the analysis. The model and the hypotheses were tested through a hierarchical regression model. Findings This research assesses the importance of knowledge management capabilities for successful open innovation in crowdfunding for agri-food businesses. In particular, it emerged that IT-based knowledge exploitation capabilities are enablers of open innovation strategies. Additionally, it emerged that knowledge exploration capabilities can positively mediate the relationship between IT-based knowledge exploitation capabilities and open innovation in the context of agri-food businesses. Originality/value To the authors' best knowledge, few researchers have explored this topic and, as such, there is a need to better conceptualize this intriguing phenomenon and to provide empirical evidence to support it.;1;Agriculture;Ref207;Q1;2019
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the way companies involved in Open Innovation Processes (OIPs) routinize the procedure through which they can absorb in-bound knowledge, i.e. knowledge that comes from the outside and, in particular, from the crowd. In-bound knowledge passes through the phases of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation. Thus, companies need to define mechanisms and paths - related to their potential and realized absorptive capacity -to manage and exploit it. Design/methodology/approach The present paper is based on a longitudinal case study, an OIP launched by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) that has already been implemented for three times. Multiple direct interviews with FCA top managers have allowed rebuilding the routinized procedure through which the company absorbs in-bound knowledge. Findings To routinize the procedure of absorbing in-bound knowledge, the company has settled specific mechanisms and paths and has established some bottlenecks over the process of acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation of in-bound knowledge. These mechanisms and path, as well as these bottlenecks, are identified and descripted in the paper. Research limitations/implications Beyond the limitations linked to the use of a single case study, another limitation might be the reference to a big company in a specific industry. Anyway, with due caution, achieved findings can be referred to other industries as well. Originality/value This paper contributes to exploring if and how companies managing OIPs routinize the procedure through which they can absorb in-bound knowledge.;13;Information;Ref208;Q1;2019
"Enabling individuals to perform open innovation practices requires an in-depth analysis of the context in which those practices are enacted. However, research on the context within which open innovation is practiced, is still in its beginning. This paper develops a theoretical framework of the relationship between open innovation practices, individuals performing those practices, and context factors that enable or constrain those individuals carrying out open innovation practices. Moreover, the paper reports empirical research on context factors enabling or constraining salespeople in performing customer knowledge absorption practices, a specific subset of open innovation practices, in a pharmaceutical packaging machines firm. The paper contributes to open innovation research by: 1) advancing a contextual view on open innovation; 2) emphasising the need to distinguish between open innovation practices that provide an analytical tool to unravel the social dimension of open innovation; 3) identifying context factors that enable or constrain customer knowledge absorption.";8;Engineering;Ref209;Q1;2019
"Open innovation is an essential phenomenon in the crowdfunding context. This conceptual piece tends to offer an integrative discussion of three important mechanisms upon which stakeholders of a crowdfunding platform conduct open innovation and value co-creation in crowdfunding sites. These mechanisms include: diversity, knowing, and networking. We argued that: 1. diverse demographic attributes facilitate multiple-party value co-creation; 2. knowledge of platform stakeholders improves quality of ideas; 3. networking positively impacts on open innovation performance. With such discussions, a theoretical foundation for future research is built and more research issues are stimulated.";18;Computer;Ref210;Q2;2019
Open innovation implies that geographical proximity is irrelevant. However, we posit that any potential innovation outcome depends on the spatial constraints on openness. In this paper, we add a geographical proximity dimension to open innovation by analysing how a domestic and international open innovation approach affects innovation outcomes. In particular, we hypothesise that domestic open innovation has positive effects on new-to-the-firm product innovation, due to easily accessible resources. We further posit that, through international open innovation, SMEs can access new and advanced knowledge which is not available locally, leading to more novel innovations. However, we expect that the relationship between openness, both domestic and international, and innovation is conditional on R&D activities. Our empirical analysis based on the Cyprus Community Innovation Survey supports these hypotheses. Our results underline the critical role of the spatial aspect on open innovation in SMEs, something which has remained surprisingly absent from the literature.;3;Business;Ref211;Q1;2019
In search of fresh ideas, firms increasingly engage with external contributors in open innovation collaborations. However, research has found that such collaborations frequently fail, and has pointed to conflicting demands of control and openness. On the one hand, firms want controlled and selective participation, clarity of purpose, and a choice of ideas based on their own current capacity and value appropriation strategies. On the other, their external contributors tend to want open and unfettered participation, the creative potential of the idea per se, and unrestricted knowledge sharing. This article proposes to shift the conceptual frame from looking at the tensions between control and openness as problems to looking at them as synergies. Drawing on the literature of open innovation and organizational paradox, this article contributes a novel perspective on open innovation that suggests how firms can leverage open innovation collaborations through paradox by combining practices based on differentiation and integration.;3;Business;Ref212;Q1;2019
"The aim of this paper is twofold: firstly, investigate the theory of governance and open innovation by adding the process of value creation and value capture; secondly, to discuss the potential link between open innovation and economic sustainability. With the current emphasis of the literature being on either the value creation or value capture processes, the phenomenon of open innovation is only partially understood. To help broaden this understanding, we conducted an in-depth case study of the processes behind the transformation of governance structures at Iran Khodro Company (IKCO), which led to the emergence of both value creation and capture processes. A multi project analysis (from 1994 to 2012) has point out that IKCO have created and developed a formal value creation and capture processes from the part level through to the architectural level, allowing a gradual openness at those levels and at the same time ensuring a greater economic sustainability of the IKCO business. These findings reveal the existence of four unique levels of open innovation in product development architecture. Practical implications are also provided relating the impact that each of these levels can have on the economic sustainable model of the firms in the manufacturing sector.";18;Computer;Ref213;Q2;2018
In the age of knowledge-based economies, open innovation has increasing importance. This study aimed to explore the architectural design approaches that can revitalize innovation activities in the era of knowledge-based economies. This paper investigated global case research campuses, manufacturing systems, and innovation districts where architectural design supports innovation activities. This study developed a research framework of architectural design for innovation and applied it in the selected case studies to generate insights. First, the research campuses selected as case studies included Panopticon, DGIST Education and Research Campuses, and Apple Park. Second, the open innovation of manufacturing system architecture was analyzed through the case studies of the Ford Motor Company, Toyota Motor Corporation, and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. Third, this paper studied the clustered open innovation architectures of Macquarie Park, One North, and Strijp-S Innovation Districts. The findings revealed how tacit knowledge motivates open innovation through the design of manufacturing systems, research campuses, and innovation districts through real examples and mathematical or concept model building.;18;Computer;Ref214;Q2;2018
Supply chain disintegration is considered, due to its importance as an enabler for the management of technology innovation. This research is urgent as it is relevant to a wide range of other occurrences outside of technology innovation management, including: major policy or regulatory changes, industrial actions, economic sanctions, trade wars, trade realignment - such as Brexit, natural disasters, civil disorder and conflict, and financial crises. Disintegration is the re-alignment of partners and coordination within a supply chain to enhance customer value. This process is driven by one of more of the following: introduction of new technology or input, elimination of existing technology or input, change in customer requirements, and/or change in other external factors. The interdisciplinary nature and intellectual foundations of disintegration are considered. Finally, areas of research need are offered.;8;Engineering;Ref215;Q1;2018
This article is focused on public service innovation from an innovation management perspective. It presents research experience gained from a European project for managing social and technological innovation in the production and evaluation of citizen-centred intemet-enabled services in the public sector. It is based on six urban pilot initiatives, which sought to operationalise a new approach to co-producing and co-evaluating civic services in smart cities commonly referred to as open innovation for smart city services. Research suggests that the evidence base underpinning this approach is not sufficiently robust to support claims being made about its effectiveness. Instead evaluation research of citizen-centred internet-enabled urban services is in its infancy and there are no tested methods or tools in the literature for supporting this approach. The paper reports on the development and trialing of a novel Co-evaluation Framework, indicators and reporting categories, used to support the co-production of smart city services in an EU-funded project. Our point of departure is that innovation of services is a sub-set of innovation management that requires effective integration of technological with social innovation, supported by the right skills and capacities. The main skills sets needed for effective co-evaluation of open innovation services are the integration of stakeholder management with evaluation capacities.;8;Engineering;Ref216;Q1;2018
National economies are often strengthened by diversification, which is built in turn on a healthy and productive culture of national innovation. Innovation is a complex process, which is difficult to measure in an objective manner. In this work and for the first time, a quantitative measure for open innovation has been developed and validated to determine the performance of a firm within the marine biotechnology sector in Oman. This breakthrough was achieved in four steps. First, the characteristics of the two dimensions of open innovation (`breadth' and 'depth') were identified using a critical review of the literature and a series of pre-tests of a survey design with industrial experts. Second, a quantitative index for open innovation by measuring these two dimensions at firm level was developed. Third, validation of this five-item scale was conducted using the UK Community Innovation Survey (CIS) data set. Fourth, the five-item scale was applied to 22 firms in the marine bio-industry sector in Oman using a case study approach, and was used to rank the firms according to their open innovation index. This analysis shows how Omani marine bio-industry firms could strengthen their open innovation efforts, for example by collaborating more effectively with government organizations and research institutes to thereby boost the quality of their open innovation activities in a measurable way.;9;Environmental;Ref217;Q1;2018
"Using a longitudinal in-depth field study at NASA, I investigate how the open, or peer-production, innovation model affects R&D professionals, their work, and the locus of innovation. R&D professionals are known for keeping their knowledge work within clearly defined boundaries, protecting it from individuals outside those boundaries, and rejecting meritorious innovation that is created outside disciplinary boundaries. The open innovation model challenges these boundaries and opens the knowledge work to be conducted by anyone who chooses to contribute. At NASA, the open model led to a scientific breakthrough at unprecedented speed using unusually limited resources; yet it challenged not only the knowledge-work boundaries but also the professional identity of the R&D professionals. This led to divergent reactions from R&D professionals, as adopting the open model required them to go through a multifaceted transformation. Only R&D professionals who underwent identity refocusing work dismantled their boundaries, truly adopting the knowledge from outside and sharing their internal knowledge. Others who did not go through that identity work failed to incorporate the solutions the open model produced. Adopting open innovation without a change in R&D professionals' identity resulted in no real change in the R&D process. This paper reveals how such processes unfold and illustrates the critical role of professional identity work in changing knowledge-work boundaries and shifting the locus of innovation.";3;Business;Ref218;Q1;2018
The formation of new ventures is among the most significant sources of technological innovation and fast economic development. Nonetheless, most attempts at starting new businesses will be unsuccessful. This study seeks to predict new venture success ('Take-off') based on different factors observed in the pre-startup phase. We apply the resource-based view of the firm (RBV) to develop a framework synthesizing the entrepreneurship and Open Innovation (OI) literatures on new venture creation. We then assess the influence of three categories of internal resources (finance, technology, human capital) and introduce the concept of teams' 'openness' in the founding process as a crucial organizational capital resource shaping startup success. Drawing on a sample of 134 business plans submitted to the final round of the INTEL Global Challenge at UC Berkeley, we significantly associate 'Take-off' to each category of resources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to emphasize the relevance of teams' ability to combine and transform their initial resources through the pursuit of OI (i.e., the elaboration of organizational capital resources) in explaining startup success. Our analysis extends RBV-based research on nascent entrepreneurship and suggests new fields of research into OI.;3;Business;Ref219;Q1;2018
"While open innovation provides a new paradigm to sustain a firm's competitive advantage, opening up to external knowledge also entails substantial risks of appropriation and opportunism. Building on this ""open paradox"" framework, this study investigates whether societal trust-a key aspect of informal cultural norms-serves as an effective mechanism in improving relational governance among partners, thereby leading to better collaborative outcomes. Using a novel panel data on co-owned patents across 29 countries, we show that firms in high trust countries are able to produce a higher level of joint output (i.e., co-owned patents). This effect is more pronounced when perceived opportunism is higher (i.e., firms in high-tech industries, or in countries with less disclosure transparency), and when formal contracts are less enforceable (i.e., in countries with relatively weak legal systems). We further show that open innovation is the channel through which societal trust promotes innovative efficiency. Overall, our study establishes societal trust as a key factor in influencing the efficiency of open innovation.";3;Business;Ref220;Q1;2018
Open innovation has attracted a significant amount of attention from scholars and practitioners. Prior research on open innovation has mainly focused on collaborative inventing. However, understanding the processes and outcomes of joint inventing is not sufficient for understanding sustained open-innovation activities and the competitive advantages of the actors involved in open innovation. Instead, an understanding of value creation and value capture is paramount for advancing our understanding of sustained open-innovation activities. Open innovation requires collaboration among distributed but interdependent actors who rely on each other's capabilities for value creation and capture. Value in open innovation is driven not only by actors' value creation but also by their ability to capture value. While value creation and value capture are discussed in the open-innovation literature, the advancement of this stream of research is hindered by conceptual ambiguity, especially in relation to the concept of value capture. This article adopts a value perspective on open innovation, offers consistent conceptualizations of value creation and value capture, and outlines potential avenues for further research at the interface of open innovation, value creation, and value capture.;3;Business;Ref221;Q1;2018
Environmental problems caused by human behaviors have become increasingly serious in recent decades, thereby driving global green governance issue to become an important research agenda. The proper governance structure design and governance mechanism arrangement can effectively coordinate the relationship between human and nature. Literatures have provided mixed evidence of harmonious development of economy, society and environment. However, few studies have examined the balance of interests between human appeal and natural environment from the perspective of governance. Open innovation activities can effectively deal with the externalities of resources and environment and then relatively balance the economic value and green value of organizations, which is an effective green governance mode, reflecting the characteristics of the main subject composition and mechanism operation of green governance. This paper attempts to build a green governance framework for the cooperation based on sustainable development among enterprises, governments, social organizations, the public and the nature. This paper examines the synergy between human and nature by presenting a framework, including related theories of green governance, innovation subjects, innovation mechanisms and innovation mode. Each country and region could use the suggested framework to develop green governance guidelines that are suitable for the environmental carrying capacity of their own countries or regions. Enterprises could use the suggested framework to develop green development strategies to coordinate the economic values and green values.;18;Computer;Ref222;Q2;2018
New disruptive technologies in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), especially, are changing the manner in which knowledge is managed within organizations, calling for a new and inventive knowledge management system and an open approach, to foster knowledge flows. This pattern expectedly should also enhance the development of internal knowledge management capacity, which in turn is a prerequisite of firm's innovativeness. In this context, the main goal of this research is to investigate the relationship among knowledge management system, open innovation, knowledge management capacity and innovation capacity. To reach this goal, the research employs structural equation modelling on a sample of 298 Italian firms from different sectors. The findings indicate that knowledge management system facilitates the creation of open and collaborative ecosystems, and the exploitation of internal and external flows of knowledge, through the development of internal knowledge management capacity, which in turn increases innovation capacity. The research further draws on its findings to identify significant scholarly and managerial implications, and to prescribe future research directions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this article is to present findings on knowledge management (KM) and knowledge creation, as well as open innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Iceland. Two SME company case studies are presented in the form of a case study involving semistructured interviews with managers and selected employees and in-field observation. Company Alpha is a software company, whereas Company Beta is a family company which produces drinks and snacks. Knowledge creation and innovation is a learning process in both companies. The two companies show very different open-innovation models in practice. The findings regarding the two companies are in accordance with the arguments of Chiaroni et al., where they state that high-tech companies tend to prefer inside-out strategies of open innovation, whereas low-tech companies prefer outside-in strategies. Company Alpha relates to customers late in the process, whereas Company Beta relies on knowledge from customers and suppliers and for new knowledge early on in the process.;19;Social;Ref224;Q2;2018
Cities of the future have to be 'smart'. In this regard, the open innovation model seems to provide efficient support for the involvement of private firms in public collaborations, by ensuring that there is efficiency and affordability in the delivery of new and 'smart' city services. This inquiry aims to fill a gap in the main field of research: only a very few studies have tried to analyse the challenges encountered, and the strategies followed, by firms developing open innovation strategies with public partners in Smart City Projects (SCPs). In trying to fill this gap, exploratory and qualitative analysis was performed on the decision-making processes of multinational companies participating in SCPs. This study uses a multiple-case research method, based on 21 in-depth semi-structured interviews with the smart city managers of seven large multinational companies. With reference to and in line with these cases, interesting predictions emerge relating to public-private collaborations and the creation of different forms of explorative and exploitative project alliances in cities. In particular, companies that develop alliances with public partners consider the open innovation model to be a testbed for future technologies and the development of products and services, by supporting positive knowledge spill-oven that reduce the technological gap between the private and the public sector and-at the same time-stimulating the development of a smart city ecosystem when firms are looking for the cross-fertilization of ideas. The research sheds light on public-private partnerships and the open innovation approach in a new and complex context, that of the smart city, reframing managerial debates concerning innovation-driven collaborations between the private and the public sector.;3;Business;Ref225;Q1;2018
In open innovation initiatives for sustainability-oriented innovations, it is indispensable to have a wide array of engaging stakeholders. Yet, as not all relevant actors are able or willing to participate, important opinions can go unnoticed. Due to such stakeholder selection effects, aspects of high relevance may remain uncaptured. To address this issue, we first define the concept of silent stakeholders and relate it to sustainability-oriented innovations. We then discuss the new approach of employing analytical methods to examine existing sources outside the innovation process for silent stakeholder opinions. For this purpose, we conduct an action research study demonstrating how to examine broad discourse data with text analytics for an open innovation project aiming to create a sustainability-oriented innovation. To this end, we develop an approach for the efficient integration of external sources in open innovation processes. We find that text analytics of broad discourse data can particularly support the orientation and idea generation phase for sustainability-oriented innovation. Furthermore, we identify possibilities for the application of further data mining methods to complement open innovation approaches along the innovation process. Building on that, we propose an integrated framework. Hence, we add to the literature on stakeholder participation, analytical methods and innovation management, as well as sustainability-oriented innovation.;18;Computer;Ref226;Q2;2018
Recently, selecting the matching mode of cooperation with right partners to efficiently create a technical innovation and minimize risks and costs of innovation has become a primary choice for modern enterprise. This paper mainly studied the behaviour of corporate decision-making on cooperation modes of open innovation from the perspective of endogenous knowledge spillovers, by the use of literatures reviewing, evolutionary game and simulation methods. This research has shown that different initial scales of enterprises choosing specific modes had no effect on the result of evolution. Endogenous knowledge spillovers had a positive effect on expected innovation return of technologysharing alliance, which caused that the increasing of endogenous knowledge spillovers would make enterprises prefer technology-sharing alliance, but the promotion in innovation payoffs by endogenous knowledge spillovers is limited. These results can provide theory references for corporate technological innovation, cooperation deepening and government policy-making.;21;Telecommunications;Ref227;Q3;2018
Supplier management is critical for supply chain management (SCM). The aim of supplier selection is to find an order of preference among potential suppliers. However, the ranking results for supplier selection may not be important, particularly when the performances are conflicting or have minor differences. Different criteria may have different impacts on the ranking results, and different decision makers may place different priorities on multiple criteria. Relatively worse suppliers may still have to be used for many practical reasons. One alternative is supplier development, but it has been focused on categorizing individual suppliers for possible action plans. A new framework is proposed in this research to address supplier selection and supplier development at the same time in the publishing and printing industries. First, the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (fuzzy AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) are sequentially performed to rank and select the best supplier(s) of a publishing company. In addition to ranking suppliers, a managerial analysis is proposed to assess the impact of important criteria on supplier selection in more detail. Finally, the results of the DEA are provided for direct supplier development without supplier categorization. This research shows that the proposed framework effectively addresses supplier development as well as supplier selection in the publishing and printing industries.;18;Computer;Ref228;Q2;2018
Organizations need innovation to be competitive and sustainable on their marketplace. Sustainable performance is an important precondition for growth and development. In spite of a body of literature, non-financial factors of sustainable performance remain an open issue. Coaching has gained considerable attention in the business world for its impact on sustainable performance. The current research investigates the use of coaching interaction to facilitate organizational sustainable growth and development in the context of Miller and Friesen's five stage life-cycle model. The expert opinion survey is chosen as a central method of research. The questionnaire is developed on the literature review that is focused on the drivers for sustainable development throughout the life cycle, and the features of coaching that accelerate these driving forces. Fifteen experts took part in the survey conducted from November 2017 to January 2018. The results are estimated by considering the competence coefficient for each expert. The findings led to creation of an open innovation model, which displays relationships between the appropriate coaching forms and types and the organizational life cycle stages. The developed model enables choosing the optimal way of coaching delivery at any life cycle stage. This model is particularly valuable for the coaching support programs.;18;Computer;Ref229;Q2;2018
Prior research on open innovation provides no systematic insight whether firms with internal innovation constraints increase the scale of R&D outsourcing or the number of innovation cooperation partnerships. Motivated by this research gap in the literature, we study the effect of economic- and knowledge-related innovation impediments on a degree of formal openness in innovation. Analyzing a 3 years panel dataset of German manufacturing firms obtained from Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP) database, we find that knowledge-related obstacles induce firms to increase the scale of R&D outsourcing as well as to engage in innovation cooperation partnerships. Contrariwise, a non-significant relationship is detected between economic related innovation impediments and R&D openness. Hence, the study suggests that a high degree of openness in innovation is driven by knowledge shortages rather than cost-risk minimization objectives.;3;Business;Ref230;Q1;2018
Research SummaryIn recent decades, two emergent phenomena have jointly transformed the nature and pursuit of entrepreneurship across industries and sectors: open innovation and platformization. Open innovation involves a shift toward more open and distributed models of innovation, while platformization refers to the increasing importance of digital platforms as a venue for value creation and capture. Together, open innovation and platforms have created numerous opportunities for entrepreneurs and their firmsfrom serving as inputs for innovation for established firms to participating as complementors on existing platforms. While these entrepreneurial opportunities (and conditions) have manifested themselves in rich and varied ways, our understanding of these new forms of entrepreneurship has lagged behind. In this essay, and in this special issue, our objective is to bring a sharper focus on the important research issues and questions that frame open innovation, platforms, and entrepreneurship. Managerial SummaryDigital platforms and open innovation environments have unleashed numerous promising opportunities for entrepreneurs, in industries ranging from consumer software, entertainment, and home appliances to auto, health, and energy. To pursue those opportunities, however, entrepreneurs will need to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that facilitate and constrain them. In this essay, we identify and discuss several of these factors and the associated challenges and highlight the need for additional research. We also consider some of the broader contextual factors, including regulatory policies, digitization, and globalization that shape the emerging opportunities.;3;Business;Ref231;Q1;2018
Research SummaryCompanies sponsor platform ecosystems as an open innovation strategy to encourage complementors to develop complementary products, services, or technologies that can add value to the platform ecosystem. In this study, we develop and test an information-based theory of entrepreneurial activity within platform ecosystems. We postulate that ecosystems produce different types of informationa subset of which will foster entrepreneurship in the form of the commercialization of complementary products that were previously released for free. Our results indicate that product-specific information is associated with commercialization, but we fail to detect a relationship between market information and subsequent commercialization activity. Managerial SummaryThe digital economy has led to a proliferation of platform ecosystems that harness external innovation. These ecosystems rely on complementors who enhance the value of platforms by creating complementary technologies. Hence, complementors' commercial viability is important. One such type of ecosystem is an app store, which enables complementors to introduce software that improves the platform product. App stores exist for a variety of software platforms, ranging from mobile phone operating systems (iOS and Android) to electronic medical record systems (Epic and Cerner). In this research, we find that complementors who introduce a free version of a mobile app are more likely to commercialize their app in response to specific types of information and platform designers should manage information in their platforms to foster platform viability.;3;Business;Ref232;Q1;2018
This paper aims to contribute to the debate on Open Innovation in the age of Big Data by shedding new light on the role that social networks can play as enabling platforms for tourists' involvement and sources for the creation and management of valuable knowledge assets. The huge amount of data generated on social media by tourists related to their travel experiences can be a valid source of open innovation. To achieve this aim, this paper presents evidence of a digital tourism experience, through a longitudinal case study of a destination in Apulia, a Southern European region. The findings of the study demonstrate how social Big Data could open up innovation processes that could be of support in defining sustainable tourism experiences in a destination.;18;Computer;Ref233;Q2;2018
The extant literature runs short in understanding openness of innovation regarding and the different pathways along which internal and external knowledge resources can be combined. This study proposes a unique typology for outside-in innovations based on two distinct ways of boundary spanning: whether an innovation idea is created internally or externally and whether an innovation process relies on external knowledge resources. This yields four possible types of innovation, which represent the nuanced variation of outside-in innovations. Using historical data from Canada for 1945-1980, this study unveils different implications of these innovation types for different levels of innovation novelty. Copyright (C) 2016 ASAC.

Research SummaryOpen innovation is about firms harnessing knowledge flows across firm boundaries, but limited research has examined the nature and antecedents of these flows for start-up firms, as well as the interdependence of inbound and outbound flows. From a new sample of start-up firms making 3D printers, we show how their degree of openness for inbound and outbound knowledge flows relates to the firms' initial capabilities and founding intentions. From this, we suggest that the patterns of openness are influenced more by initial factor endowments than a firm-specific process of emergent strategy development. Managerial SummaryInnovative firms often face trade-offs between open and proprietary strategies, particularly in industries and segments where online communities and other collaborations provide a pool of shared knowledge for the entire industry. This study illuminates these trade-offs by comparing the choices made by the founders of 3D printer manufacturers. For products based on modular systems, it shows the range of choices that firms have on their degree of inbound openness (using external technology) and outbound openness (sharing their own technology)as well as the interdependencies of these choices. Finally, it points to long-term implications of early entrepreneurial decisions: firms that leverage external technology can enter markets more quickly, but their innovation options will be limited unless they have capabilities for proprietary innovation.;3;Business;Ref235;Q1;2018
Tacit knowledge is considered critical to the success of open innovation projects, yet little is known about the factors that promote or impede tacit knowledge sharing in such projects. This article uses exponential random graph modeling to examine both tacit and explicit knowledge sharing in two early-stage open innovation projects. Results indicate autonomous motivation predicts tacit knowledge sharing, suggesting that managers need to promote a team culture that satisfies members' needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The modeling also suggests that brokerage is important in the early stage of a project to build the strong informal social structures needed to facilitate the exchange of tacit knowledge.;3;Business;Ref236;Q1;2018
"Previous studies related to open innovation have presented piecewise implications in relation to various knowledge management capacities. The study published by Lichtenthaler and Lichtenthaler in 2009 presented a model that combines the various open innovation capacities of firms in view of a mix of knowledge management, dynamic capability and absorptive capacity. Despite these efforts, there have been few empirical studies on the relationships among capacities, or between capacities and performance from an integrated perspective. Therefore, this study seeks to clarify the relationships among knowledge capacities and between knowledge capacities, technological innovation and financial performance at the firm level. Our findings are that the transformative, connective, inventive and absorptive capacities both directly and indirectly affects technological innovation performance; and innovative and desorptive capacities are the key factors connecting technological innovation to financial performance. This study provides managerial implications for the balanced development of the various knowledge capacities and the improvement of technological innovation and financial performance for firm knowledge managers.";18;Computer;Ref237;Q2;2018
Researchers have used several constructs to explain the success and failure of organizations' open innovation initiatives. Building upon the resource-based view of the firm, we develop a model to explain how leadership interacts with absorptive capacity and organizational learning culture to influence open innovation outcomes. The model is tested empirically using data sourced from managers working in diverse sectors in India. Results reveal that empowering leadership leads to enhanced open innovation outcomes through the intervention of organizational learning culture. Results, however, do not confirm a significant impact of the interaction of organizational culture and absorptive capacity on open innovation. A discussion of these findings along with implications for theory and practice is presented.;3;Business;Ref238;Q1;2018
Open innovation contests are a popular way to tap into the creativity of customers. Many firms host multiple, successive open innovation contests in response to different, creative challenges they face. To encourage customers to participate and make an effort in such contests, they offer monetary rewards of varying sizes. Although prior research has investigated the optimal reward design for one-time contests, little is known about how the rewards offered in a contest can influence individuals' ongoing level of participation and their creative effort in subsequent contests. Receiving a reward is a form of positive competence feedback that influences individuals' feelings of competence and intrinsic motivation. Based on cognitive evaluation theory, we argue that these feelings can persist after a contest ends, influencing positively participation and creative efforts in later contests. Our online experiment and also our analysis of the data from an actual open innovation platform show that individuals tend to cease participating in subsequent contests, significantly reducing the size of the crowd over time. Receiving a reward and positive competence feedback alleviates this tendency. Therefore, offering more prizes motivates more high-performing individuals to participate again and to put in more creative effort, which in turn raise the average quality as well as the best quality in subsequent contests. These findings suggest that in successive open innovation contests, multiple rewards not only encourage greater participation, but also promote better quality outcomes. Thus, firms are well advised to expand the positive reward feedback in contests, as doing so will help them to maintain a sizable and motivated crowd of contestants.;3;Business;Ref239;Q1;2018
Small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in the healthcare IT industry must have innovative technology and, at the same time, be able to commercialize this technology in order to have sustainable growth, as enterprises in any other industry do. However, due to the lack of resources of SMEs, many studies focus on effective and innovative strategies based on a resource-based view. To be more effective, some SMEs collaborate with other companies in the manufacturing process, not as a closed, but rather as an open innovation. However, this collaboration is difficult and bears risks. Additionally, as an external factor, the government certification system attempts to help SMEs. Therefore, in this study, we performed a multiple regression analysis centered on firms' resources and strategies. Three results were obtained. First, in terms of the firms' resources, the higher the quality of patents that measure firm capacity, the higher the firm performance. Second, regarding the firms' strategies, cooperation with external companies in the manufacturing process has a positive effect on firm performance. Third, receiving government certification (InnoBiz certification), as a form of cooperation with the government, has a negative impact on firm performance. In other words, the present government policy to support the R&D of SMEs needs to be adjusted. SMEs can develop high-quality patents, and strategies for cooperation with external companies can enhance the innovation performance of enterprises.;18;Computer;Ref240;Q2;2018
Openness has increasingly become a trend in innovation management. This study aims to propose a contingent conceptual framework for open innovation that reflects the evolution of this concept based on the academic literature. Besides, it aims to analyze how open innovation can affect firm and innovation performance. Additionally, it identifies the key contingent variables that affect the relationship between open innovation and performance. To accomplish these objectives, the research design is a systematic literature review, merging bibliometrics, content analysis and mind maps. The bibliometrics was applied to investigate the key references and topics. For the content analysis, a detail-coding schema was developed. Then, a mind map approach was applied towards a contingent conceptual model. Finally, a methodological triangulation was applied for understanding in-depth the insights of these research methods applied. As a result, a contingent conceptual model of open innovation has been developed. In this model, the open innovation construct is an independent variable classified as inbound or outbound, and the dependent variables are firm performance and innovation performance. Moreover, contingent variables (control and moderator) were identified, highlighting the moderate effect of knowledge flow. Finally, open innovation antecedents and enablers were identified.;3;Business;Ref241;Q1;2018
"With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the Korean industrial environment has been rapidly changing. As a result, several industries are facing different innovation conditions, including: the automotive industry, which is a traditional manufacturing industry in Korea; the aerospace industry, which has been vertically integrated, and has been led by a single large company-Korea Aerospace Industries-since Korea went through an economic crisis in the 1990s; and the robotics industry, which is currently emerging. This study used parameters related to patents originating from the automobile, robotics, and aerospace fields. The patents subjected to analysis were those registered in Korea from 2001 to 2014, and included those that were applied for, jointly applied for, or registered by Korean companies. This study analyzed the differences caused by the effect of open innovation in the three industries. According to our results, first, the three industries experienced different effects of open innovation. Second, when large companies controlled a given industry, open innovation either worked a little or did not work at all. According to this research result, the Korean robotics industry, which has a weak dominance of large companies, experienced a strong effect of open innovation, in that joint patent applications led to economic gains from the patents and an increase in technology transfer and technology value. The aerospace industry of Korea, which has the highest dominance of large companies, experienced a slight effect of open innovation, as the effect of joint patent application only improved the technology value. Finally, the automotive industry of Korea had an intermediate level of open innovation, between the aerospace and robotics sectors.";18;Computer;Ref242;Q2;2018
Advancements in information technology (IT) have made organizational boundaries so porous, thereby resulting in a trend toward leveraging external knowledge for innovation. However, firms experience significant obstacles in drawing external knowledge. This study aims to disentangle the role of IT-enabled absorptive capacity in new product development performance. The research model was tested with survey data of open innovation projects from 152 firms. Our findings indicate that IT-enabled absorptive capability improves open innovation project performance in terms of new product innovativeness and product speed to market, but we do not detect a significant direct influence of openness on performance. Our findings also show that the interaction of IT-enabled absorptive capacity and ideation openness significantly amplifies new product innovativeness while the interaction of IT-enabled absorptive capacity and implementation openness accelerates the product speed to market. This study theoretically contributes by building an IT-enabled absorptive capacity theory in the open innovation context and uncovering the effects of two dimensions of openness. In practice, it offers managers strategies to successfully conduct open innovation projects in deploying effective ITs and leveraging various types of openness during the two phases.;5;Computer;Ref243;Q1;2018
This paper discusses the links between knowledge-oriented leadership, open innovation and knowledge management in the international business context. Open innovation has become crucial for an increasing number of multinational enterprises (MNEs) to gain and maintain competitive advantage and become a market leader. Despite the recent proliferation of papers dealing with open innovation practices of MNEs, there is limited work investigating the role of knowledge management (KM) capability on the relationship between knowledge-oriented leadership and open innovation. Given MNEs' growing interest in open innovation, the lack of research on knowledge-oriented leadership and KM capability in the open innovation context is a significant research gap in our knowledge. In response, we conducted a study on the mediating role of KM capability in the linkage between knowledge-oriented leadership and open innovation (inbound and outbound), using data collected from 172 subsidiaries of MNEs based in France. A structural equation modelling approach is employed to study the impact of the latent variables associated with knowledge-oriented leadership and KM capability on open innovation. The results indicate that higher levels of knowledge-oriented leadership can lead to enhanced KM capability and improved open innovation outcomes. That is, knowledge-oriented leadership has a direct, positive impact on KM capability and open innovation. Also, KM capability is found to mediate the linkage between knowledge-oriented leadership and open innovation. This study provides useful insights for managers who wish to enhance open innovation activities in MNEs, and offers useful guidance to international business scholars, encouraging further research in this area.;3;Business;Ref244;Q1;2018
"Prior studies of open innovation have highlighted the effects of different flows of knowledge between firms and external partners such as flows of software code, technical solutions, or new product ideas-and how firms face a ""paradox of openness"" about how open to be to external sources while also appropriating value. There are increasingly flows of more provisional knowledge as well, in the form of product innovation rumors exchanged within online technology blogs. Our study objective was to understand how product innovation rumors are used by firms as both inflows and outflows of provisional knowledge and their effect on the innovation process. Using interview data within a high-technology firm whose forthcoming products were the subject of rumor within technology blogs, we develop propositions regarding how inflows of product innovation rumors affect innovation decisions (while addressing concerns about appropriability and intrafirm knowledge flows) and how outflows from firms may affect stakeholders outside the firm (through selective revealing and influence of technology blog editors). Product innovation rumors in part address the paradox of openness by forming an informal means of open innovation alongside formal processes, and we suggest further research opportunities in this domain.";3;Business;Ref245;Q1;2018
This work extends knowledge concerning the relationships among open innovation, innovative performance and government support for innovation within Brazilian firms. Data were obtained from two different firm samples (Sample A, on incremental innovation, and Sample B, on radical innovation). The main research results are as follows. First, in considering government support for innovation, Sample B, based on radical innovation, played a superior and stronger role than Sample A. Secondly, for both samples, the cooperation of external firms has a positive effect on firms' innovative performance, which was positively controlled by the size of the firms. Thirdly, in general, radical innovation requires synergy and a more intense focus regarding the constructs considered therein. This work also adds value in methodological terms, as this is the first research to have tested different models of samples with different levels of radicalism in innovation.;8;Engineering;Ref246;Q1;2018
In recent years, cultural sustainability has attracted increasing attention within the discourse of sustainable development and sustainable cities. Notwithstanding some effort put on conceptualizing the relationship between culture and sustainability, research on the issue is still in a pre-paradigmatic stage and related empirical studies are scant. In particular, further knowledge is required to understand not only how cultural sustainability has been addressed strategically but also implemented in practice. In this direction, research has pointed out the role of social structures (e.g., partnerships, collaborations, etc.) for achieving cultural sustainability goals. However, focusing on smart cities, attention is limited to how collaborative arrangements can be leveraged within the development of new city services (e.g., smart open innovation) to sustain goals of environmental, economic and social sustainability, with cultural sustainability still playing a marginal role. This paper develops a new framework linking together the strategic level and the practice level in addressing cultural sustainability and conceptualizing the role of collaborative structures in the development of smart innovation. The framework is then used as a frame of reference for analyzing the case of MuseoTorino, a new city museum realized within the smart city strategy of Turin (Italy). The analysis provides evidence of some practices adopted to leverage collaboration and stakeholders' engagement to strategically address cultural sustainability and to realize it in practice throughout the new service development process.;18;Computer;Ref247;Q2;2018
Although open innovation has gained more and more attention in innovation management, even for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), still lack heterogeneous explanations on how smaller firms do engage in open innovations and which source of knowledge they exploit most. In this context, this paper investigates if SMEs from different industries participate in open innovation, highlighting the role of internal and external sources at introducing new products and services. Our study shows that SMEs of Piedmont still have a closed approach to innovation and mainly rely on internal sources to develop new products and services. Moreover, with regard to external sources of knowledge, they primarily rely on one source, the customers.;3;Business;Ref248;Q2;2018
This paper deals with the broad concepts of innovation, inter-company relationship models, and regional knowledge systems as the focus of a scholarly enquiry into product development analysis. As research advances, it brings together the experience and theoretical interests of different social and economic environments. It is now necessary to identify an integrating framework that can clarify the state-of-the-art in the field and extend the boundaries of what is already a significant volume of literature. The authors have tried to describe the emerging phenomenon of close networks of cooperation at regional level that inspire and promote innovation. They are also concerned with the apparent paradox between, on the one side, the increasing openness of knowledge economies which seems to dissolve borders and, on the other, the new importance of place, particularly agglomerations. A useful background to the relevant issues is provided by helpful studies on the competitive advantages of spatial clustering, which minimizes distance-related transaction costs and maximizes flows of tacit knowledge and interactive learning effects.;3;Business;Ref249;Q2;2018
Open innovation describes a model of innovation that has gathered increasing consensus both in the literature and among practitioners. Studies on open innovation have shown how organizations can benefit from interaction with other subjects to foster their innovation activities. Somewhat surprisingly, although such interactions entail complex negotiations, very few studies have organically analyzed the role of negotiation from an open innovation perspective, although many of them emphasize its importance in successful collaborations. This article aims to analyze the state of the art on the peculiarities and the critical aspects of negotiation for organizations that adopt the open innovation model. Thus, this article presents a systematic literature review that organizes and discusses the main contributions of 70 relevant manuscripts. Such studies have been classified according to three classes (preparation, bargaining, and other) and eleven subclasses. The article has implications for both practitioners and academics. Indeed, the review allows practitioners to identify the literature that is relevant to their own topics of interest, while the conclusions herein provide academics with recommendations for further research on specific aspects of negotiation and open innovation.;3;Business;Ref250;Q1;2018
"This paper studies how human capital can affect the relationship between open innovation and the financial performance of firms. The results demonstrate that there is an inversed U-shape relationship between open innovation and firm profitability. We also indicate how human capital (both quality and structure) will differently moderate above relationship: generally, higher the education level of employees will amplify the positive effect of open innovation, but for production-oriented firms, such argument does not hold; in technology-oriented firms, as the ratio of technical staff to production staff increases, the financial performance of firms improves as a result of the implementation of an open innovation strategy. However, in production-oriented firms, the moderating role is negative.";3;Business;Ref251;Q1;2018
Information technology enabled the development of the virtual environment, allowing collaboration with external agents and leveraging the open innovation process. Crowdsourcing is an example of this new environment, using collaboration to enhance capabilities and relationships and as a way to accelerate innovation. However, companies are still searching for the best way to apply the crowdsourcing to internal processes to create value. Based on this context, the general objective of this research is to analyze how Brazilian companies have integrated crowdsourcing mechanisms into the open innovation process. To achieve the objectives, case studies conducted in two Brazilian organizations from different sectors were applied. The results contribute to a better understanding of the adopted crowdsourcing mechanism and the adequate technological aspects that enable the operation of the open innovation process.;3;Business;Ref252;Q1;2018
Background: This article contributes to existing literature by examining the relationship between inbound open innovation and firms' financial performance in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. Aim: This article seeks to identify the factors of inbound open innovation and whether these factors influence the financial performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Nigerian oil and gas industry. Setting: This article examines 150 indigenous oil and gas SMEs in the upstream subsector of the Nigerian petroleum sector through a survey, using a questionnaire, conducted in 2015. Methods: The study applied the structural equation modelling (SEM) method. This method is used to test the relationships between the factors and to calculate the measurement errors in the hypotheses formulated. Results: The results show that technology scouting, vertical technology collaboration (VTC) and horizontal technology collaboration (HTC) positively and significantly contribute to inbound open innovation, which are thus significant in influencing the financial performance of SMEs. The size of technical staff and research and development (R&D) fund allocations also have a positive and significant correlation with the SMEs' financial performance. Meanwhile, the age of SMEs is negative and not significant in influencing financial performance. Conclusion: The results suggest that inbound open innovation through scouting, HTC and VTC should therefore be encouraged among SMEs to boost their internal capabilities, which have hitherto enhanced their financial performance. The management members of each SME should continually consider collaboration with the external actors because they cannot singularly possess all the innovative skills required in the industry. Also, each firm should commit itself to allocate more funds to R&D and at the same time should hire those who have relevant production skills and train the existing ones in their firms.;3;Business;Ref253;Q3;2018
In open innovation, firms increasingly rely on online consumer votes to evaluate ideas for new products and services. Votes can represent cost-effective external information about idea quality that can inform and facilitate a firm's task of evaluating and screening of ideas at the early stages of the innovation process. Challenging this perception, we proposed that consumer votes provided in open innovation contests can be socially biased by reciprocal voting. On the basis of theories related to cooperation and social influence, we argued that both gregarious consumers (those who solicit social ties) and consumers who initiate direct reciprocity (those who vote for others) signal a willingness to cooperate that stimulates reciprocal voting from peers. We empirically investigated consumer voting behavior using a unique dataset with information obtained from actual open innovation contests in which consumers could submit their own ideas and see and vote for the ideas of others. We found that both gregariousness and the initiation of direct reciprocity positively influence votes received. Such cooperation pays off for consumers because firms indeed use votes to inform internal idea evaluations. We also found, however, that the votes an idea receives during an innovation contest cannot significantly explain its later revealed quality. Reciprocity may be an effective form of cooperation among consumers, but it has potentially negative implications for firms' evaluations. Our results also indicated that beyond reciprocity, consumers and firms value different types of ideas, which further differentiates their evaluations. Thus, firms should not only be aware of social biases in votes but also account for the diverging idea preferences of customers.;3;Business;Ref254;Q1;2018
This paper focuses on craft firms that have contributed to the creation of a strong image of Italy in the world and encouraged the development of industrial districts and small firms in the country over the past decades. However, ongoing economic, technological, social, and cultural changes in recent years have made it difficult for these firms to survive: since the beginning of the economic crisis in 2008 until 2015, almost 94,400 craft workshops have closed, which amounts to a 7.26 % rate of decrease. In order to face these challenges, craft entrepreneurs must be innovative and review the ways in which they provide value to customers. By means of a qualitative explorative analysis, this study aims to analyze recent strategic directions undertaken by some Italian craft firms and identify the opportunities derived from them. It highlights three directions in particular: (1) to embrace the use of digital technologies, rather than viewing them as a threat to the firm's future, (2) to involve customers in the design and production processes and expand the firm's network, and (3) to offer a wide range of services in relation to their products. Following all three of these strategic paths will help craft firms to survive and increase their competitive advantage by capturing opportunities offered by new technologies and new ways to produce. This paper concludes that mixing ancient and digital knowledge in an open context of collaboration will allow craft entrepreneurs to positively look to the future.;3;Business;Ref255;Q2;2018
Open innovation has become an emergent topic in innovation management founded on the assumption that the development of innovative processes may lie outside the companies' boundaries. In particular, this paper has pursued to address one gap in existing research on open innovation, namely the investigation of its relationship with market orientation that promotes continual processes of innovation leading to higher customer value. Findings have shown how market-driven companies tend to overcome the classical view on relying innovation on internal Research & Development departments in order to become more permeable to the outside environment. In fact, market-driven companies develop distinctive outside-in, inside-out, and spanning capabilities that encourage the matching and integration of internal resources with external partners and open innovation emerges as an essential driver to preserve and improve their competitiveness.;3;Business;Ref256;Q2;2018
"The paper deals with a case study in an Italian maritime cluster seen through a multiple paradigms framework, based on Sustainability (SUS), Open Innovation (OI), and Value Co-creation (VCc). The proposed theoretical framework helps to interpret a true phenomenon consisting of the design of a new product with a prototype created in a network of multiple actors. The approach adopted stems in part from recent writings in qualitative research methodology and is quite apt in this context considering the qualitative, confirmatory nature of this work. The prototype named ""TESEO I"" was realized through open innovation aimed at sustainability, not only directed at environmental aspects but synergistically with value cocreation, which emerged from interaction among the actors, while also including social and economic aspects. The work concludes with a discussion of theoretical implications related to the proposed framework and the results that emerged from the case study, with both referring to sustainability, open innovation, and value cocreation.";18;Computer;Ref257;Q2;2018
The notion of Big Data' has recently been attracting an increasing degree of attention from scholars and practitioners in an attempt to identify how it may be leveraged to create innovative solutions and business opportunities. Specifically, Big Data may come from a variety of sources, especially sources outside the usual boundaries of organizations, and it represents an interesting and emerging opportunity for sustaining and enhancing the effectiveness of the so-called open innovation paradigm. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior works have provided a broad overview of the use of Big Data for open innovation strategies. We aim to fill this gap. In particular, we have focused our investigation on two types of companies: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and big corporations, reviewing the major academic works published so far and analysing the main industrial applications on this topic. As a result, we provide a relevant list of the main trends, opportunities, and challenges faced by SMEs and large corporations when dealing with Big Data for open innovation strategies.;3;Business;Ref258;Q1;2018
Corporate accelerators are organizational devices designed to bring together innovative new ventures and startups with specialist knowledge and creativity with the experience and funding of established companies. The main goal for the use of an accelerator program by an established corporation is to open up the innovation process and actively profit from the innovative capacity of new ventures. However, until now there has been little empirical investigation of the characteristics of this particular model of open innovation. This paper outlines the key features of corporate accelerator programs and presents empirical data on their characteristics. The existing literature generally reflects positive results from this form of innovation but displays a lack of empirically and theoretically grounded research of how accelerator programs work. Using a standard, holistic taxonomy for programs, covering such components as strategy, resources, roles and structure, we analyzed and assessed data from stakeholders engaged in this approach to innovation in order to understand the expectations and reasoning behind these programs.;3;Business;Ref259;Q1;2018
Open innovation is now a widely used concept in academia, business, and policy making. This article describes the state of open innovation at the intersection of research, practice, and policy. It discusses some key trends (e.g., digital transformation), challenges (e.g., uncertainty), and potential solutions (e.g., EU funding programs) in the context of open innovation and innovation policy. With this background, the authors introduce select papers published in this Special Section of California Management Review that were originally presented at the second annual World Open Innovation Conference, held in Santa Clara, California, in December of 2015.;3;Business;Ref260;Q1;2018
Collaborating with investor networks generated in the course of equity-based crowdfunding campaigns can contribute to the success of startup firms. Through a qualitative study of 60 European startups, this article identifies the type of inputs provided by equity investors, how these inputs are related to startups' and founders' characteristics, and startups' later performance. Startups exploiting crowd network are more likely to be successful two years later compared with startups that do not exploit the crowd, or acquire from the crowd product, strategy, or market knowledge. The findings extend existing research on the relationships between open innovation and startups by identifying the inputs provided by the crowd and how the use of crowd equity investors in open innovation platforms is related to later success.;3;Business;Ref261;Q1;2018
Online communities have become a vital channel for professionals to expand their networks and initiate new strategic collaborations. Such online behaviors have led to multiple types of innovation potential that are based on the co-creation of ideas toward new solutions. Yet, very little is known about the role of psychological ownership of knowledge in professionals' knowledge exchange in these communities that are based on voluntary contributions. We apply the psychological ownership theory and posit that psychological ownership of knowledge is instrumental to increased knowledge exchange intentions of professionals. Informed by the theory, our model incorporates several enablers of online engagement which could be associated with psychological ownership. Our exploratory quantitative study evidences that perceived ownership of knowledge plays a critical instrumental role in idea exchange behavior. We evidence how personal outcome expectations, organizational innovativeness and affective community commitment are associated with psychological ownership of knowledge which is an important predictor of intentions to exchange knowledge in open innovation communities. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.;13;Information;Ref262;Q1;2018
There is now considerable empirical evidence demonstrating the innovation and performance benefits that accrue to firms engaging in open innovation (OI). Here, we use novel data on micro-businesses to show that the average level of engagement in OI falls well below the optimal level, a finding that reflects that of other empirical studies. We identify and examine three market failures which may help to explain this result. These relate to a lack of understanding of the potential benefits of OI by firms, a lack of information about the capabilities of potential partners and a lack of information about the trustworthiness of potential partners. Our findings provide evidence that policy initiatives designed to offset these information failures are likely to increase the range of partners with which firms engage with significant benefits for innovation.;3;Business;Ref263;Q1;2018
"The use of external knowledge for innovation (i.e., inbound or outside-in open innovation) has received substantial attention in the innovation literature, However, the ""human side"" of open innovation is still poorly understood. We consider the role of employee characteristics with respect to predicting firm-level openness. Drawing on the human capital, learning and creativity literatures, we theorize that knowledge diversity of the firm's employees is positively associated with employees' ability to identify and absorb external knowledge, which aggregates to increased firm-level openness that is, firms' use of external knowledge in their pursuit of innovation. Based on a combination of three data sources, namely, two survey data sources and register data, we find support for our hypothesis that employees' educational diversity is positively associated with firm-level openness. However, we find no direct association between employees' work history diversity and firm-level openness but rather as also hypothesized a conditional relationship based on educational background, which implies that diverse work history only has a positive impact at higher levels of educational diversity. To reduce endogeneity concerns, we undertake a series of robustness checks.";3;Business;Ref264;Q1;2018
"What happens when firms in an oligopolistic industry find themselves lagging behind in a potentially dominant technology? If R&D costs are significant and catch-up is key, technology laggards must turn to each other and open up their innovation processes in order to survive. This article uses a real options framework to explain the motives of bitter rivals to engage in collaborative relationships in order to catch up with industry leaders in specific technologies. It shows that ex ante, their interests converge and this lays the foundation of ""catch-up alliances"": competitors open up to catch up. However, they often bring vastly different resources to the alliance and, in the process of cooperation, what they learn may cause their interests to diverge. Furthermore, some participants may discount a technology trajectory on the basis of what they learn, and terminate efforts in that area. Therefore, the ""road not taken"" may be a valuable outcome of the open innovation alliance. This article uses the case of a global alliance in hybrid electric drivetrain automotive technology as the study context, and it analyzes the implications for managers facing similar decisions.";3;Business;Ref265;Q1;2018
The search for partners in open innovation settings often consumes substantial time and managerial attention. Yet, organizations tend to get trapped in local search, which typically leads to collaboration with partners already known to them. To improve the search for partners, this article develops a tool that exploits the power of state-of-the-art information technology. In a sample of 33 search queries conducted in six innovation intermediaries, it studies differences between search with and without the use of our tool. The tests confirm the tool's effectiveness and efficiency, and highlight the importance of searching with keywords that represent the core roles and activities of a firm, next to keywords referring to market and technology characteristics. Network visualization and semantic algorithms thus appear to facilitate the effort to identify distant partners. The article also finds that local partners are not that easy to find as commonly assumed.;3;Business;Ref266;Q1;2018
"Despite growing interest of Open Innovation (OI) in Software Engineering (SE), little is known about what triggers software organizations to adopt it and how this affects SE practices. OI can be realized in numerous of ways, including Open Source Software (OSS) involvement. Outcomes from OI are not restricted to product innovation but also include process innovation, e.g. improved SE practices and methods. This study explores the involvement of a software organization (Sony Mobile) in OSS communities from an OI perspective and what SE practices (requirements engineering and testing) have been adapted in relation to OI. It also highlights the innovative outcomes resulting from OI. An exploratory embedded case study investigates how Sony Mobile use and contribute to Jenkins and Gerrit; the two central OSS tools in their continuous integration tool chain. Quantitative analysis was performed on change log data from source code repositories in order to identify the top contributors and triangulated with the results from five semi-structured interviews to explore the nature of the commits. The findings of the case study include five major themes: i) The process of opening up towards the tool communities correlates in time with a general adoption of OSS in the organization. ii) Assets not seen as competitive advantage nor a source of revenue are made open to OSS communities, and gradually, the organization turns more open. iii) The requirements engineering process towards the community is informal and based on engagement. iv) The need for systematic and automated testing is still in its infancy, but the needs are identified. v) The innovation outcomes included free features and maintenance, and were believed to increase speed and quality in development. Adopting OI was a result of a paradigm shift of moving from Windows to Linux. This shift enabled Sony Mobile to utilize the Jenkins and Gerrit communities to make their internal development process better for its software developers and testers.";5;Computer;Ref267;Q1;2018
Although open innovation approaches were introduced because of firms' decreased innovation efficiency in a rapidly changing environment, few studies shed light on the effects of open innovation on innovation efficiency. Additionally, previous studies shed minimal light on open innovation practices in the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) context. This study attempts to remedy these research gaps using a unique dataset of Korean SMEs in manufacturing industries. I examined the effects of SMEs' two inbound open innovation activities, external search and collaboration activities, on innovation efficiency. To measure SMEs' innovation efficiency scores, I used the data envelopment analysis method, which calculates the relative innovation efficiency scores among them. The results revealed external search activities of SMEs improve their innovation efficiency, whereas their collaboration activities decrease their innovation efficiency. I also found the positive effect of SMEs' external search activities on innovation efficiency is weakened by their internal R&D capacity. Nevertheless, with higher levels of internal R&D capacity, SMEs can improve their innovation efficiency through collaboration activities. Furthermore, the results showed the effects of these two inbound open innovation activities alter through the SMEs' growth phases and the effects of collaboration activities on SMEs' innovation efficiency and innovative performance are different.;3;Business;Ref268;Q3;2018
This study investigates two types of firm capabilities (network and innovation) that could enhance the effects of open innovation activities (inbound and outbound) on radical innovation with the consideration of environmental dynamism. Based on a cross-industry survey of 201 Asian firms, we find that the effectiveness of firm capabilities and open innovation activities is contingent on the level of environmental dynamism. Specifically, when the level of environmental dynamism increases, inbound activities, network capabilities, and innovation capabilities are able to enhance radical innovation. In addition, the level of environmental dynamism moderates the effect of network capabilities on both inbound and outbound activities in creating radical innovation, but not so with the effect of innovation capabilities. Overall, this study contributes to the open innovation literature by shedding light on important complementarities between inbound/outbound activities and specific types of firm-enabled capabilities (network and innovation) under conditions of environmental dynamism.;3;Business;Ref269;Q3;2018
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore open innovation (OI) collaborations between high-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large customers. The research aims to add new insights into how smaller firms attract and build trusting relationships with larger customers for the purpose of innovation, and to highlight customers' contribution in SMEs' innovation process. Design/methodology/approach - This exploratory research is based on three case studies and adopts a process perspective to gather qualitative data on OI collaborations, focusing on the inherent dynamics, and evolution in long-term relationships. Findings - The study provides insights into how SMEs develop OI relationships with both industry and research customers by building trust through various mechanisms. Motivated by the potential benefits of OI in strengthening the firms' technological edge, the SME managers proactively and strategically developed and managed their OI relationships. The results proved that large customers contributed greatly to the SMEs' innovation processes both directly and indirectly. Practical implications - The research provides advice for smaller firms which are considering adopting an OI strategy with customers through mechanisms such as trust building and enhancing legitimacy. Originality/value - The research adds to the OI literature on SMEs by exploring how smaller firms manage OI challenges, exploit benefits, and develop trusting relationships with larger customers and research institutions.;3;Business;Ref270;Q2;2018
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to highlight the main Intellectual Property (IP) protection strategies adopted in the R&D phases of a company operating in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, according to an open innovation (OI) approach. Design/methodology/approach In order to assess how R&D intensive firms adopt IP strategies during OI practices, this research uses a single case-study design. The case has been studied over an extended period of time (from 2008 to 2015), triangulating data and information by means of multiple interviews with different key informants and projects documents. The novelty of the research justifies the use of a single case study. Findings The study reveals how a mix of formal and informal tools for IP protection are used, with a final attempt to maintain control over different technological solutions during their validation process and profiting from stable R&D collaborations with research partners. Research limitations/implications Limitations of the study relate to the single case study methodology as well as to some peculiarities of the analyzed company and of the Bio-Pharmaceutical industry. Practical implications Research managers could find some food for thought in the adoption of OI approaches for reducing costs and risks associated with technological uncertainty, with particular attention to the strategic role of IP rights. Originality/value Despite knowledge protection being widely recognized to be a critical issue for implementing OI approaches, how IP strategies should be used in the different phases of R&D is still debatable. Moreover, few empirical studies relate to the adoption of optimal combinations of IP tools in relation to the different R&D phases in such technology intensive industries as the bio-pharmaceutical industry.;3;Business;Ref271;Q1;2018
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between the use of open innovation (OI) practices and firm performance, and the role of organizational mechanisms (OMs) (formalization and decentralization) as moderator variables. Design/methodology/approach - The authors build a theoretical framework to define a set of hypotheses that are then verified in an empirical study. These theoretical propositions are tested by using the data gathered from a survey addressed to 244 firms in Spanish low- and medium-technology industries. Findings - With regard to inbound practices, the practices oriented to cooperate with partners in a R&D context have a positive influence. The results show that outbound practices, either by direct generation of revenues from licensing payments or, more indirectly, through the indirect marketing and technical benefits that can stem from revealing have a positive effect on firm performance. Coupled practices, which are related to participation in clusters and innovation networks, have the highest impact on firm performance. In the industrial context examined, decentralization exerts a positive effect which enhances the effect of outbound practices meanwhile formalization reduces their positive effect. Practical implications - This study helps practitioners in low- and medium-technology firms to determine which OI practices are most beneficial to firm performance and how formalization and decentralization can influence the relationship between OI and firm performance. Originality/value - This study helps determine the influence of OI practices in terms of inbound, outbound and coupled types through an analysis of low- and medium-technology firms. The OI literature is enriched by the types herein of the role of OMs, which includes an analysis of how formalization and decentralization moderate the influence of OI practices on firm performance.;3;Business;Ref272;Q1;2018
Purpose This paper aims to explore the direct effects of open innovation (OI) on firms' innovative performance, and to examine the moderating effects of knowledge attributes, including knowledge distance, knowledge embeddedness and partner opportunism on this relationship. Design/methodology/approach Survey data of 247 samples from China were used to test the proposed model through hierarchical regression analysis. Findings The findings indicate that the dimensions of OI are positively related to innovative performance. The results also reveal that knowledge distance positively moderates the relationship between inbound OI and innovative performance, whereas knowledge embeddedness negatively affects that relationship. Knowledge embeddedness negatively affects the relationship between inbound OI and innovative performance, whereas knowledge distance positively moderates that relationship. Thus, a new finding is proposed that knowledge attributes could align effectively with specific OI type to achieve superior innovation outcomes. In addition, the empirical results suggest that partner opportunism plays a negative moderating role on the relationship between outbound OI and innovative performance. Originality/value The proposed view that a firm's innovation outputs will be superior when its knowledge attributes effectively align with OI enriches studies of the OI context and expands the literature of both the resource-based view and the knowledge-based view. Furthermore, this study provides insights into how OI benefits can be influenced by external contexts from the perspective of partners' opportunistic behaviour.;3;Business;Ref273;Q2;2018
The present study was conducted in Semnan Science and Technology Park and aimed to analyze the relationship among intellectual property rights, open innovation, and organizational performance of 30 New Technology Based Firms (NTBFs). Senior managers, middle managers, and business owners were considered as appropriate respondents for study. A total of 140 questionnaires were distributed among the respondents, and 126 filled questionnaires were returned. The research method used in this study is descriptive-correlation and the analysis was carried out utilizing Structural Equation Modeling. The factors analysis and the findings show that intellectual property rights have a significant positive relationship with open innovation. Further, open innovation has a significant positive relationship with organizational performance. Moreover, no significant relationship between intellectual property rights and organizational performance was established. But, intellectual property rights affect organizational performance positively, through open innovation acting as a mediator.;7;Education;Ref274;Q2;2018
Purpose - Open innovation communities are a growing trend across diverse industries because they provide opportunities of collaborating with customers and exploiting their knowledge effectively. Although open innovation communities can be strategic assets that can help firms innovate, firms nonetheless face the challenge of information overload incurred due to the characteristic of the community. The purpose of this paper is to mitigate the problem of information overload in an open innovation environment. Design/methodology/approach - This study chose MyStarbucksIdea. com (MSI) as a target open innovation community in which customers share their ideas. The authors analyzed a large data set collected from MSI utilizing text mining techniques including TF-IDF and sentiment analysis, while considering both term and non-term features of the data set. Those features were used to develop classification models to calculate the adoption probability of each idea. Findings - The results showed that term and non-term features play important roles in predicting the adoptability of ideas and the best classification accuracy was achieved by the hybrid classification models. In most cases, the precisions of classification models decreased as the number of recommendations increased, while the models' recalls and F1s increased. Originality/value - This research dealt with the problem of information overload in an open innovation context. A large amount of customer opinions from an innovation community were examined and a recommendation system to mitigate the problem was proposed. Using the proposed system, the firm can get recommendations for ideas that could be valuable for its business innovation in the idea generation phase, thereby resolving the information overload and enhancing the effectiveness of open innovation.;5;Computer;Ref275;Q1;2018
"Purpose This paper aims to visualize the communication processes between stakeholders who discuss, reach consensus and engage with user-generated ideas through an open innovation platform facilitated by Destination Management Organization (DMO). Design/methodology/approach Various discussion and interaction styles between the different types of stakeholders on the innovation platform are analyzed using quantitative content analysis. Likewise, perceived issues among the stakeholders that motivate collaboration and consensus are identified. Findings This paper identifies that stakeholders interact with each other, reach agreements and solve joint problems on the platform by using predominantly constructive interaction styles. Meanwhile, feasibility and strategic issues appear to be the most dominant topics when discussing the fruition of ideas; however, this depends significantly on the category of the idea. Practical implications DMOs are given an understanding of why and how stakeholders engage with a certain idea and the kind of challenges they perceive when pursuing the execution of an idea. DMOs are advised to carefully design an open innovation platform to facilitate effective online discussions that may lead to working groups. Originality/value There is a scarcity of approaches in the field of tourism that invite stakeholders to innovate. This study aims to close this gap in tourism research by identifying how and which stakeholders respond to an invitation from a DMO to engage in an open innovation platform and, subsequently, how they interact with other partners to foster collaborative innovation projects in their destination.";19;Social;Ref276;Q1;2018
"Purpose - The rising need to innovate and obtain knowledge from more distant knowledge sources calls for new innovation strategies and a better integration of other external actors who lie outside the traditional automotive supply chain. Such an open innovation strategy challenges organizational boundaries both on the firm and supply chain level, yet our understanding of the functioning of such boundaries and how they can be managed to allow for purposive knowledge flows is limited. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In a longitudinal case study, the authors trace the development of the first open innovation network in the German automotive industry over a period of five years based on archival data, semi-structured interviews, and field observations. Findings - While the automotive industry is advanced in collaborating with suppliers for innovation, routines for assessing and integrating ideas from sources outside the supply chain are still underdeveloped. The authors show which current knowledge boundaries pose obstacles for open innovation initiatives in this industry, and how they could be mediated through the involvement of gatekeepers. Originality/value - The authors challenge and clarify the notion of the ""permeability of organizational boundaries"" in the open innovation literature and investigate the role of gatekeepers for open innovation.";3;Business;Ref277;Q1;2018
Through their role, entrepreneurs differently contribute to economic activity and economic development of national economies. Some of them are driven by the development of new products/services and new markets, others try to increase their business and number of employees in line with their company's needs, while some of them see their opportunity in other markets, often beyond the borders of their country. The key issue, as well as the overall orientation of this research, is related to the analysis of the impact of entrepreneurs' aspiration (innovation, growth and internationalization) on the technological orientation, i.e. the use of new technologies in entrepreneurial venture. In order to provide deeper insight into the subject of the research, the analysis extends to cooperation with other organizations for the implementation of the open innovation strategy. The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of entrepreneurs' aspirations on technological orientation of entrepreneurs and their cooperative capacities for the development of open innovations, and to analyze the impact of technological orientation of entrepreneurs on the implementation of the open innovation strategy. The main source of data of the analyzed factors (variables) in this study is the GEM research database for 2012. The results of path analyses of Structural Equation Modelling indicate a positive direct and indirect impact of innovation as well as entrepreneurs' aspirations and business internationalization on technological orientation of entrepreneurs and cooperation with other organizations. The positive impact was not found during the analysis of the impact of business growth and its direct impact on the technological orientation of entrepreneurs, as well as the indirect impact on cooperation with other organizations. However, when observing the growth of business enterprise and its direct impact on cooperation with other organizations, the positive impact of the observed variable is identified.;3;Business;Ref278;Q2;2018
Purpose This manuscript aims to integrate the relationship and knowledge-based theoretical perspectives of open innovation to provide a framework that identifies and classifies eight critical dimensions that influence the effectiveness of interfirm open innovation. Design/methodology/approach The literature on interfirm open innovation is reviewed. Internal firm factors and external interfirm factors of open innovation are explored. Findings The manuscript identifies four internal firm factors of absorptive capacity, control of knowledge input, relational capability and coordination capability. Further, the synthesis identifies four external firm factors of distribution of knowledge input, appropriation of knowledge output, network position and network diversity. Practical implications The organizing framework facilitates the development of eight research propositions to guide future empirical investigation. Moreover, the findings aid managers in understanding what dimensions they should consider to improve the effectiveness of their interfirm open innovation activities. Originality/value By considering both the relationship and knowledge-based perspectives, the manuscript integrates various perspectives of open innovation to provide direction for practicing managers and for future research on interfirm open innovation.;3;Business;Ref279;Q1;2018
Purpose Knowledge-based organizations is a new paradigm for business. Knowledge management (KM) is important for supporting core business processes. This paper aims to define an open innovation (OI)-driven KM implementation for effectively executing the support. Design/methodology/approach KM is important for supporting organizational innovation. OI plays a critical determinant role in defining the design of KM for effectively supporting OI. Further, the final goal of KM is to reach the success of OI-based KM implementation. A model is thus proposed for connecting OI as a driver to a design of KM and, in turn, KM implementation. Survey is conducted to collect data. Partial least squares is used for analysis. Findings The three processes of OI partially present significant impact on the design of KM process and, in turn, a noticeable achievement of KM implementation. The two KM processes indicate an interaction effect for reinforcement mutually. The findings provide rich evidence into the argument that OI-based KM implementation through the mediator of the design of KM process is important for a successful KM in organizations. Practical/implications While OI is a phenomenon that has increasingly become critical for the contemporary business, the design of KM mechanism needs to be adapted from the choice of OI process for guaranteeing the success of KM implementation. Originality/value Extant theories did not provide such an approach to develop an effective KM implementation in terms of the important management concept, OI, in organizations. This model empirically demonstrates its capability to work on this issue.;13;Information;Ref280;Q1;2018
Global competition has increased the pressure for firms to develop new and efficient processes in ways that are perceived to be legitimate. At the same time, there has been a realization that engaging with open innovation can improve competitiveness. Our study aims to address two research questions: (a) How does engaging with open innovation support an organization's process innovation? and (b) How does the motivation to achieve legitimacy affect the relationship between engaging with open innovation and process innovation? We use arguments from the resource-based view to explain how open innovation influences an organization's likelihood of introducing new processes. We then use arguments from institutional theory to explain how the motivation to achieve legitimacy moderates this relationship. We test our conceptual model using data from the European Community Innovation Survey administered by the U.K. government. Our findings and theoretical development support the notion that engagement with open innovation will increase the likelihood of introducing new processes and that the motivation to achieve legitimacy will affect this relationship. However, this moderating effect will be different depending on how engagement takes place. It will be positive on co-operation with external parties, and negative on the use of information. Therefore, when organizations co-operate with external parties and are motivated to achieve legitimacy, the likelihood of introducing a new process will increase. However, the effect is opposite in the case of use of external information. These findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between open and process innovation.;3;Business;Ref281;Q1;2018
Open Source Software (OSS) ecosystems have reshaped the ways how software-intensive firms develop products and deliver value to customers. However, firms still need support for strategic product planning in terms of what to develop internally and what to share as OSS. Existing models accurately capture commoditization in software business, but lack operational support to decide what contribution strategy to employ in terms of what and when to contribute. This study proposes a Contribution Acceptance Process (CAP) model from which firms can adopt contribution strategies that align with product strategies and planning. In a design science influenced case study executed at Sony Mobile, the CAP model was iteratively developed in close collaboration with the firm's practitioners. The CAP model helps classify artifacts according to business impact and control complexity so firms may estimate and plan whether an artifact should be contributed or not. Further, an information meta-model is proposed that helps operationalize the CAP model at the organization. The CAP model provides an operational OI perspective on what firms involved in OSS ecosystems should share, by helping them motivate contributions through the creation of contribution strategies. The goal is to help maximize return on investment and sustain needed influence in OSS ecosystems. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.;5;Computer;Ref282;Q1;2018
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between open innovation (OI) and radical and incremental innovation success in knowledge-based companies. The company's human resources and organizational learning capability are considered as the fundamental nexus of this relationship. Design/methodology/approach At the conceptual level, the paper analyzes the relationships between dynamic capabilities and OI and between OI and innovation success. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was used to study how innovation is implemented in 29 companies. Findings FsQCA identifies combinations of factors that facilitate incremental innovations. These combinations reveal the path to implementing company policies that enable incremental innovation and foster radical innovation. Research limitations/implications The nature of the study sample means that the findings should be generalized with precaution. The most valuable implication is the identification of combinations of factors that help companies manage innovation. Originality/value Scarce literature links organizational learning factors and OI to different types of innovation. The use of fsQCA to analyze the cases also marks a breakthrough in the innovation literature.;3;Business;Ref283;Q1;2018
Purpose From the organisational perspective, the authors know that management, including innovation management, becomes less organised by bureaucracy and administrative tools, and much more impacted by organisational capabilities, competences and hidden, soft routines, bringing innovation and creativity to the core of organisation. The purpose of this paper is to focus on competency sets for open innovation (OI) and is to provide recommendations for OI competency development in companies, linked to the core OI processes. Design/methodology/approach The research is exploratory and aims at theory-based practical indication combining deductive identification of competency clusters and inductive model development. Thus, the authors apply quantitative methods to data collection and analysis. The authors conducted an extensive literature review on competence challenges with regard to execution of OI, and empirical data analysis based on a large-scale structured industrial survey in Europe (N=264), leading to the development of competency sets for companies. SPSS tools are applied for empirical tests. Findings The authors develop a generic OI competency model applicable across industries, combined with organisational implications for sustaining OI management capabilities. The research clusters competencies based on the empirical analysis, which addresses the various challenges of OI, leading to recommendations for competency management in an OI context. Research limitations/implications The data were collected from one key informant per company. Although the authors made efforts to ensure that this was a senior manager responsible for innovation, the authors cannot exclude some bias in the way that OI activities and related competencies are perceived. Exploratory nature of the research, which calls for a more systematic investigation of the OI activity modes and the OI competencies resulting competency model. In particular, the competencies could be tested on an inter-professional sample of employees with involvement in and/or responsibility for innovation, development, and HR management, as well as on leaders of innovating companies. Third, although significant in size for the analyses undertaken, the sample is not large enough to enable a more fine-tuned analysis of regional differences across Europe in the way that OI is managed through the development and implementation of competencies. Practical implications The research contributes to the OI management field with an outlined OI competency profile that can be implemented flexibly and tailored to individual firm's needs. It brings indications for both further theory building and practice of innovation organisation, especially with regard to human resource development and organisational capability building for OI. Social implications The social implications of the paper result from the contribution to innovation management competency development in OI regimes, which is an important tool for designing contemporary educational programmes, contributes to OI management sophistication in business which is especially important during the economy slowdown and search for new sources of growth and productivity, and supports firms productive engagement in OI ecosystems and collective technology upgrading towards higher societal benefits and stakeholder involvement. Originality/value An empirically grounded OI competency model is proposed with an implication to support human resource development for OI. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no prior attempt to build such a model. The distinguished feature of the research is its extensive European coverage of 35 countries and multinational scope. The empirical validation strategy makes the research extremely relevant for management decisions related to human factors related OI capability development in organisations.;3;Business;Ref284;Q1;2018
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore the composition of skillsets in biotechnology from the perspective of employers and its relation to open innovation processes in the sector. It provides conclusions for HR management practice. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on job advertisements content analysis and in-depth interviews with chiefs of research and development companies. It uses biotechnology as an example of industry where open innovation practice implementation is expanding. The authors have used data from American, British and Russian job search engines. Findings It is demonstrated that skills composition required in biotechnology does not vary significantly among selected countries as the market becomes increasingly globalized in terms of not only technology used but also personnel hired. Companies stress more on hard and digital skills, while soft skills appear to be a must have without saying, The mismatch between skills presented in the advertisements and articulated in the interviews has been found as employers tend to demonstrate innovation friendly company culture for possible applicants. Originality/value The present paper enriches literature on employee skills for open innovation. It gives comprehensive lists of biotech skills in-demand divided into hard, digital and soft categories and interprets them within the context of employee cognition and behavior. The new insight into employee skills articulated by the companies as a strong element of organizational culture is presented.;3;Business;Ref285;Q1;2018
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to propose a new statistical approach to evaluate complex open innovation projects on a quantitative basis. In certain circumstances, open innovation entails a radical change of policy that involves various different functions of a company such as R&D, production, and management over a period of years and gives rise to mechanisms of mutual interaction with several business partners, such as collaboration with other companies, universities and R&D institutions, and new suppliers. Then, the question arises of how to measure the impact of such complex open innovation processes on the overall performances of companies. Design/methodology/approach A holistic case study is applied to analyze the effect of open innovation projects on a corporate company's stock price dynamics. The scope is to identify two different scenarios pre- and post-adoption of an open innovation model by a multinational company, Fujifilm. In particular, a stochastic model, namely the log-normal model, is applied along with three statistical tests: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer von Mises, and F-test for equal variances, in order to verify if the adoption of an open innovation model causes any significant change in the stock price dynamics of the corporate company. Findings From the findings emerges evidence that open innovation projects have a moderate effect on Fujifilm's stock price dynamics, but a greater improvement of the perception of Fujifilm's stock value. This enhances the management and financial literature review by offering a novel, empirical perspective on the effect of the adoption of an open innovation model on a corporate company's stock price dynamics. Research limitations/implications This research is limited to a single case study, but it can be extended to other stock market companies and therefore improve on the present study. Originality/value An original application of Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to detect and measure the differences between the two regimes of pre-open innovation and post-innovation regimes.;3;Business;Ref286;Q1;2018
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to connect open innovation and entrepreneurship literature by focusing on the influence of entrepreneurs' open innovation mindset and alertness on a firm's financial performance in a country that has recently transitioned from socialism into capitalism. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on a sample of 188 entrepreneurs who answered a survey about their personality characteristics in Time 1. In time 2, the authors collected firm-related data from a national database on firms' financial statements. Findings The results show that an individual's level of open innovation mindset has a positive impact on entrepreneurial alertness. The results also show an important and previously under-investigated relationship between entrepreneurial alertness and firm financial performance. Research limitations/implications This study spurs research in the field of open innovation on the individual level of the entrepreneurs who have considerable influence on small firms' results, and draws attention into the under-investigated innovation and entrepreneurship agenda in a small and transitioning country. Practical implications Open innovation starts with an open innovation mindset of entrepreneurs, so entrepreneurs are those who set the open innovation path of firms. Originality/value While open innovation triggered interest among business practitioners and management innovation scholars, it remained focused on management topics connected to a broad strategic setting of a firm. However, research related to entrepreneurial companies which benefit significantly from external sources of innovation has received scarce attention, and open innovation on the entrepreneur's individual level even less so.;3;Business;Ref287;Q1;2018
"Determining the effects of open innovation: the role of knowledge and geographical spillovers. Regional Studies. This paper examines the influence of open-innovation strategies and knowledge spillovers on innovative performance on a large sample of Spanish manufacturing firms during 1998-2013. Although most open-innovation strategies positively influence innovation, some differences are found depending on the search innovative strategy: technological collaboration with universities, providers, and external research and development (R&D) advice have a positive effect, while collaborations with customers and competitors are not significant. Finally, the paper confirms the positive effects of involuntary knowledge spillovers only for product innovation and of R&D neighbours in the same sector; and the negative effect of R&D neighbours in other sectors.

In diesem Beitrag untersuchen wir anhand einer umfangreichen Stichprobe von spanischen produzierenden Firmen im Zeitraum von 1998 bis 2013 den Einfluss von Strategien fur offene Innovation und von Wissensubertragungen auf die innovative Leistung. Die meisten Strategien fur offene Innovation wirken sich positiv auf die Innovation aus, doch je nach der innovativen Suchstrategie finden sich einige Unterschiede: die technische Zusammenarbeit mit Hochschulen, Anbietern und externen Beratern fur Forschung und Entwicklung (F&E) wirkt sich positiv aus, doch die Zusammenarbeit mit Kunden und Konkurrenten ist nicht signifikant. Ebenso werden eine positive Auswirkung von unbeabsichtigten Wissensubertragungen - allerdings nur im Bereich der Produktinnovation -, eine positive Auswirkung von F&E-Nachbarn im selben Sektor und eine negative Auswirkung von F&E-Nachbarn in anderen Sektoren festgestellt.

Overview: Open innovation is an established approach to improve innovation performance, but many organizations have failed to embed open innovation in their innovation processes permanently and at scale. Building on an investigation of 756 international organizations, we show that the existence of distinct routines and organizational structures can explain why some firms implement open innovation successfully. We present a guideline for managers to master the organizational journey from closed to open innovation, moving their company from an initial state via pilots and exploration toward a permanently open state.;3;Business;Ref289;Q1;2018
We present a large-sample survey of open innovation adoption and management in large firms, a follow-up to a previous study. We repeat some of the survey measures from the first survey, finding that open innovation continues to be widely practiced in about 80 percent of responding firms. Outside-in open innovation is more often practiced than inside-out. In other words, large firms are net takers of free knowledge flows, in part because they are concerned about IP protection for outbound knowledge. When we added new measures to examine open innovation at the project level, we found that firms selectively manage knowledge flows into and out of projects and are formalizing processes as they move from problem definition to execution. We conclude with observations about the organizational challenges and risks of shifting to an open innovation approach.;3;Business;Ref290;Q1;2018
China's 'Market for Technology' policy has attracted much interest over the past decade. In light of a relative emphasis on the spillover effects of joint ventures, this study examines the transferring effects of Multinationals' (MNCs) outbound open innovation in such a context. A survey of 2071 research and development (R&D) contract transactions between Chinese entities and MNCs indicates both internal factors (e.g. organisational capabilities) and external factors (e.g. the role of Intellectual Property protection) affect the transferring effects, which reformulate the focus of the Policy from the relational dimension of 'Government vs. MNCs' to the transactional dimension of 'Domestic entities vs. MNCs'. We thus conclude that MNCs' active initiative in the involvement of technology transfer and the success of domestic transaction partners combine to contribute to the technology progress within China's 'Market for Technology' policy.;3;Business;Ref291;Q2;2018
This paper presents an empirical account of a phenomenon that we refer to as the reverse tragedy of the commons' in open innovation. The name signifies the under-exploitation' of intellectual property (IP) under weak appropriability. The name is this graphic because the tragedy is costly, and can also render IP effectively worthless and block innovation in the short to medium term. We propose that the tragedy is borne out of the interaction between enterprise characteristics, a competitive setting and the framework that is set by the policy intervention. This finding is pertinent to policy-makers with regard to the design of research, development and innovation instruments, as well as managers who must determine how to implement open practices in innovation.;3;Business;Ref292;Q2;2018
We answered to the research questions as follows. Has there been any change in the moderating effects of research and development (R&D) between open innovation (OI) and firms' performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the South Korean manufacturing sector since the global financial crisis in 2007. And, if so, how about the changes? First, with the increase in OI of SMEs in the South Korean manufacturing sector, their performance moved in an inverted U-shaped curve in 2005, and 2014 altogether. Second, the R&D investment by SMEs in the South Korean manufacturing sector had a net effect on their performance in 2005, and 2014 altogether. Third, the R&D investment by SMEs in the South Korean manufacturing had accelerated the effect of OI on their performance in 2005. But, the R&D investment by SMEs in the South Korean manufacturing sector failed to moderate the effect of OI on their performance in 2014.;13;Information;Ref293;Q2;2018
"Based on Actor-Network-Theory (ANT), this articles aims to analyse the origins and development of graphene R&D policies in Korea. At first, we have investigated the formation and variation of various actors through the application of the four steps of ""translation"" of ANT which is process of an actor aggregation: problematisation, interessement, enrolment, and mobilisation. Furthermore, we select three latent variables which represent the hybrid of networks, just like, media attention, government investment, and R&D achievements and look at the interaction of them with Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. In conclusion, this study presents a new research methodology that simulates ANT in connection with actual model construction and provides interesting implications that the media public sphere needs to be diversified and discussion of obstacles to rebel against the graphene network needs to be abundant.";13;Information;Ref294;Q2;2018
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of human dimensions, team climates, and technological features on Global Virtual Team (GVT) performance in the Malaysian Global Business Services (GBS) industry. Attention has also been paid to examine the moderating effect of team diversity and the extent of virtuality on GVT performance. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using structured questionnaire and tested using partial least square - structural equation modelling. The authors collected 263 sample and the assessment of reflective measurement models, structural model, reliability and validity were conducted subsequently. Findings - This paper found that team climates like team cohesion, team confidence, and team knowledge, skills, and abilities demonstrated different impact on the human dimensions which include trust and creativity. It will then subsequently affect GVTs' performance. Besides, team diversity which comprised of three major components that include age diversity, functional diversity, and attitudes/values diversity was found to moderate the relationships between the antecedents and consequent. In spite of that, the extent of virtuality was found to have no moderating effects on the relationships between the team creativity and trust and perceived team performance. Originality/value - As nowadays an increasing number of firms are becoming global, inquiring into GVTs efficient management is of crucial importance for successful implementation of open innovation practices, while GBS companies could represent the most suitable setting to examine the GVT's underlying principles. This paper integrates adaptive structuration theory with input-mediator-output-input model to provide a holistic study on GVTs' performance. In addition, this study also illustrated how the extent of virtually can be measured quantitatively.;3;Business;Ref295;Q1;2018
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to link crowdsourcing, operations management (OM) and project management (PM). The study demonstrates how crowdsourcing as an open innovation mechanism is operationalised within a complex PM context. Specifically, the study seeks to understand how crowdsourcing as a novel form of OM improves key outcomes. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted exploratory research involving five pure-play crowdsourcing firms based in the USA and Australia. Findings The findings indicate that the firms practise a form of crowdsourcing that allows flexible, efficient and low risk operations and links to contemporary notions of PM such as projectification and project society. The crowd can be used in a new manner to boost success factors tied to PM through open innovation and operational novelty. In terms of OM, crowdsourcing offers flexibility, speed, dynamism and scalability to project processes. Research limitations/implications This research is based on five case studies. Further fine-grained, longitudinal research is required to fully understand this phenomenon in a wider range of contexts. Practical implications The paper contributes to practices tied to open innovation and provides guidance on how organisations might use large crowds to enhance PM success. Originality/value The study represents early scholarship on crowdsourcing and project operations. It makes three contributions. First, the authors introduce a new theoretical framework linking PM and novel aspects of crowdsourcing to extend understandings of projectification, as well as open innovation frameworks. Second, the authors showcase the flexibility and fluidity of the crowdsourcing project process. Third, the authors examine crowdsourcing operations in terms of size, efficiency and scalability which results in timely and efficient output due to innovative technology, along with the element of trust among stakeholders.;3;Business;Ref296;Q1;2018
This paper uses case study method to examine the acquisition process of information and funding through the implementation of open innovation (OI) in new ventures in Chinese context. We find that in the process of accessing to the marketing or technical information through OI, the most important thing for enterprises is to establish trust and cooperation with familiar partners, and trust is derived from existing social relations. In the process of funding acquisition through OI, the most important thing for enterprises is to strike a balance between gains and losses.;3;Business;Ref297;Q2;2018
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a research model exploring the link between open innovation, customer knowledge management and radical innovation. It seeks to answer these research questions: is there any difference among the effects of different types of open innovation activities on radical innovation? How does the organizational learning ability influence the impact of customer knowledge management on radical innovation? Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on the data collected from a sample of 165 modern service enterprises located in the Yangtze River Delta region. The authors conducted a structural equation modeling analysis using SPSS and MPLUS to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings - The results showed that different kinds of open innovation activities had different impacts on the path to radical innovation. Inbound open innovation activities directly influenced radical innovation while the effect of outbound open innovation activities on radical innovation combined with the organizational exploitative learning ability is indirect. Similarly, the empirical results also proved that customer knowledge management had an indirect effect on radical innovation through the organizational learning ability, and the influence of the exploratory learning ability was more prominent. Originality/value - Under the background of the national innovation driven by the development strategy, this paper studies the impact mechanism of radical innovation from the perspectives of open innovation and customer knowledge management. Therefore, it is suggested that the enterprise should adopt open innovation activities to foster innovation performance, formulate a customer-oriented innovation strategy and invest information and communication technologies to enhance the organizational learning ability of the enterprise.;3;Business;Ref298;Q2;2018
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to satisfy a clear gap in the main field of open innovation research whereabouts a very little scholarship try to analyze the mechanisms of innovative milieu down smart cities environments by applying through innovative projects that seem to support efficiently the entry of private firms and citizens in public collaborations. Design/methodology/approach The research performed an exploratory and qualitative evaluation based on the case study method built on the evaluation of organizational behavior and urban boosting innovation through smart city initiatives. In doing so, after a literature review in smart city as well in lean methodology fields, the case of Turin Smart City follows. Findings As acknowledged by international literature, the paper shows how a lean approach enables local government to define and realize smart projects and initiatives in a faster and more effective way. Particularly, the government in one of the main cities in Italy, id est Turin, combines a lean methodology with the job-to-be done approach, according a new concept of smart initiatives involving a startup mentality for the lead users which enables interesting predictions relating the human aspects of open collaborations. Research limitations/implications The specificity of this inquiry highlights valuable insights from double-gate smart cities' innovation, social and urban as well. The research is largely interpretative and exploratory and while this provides a solid scientific foundation for further research, it does not, itself, subject any hypothesis to statistical testing and validation. Originality/value Since the city approached the smart city subject in a lean way, it was able to realize some projects in a faster way. Through specific initiatives, the city acquires the ability to involve more and better all its stakeholders such as citizens, companies, and public employees, among others. In this regard, the paper invigorates managerial debates concerning the urban and social aspects of open innovation ecosystems which represent in our minds a superior level of open innovation, testbeds of positive knowledge, and stimulus of knowledge dissemination process around the city.;3;Business;Ref299;Q1;2018
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand if and how the adoption of an open innovation (OI) strategy, that is acquiring externally developed knowledge, influences the innovation performance of firms and how this relationship is moderated by the recruitment of highly educated employees and the implementation of employee training activities. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an analysis based on the results of the 2010-2012 Italian Innovation Survey and considered only manufacturing firms. Accordingly, the econometric analysis was based on 2,836 firm-observations. Findings The study reveals that acquiring externally developed knowledge positively affects the innovation performance of firms. Additionally, while the moderation effect due to recruiting highly educated employees is not statistically significant, the implementation of training activities negatively moderates the investigated relationship. Research limitations/implications The present research confirms the positive effects of the adoption of OI strategies on the innovation performance of firms and, additionally, shows that implementing employee training activities may negatively influence the abovementioned relationship. Practical implications The present study suggests that firms acquiring externally developed knowledge should be careful in performing employee training activities, since they may hinder the positive effects of adopting OI strategies. Originality/value This study contributes to the OI literature, by showing the positive effects of the acquisition of externally developed knowledge on the innovation performance of firms and by analysing the moderating role of human resources management practices, which is an aspect scantly discussed in the literature.;3;Business;Ref300;Q1;2018
Purpose In an increasingly turbulent and competitive environment, open innovation could be critical for a firm's success, favoring organizational flexibility and accelerating innovation processes. However, sharing innovation projects with external partners often requires changes in traditional organizational behavior and visions of CEOs. The purpose of this paper is to theorize and empirically verify how the CEO turnover and some socially relevant characteristics of the old and the new CEO may impact firms' propensity toward open innovation under an integrated agency-resource dependence view and social identity perspective. Design/methodology/approach The empirical analysis was carried out on 264 companies drawn from 16 developed European markets included in the S&P Europe 350 Dow Jones index over the years 2006-2015. To test the predictions, the authors adopted regression analysis by employing the panel two-stages least squares model and the ordinary least squares econometric model. Findings Consistently with the predictions, the authors found that CEO turnover stimulates open innovation. Particularly, the results suggest that the organizational identity rationale may motivate a divergent propensity between insider and outsider new CEOs, with outsiders more prone to open innovation. The higher tendency of new outsider CEOs to undertake innovation projects jointly with external organizations prevails also within firms that experienced a long tenure of the former CEO, thereby suggesting that a new outsider CEO appears able to renovate corporate strategic directions also in highly orthodox organizational cultures. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that theorizes why CEO turnover might impact the propensity of the firm toward open innovation. The authors use an integrated agency-resource dependence perspective, and the results from the empirical analysis mostly support the predictions. Moreover, the authors adopt the social identity theory to show that the organizational identification of the CEO matters in the decision of engaging in open innovation.;3;Business;Ref301;Q1;2018
Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse the companies listed on the US stock market in order to investigate for the selected companies, called the Dividend Champions, the introduction of an open innovation practice. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design. This research is based on an empirical analysis undertaken with 65 listed companies in order to examine, in the first phase, the Dividend Champions. These firms have increased their dividend yield for at least the past 40 years. In a second phase, this research studies the application of an open innovation practice for those listed companies that have systematically paid increased dividends for 60 years and have, at the same time, beat the market. Findings This study reveals seven listed companies that, for more than 60 years, have regularly paid growing dividends and, at the same time, have beat the yield of the market (i.e. six out of the seven companies). The latter include: American States Water, Dover Corporation, Emerson Electric, Genuine Parts Co., Parker-Hannifin Corporation and Procter & Gamble Co. All of these corporations have adopted or implemented a practice of open innovation. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is among the first pioneer research work, based on the potential relationship between shareholder value and open innovation. In particular, this paper highlights the fact that US-listed companies can create more value for shareholders over a long period and, at the same time, beat the market by adopting different open innovation practices.;3;Business;Ref302;Q1;2018
"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the processes of open innovation in the context of a fraudulent organization and, using the infamous Bernie L. Madoff Investment Securities fraud case, introduces and elaborates upon the concept of dark open innovation. The paper's conceptual framework is drawn from social capital theory, which is grounded on the socio-economics of Bourdieu, Coleman and Putnam and is employed in order to make sense of the processes that occur within dark open innovation. Design/methodology/approach Given the self-evident access issues, this paper is necessarily based on archival and secondary sources taken from the court records of Madoff v. New York - including victim impact statements, the defendant's Plea Allocution, and academic and journalistic commentaries - which enable the identification of the processes involved in dark open innovation. Significantly, this paper also represents an important inter-disciplinary collaboration between academic scholars variously informed by business and history subject domains. Findings Although almost invariably cast as a positive process, innovation can also be evidenced as a negative or dark force. This is particularly relevant in open innovation contexts, which often call for the creation of extended trust and close relationships. This paper outlines a case of dark open innovation. Research limitations/implications A key implication of this study is that organizational innovation is not automatically synonymous with human flourishing or progress. This paper challenges the automatic assumption of innovation being positive and introduces the notion of dark open innovation. Although this is accomplished by means of an in-depth single case, the findings have the potential to resonate in a wide spectrum of situations. Practical implications Innovation is a concept that applies across a range of organization and management domains. Criminals also innovate; thus, the paper provides valuable insights into the organizational innovation processes especially involved in relation to dark open innovation contexts. Social implications It is important to develop and fully understand the possible wider meanings of innovation and also to recognize that innovation - particularly dark open innovation - does not always create progress. The Caveat Emptor warning is still relevant. Originality/value The paper introduces the novel notion of dark open innovation.";3;Business;Ref303;Q1;2018
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of inbound open innovation and organizational inertia on radical innovation capability (RIC). It also seeks to explore whether the existence of organizational inertia has a moderating effect and influence on the relationship between inbound open innovation and RIC. Design/methodology/approach - In this empirical research, the authors collected sample of patents in smart phone industry over the 2000-2016 period. Then, the authors examined the direct roles of inbound open innovation and organizational inertia, and the moderating role of organizational inertia by using hierarchical regression analysis. Findings - Results found that cognitive inertia (CI) has a positive influence on firms' RIC, but network inertia (NI) has a negative influence on RIC. CI also has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between inbound open innovation and RIC, but NI only has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between open search breadth and RIC. Inbound open innovation directly affects RIC. Research limitations/implications - The authors collected the patent data of this study within the single industry and excluded other types of industries. And it may limit the generalization of the findings. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for adopting an appropriate open search strategy and developing a better understanding of organizational inertia on firms' radical innovation behavior. The findings suggest future directions to technology intensive industries for improving their RIC. Originality/value - This study contributes to the relationship between organizational inertia and RIC within the framework of inbound open innovation.;3;Business;Ref304;Q2;2018
"The article identifies how the combination of concepts drawn from foresight and foresight networks can be used to help open innovation. We found that foresight can support open innovation by providing analysis that looks at key open innovation questions such as those around technology selection, identifying future customer needs and scanning for disruptions. Foresight can also help open innovation address some of the challenges that have been identified in the open innovation literature as barriers to effective open innovation. Foresight has experience around obtaining access to appropriate external experts and their knowledge; making sense of the mass of information that can emerge through a more open process, both areas that the open innovation literature has identified as being challenges to effective open innovation. Finally, a concept explored in this paper, foresight networks offer's open innovation new ideas in innovative collaboration forms and how they can be pivotal in innovation and in assisting open innovation.";3;Business;Ref305;Q2;2018
To create a sustainable future, innovations are needed that integrate socio-ethical issues. Responsible innovation provides a method for managing these issues, and tries to ensure that innovation is conducted for and with society. The application of responsible innovation in industry contexts, where many of these innovations are developed, is limited by challenges related to dominant business logics, stakeholder management problems and resource constraints. Open innovation is an approach more commonly employed within industry contexts, which involves activities that overlap with responsible innovation dimensions and practices. This means that open innovation could represent a way to integrate the management of socio-ethical factors into industry contexts in a less disruptive and costly way. This paper explores the extent to which open innovation and responsible innovation overlap and could be compatible. Both open innovation and responsible innovation are reviewed theoretically before an empirical enquiry is launched through semi-structured interviews (n=11) with entrepreneurs developing innovations in the context of climate-smart agriculture in Europe. We find evidence for compatibility between exploratory open innovation activities and dimensions of responsible innovation. Results indicate that the management of socio-ethical issues through open innovation requires sensitivity to ethical issues and a motivation to include ethical considerations strategically in innovation processes. These findings are incorporated into a provisional extended open innovation model for the management of socio-ethical in industry contexts - an Open Innovation 2.0.;1;Agriculture;Ref306;Q2;2018
This study examines how an open innovation program can be implemented in practice by a foreign company operating in China with due consideration of traditional supply chain management practices. A case study of an open innovation initiative in a renowned global electrical appliance company in China is explored. The study has found that supply chain managers can play an important role in innovation sourcing, provided an open innovation perspective is adopted. In addition, an open innovation framework complemented by an open innovation funnel is presented. The framework provides new practical insights for engineering managers seeking to implement open innovation programs. The study bridges the gap between academic studies and industrial practice regarding the roles of different functional units in an environment of open innovation.;8;Engineering;Ref307;Q2;2018
Online Open Innovation (OI) platforms like Challenge.gov are used to post public sector problem statements, collect and evaluate ideas submitted by citizens with the goal to increase government innovation. Using quantitative data extracted from contests posted to Challenge.gov and qualitative interviews with thirty-six public managers in fourteen federal departments contribute to the discovery and analysis of intra-, inter, and extra-organizational factors that drive or hinder the implementation of OI in the public sector. The analysis shows that system-inherent barriers hinder public sector organizations to adopt this procedural and technological innovation. However, when the mandate of the innovation policy aligns with the mission of the organization, it opens opportunities for change in innovation acquisition and standard operating procedures.;3;Business;Ref308;Q1;2018
"Purpose - The link between openness and innovative performance has been established as an inverted U-shape relationship, namely, the openness-performance connection is not always positive. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the concept of partner heterogeneity to characterize the influence of ""quality"" changes in partners on innovative performance, that is, the focus of this paper. Given that partner heterogeneity is crucial in explaining open innovative performance, it is also worth placing the examination of this key construct in emerging regions such as China. Design/methodology/approach - The sample selection of this study covers a wide range of industries, but requires that the sample firms be manufacturing enterprises with an open innovation strategy. With opportunities and challenges associated with partner collaboration toward open innovation, the Chinese province of Zhejiang has established its reputation. Thus, empirical data were collected randomly from data pool of Zhejiang Province Economic and Information Commission, as well as a survey questionnaire. Data were using a cross-sectional survey methodology encompassing diverse organizations, industries, and nations. Findings - Empirical testing of this assumption in a sample of 217 manufacturing firms indicates that partner heterogeneities, which are classified as organizational heterogeneity, industry heterogeneity, and national heterogeneity are all positively associated with innovative performance, but the strength of this association is influenced by environmental turbulence. Technological turbulence significantly and positively modulates the relationships of organizational and national heterogeneities with innovative performance. Market turbulence also plays a significant positive role on the relationship between national heterogeneity and innovative performance, while technological and market turbulence roles on the relationship between industry heterogeneity and innovative performance are not confirmed. Originality/value - This paper refines the connotative dimensions of partner heterogeneity around the core concept of partner heterogeneity in open innovation in the context of emerging region, China. The study presents a systematic, in-depth analysis, and verifies the impact mechanisms of partner heterogeneity in open innovation on innovative performance by integrating the resource-based view, organizational learning theory, and transaction cost theory.";3;Business;Ref309;Q1;2018
Purpose - Open innovation is of crucial importance for all companies operating in the economics of widely distributed knowledge. However, the effects of its disclosure remain largely uncharted in the case of service companies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to measure the impact of open innovation announcements on the market value (MV) of service enterprises. Design/methodology/approach - The research covered 398 open innovation announcements released by service companies. It was conducted in the whole of the European Union in the period February 2011-December 2016. The data were analysed in the short and long term with the use of event-study and buy-and-hold methods. Findings - The results indicated the significant positive effect of open innovation disclosure in both short and long term. At the same time, the market was not able to immediately fully value the information in the short run and tended to overestimate the positive effect of the innovation announced. No significant leakage and dissemination effects were observed prior to the announcement. There was no significant difference in the magnitude of positive and negative reactions to the releases. Practical implications - From the point of view of business practice the research proved the benefits of information disclosure and supported the long-term planning. From the investors' viewpoint, it signalled the small risk of significant fluctuations resulting from aggressive trading prior to the announcement and unwinding part of the acquired position afterwards. Originality/value - The paper attempts to fulfil the research gap on the impact of the announcements on open innovation on the MV of companies.;3;Business;Ref310;Q2;2018
"Subsequent to the decades of research and business advancement in sustainable development, the importance of sustainability is undoubtful; however, existing paths toward it are not yet sufficient. Correspondingly, innovation has recently emerged as a persuasive means to enhance sustainability. As with all conventional innovations, the integration of broad and diverse actors in innovation projects aimed particularly at sustainable development is essential, but it is argued to require reconciliation, owing to the peculiarities of the sustainability context. The innovation literature (particularly the open innovation stream) extensively investigates and is able to provide us with businesses' capabilities for integrating external actors for conventional innovation projects. Elaborated from the literature, we identify and conceptualize four capabilities as bundles of open conventional innovation capability namely, networking, competence mapping, relational, and desorptive capabilities. Starting from the conceptual framework of open conventional innovation capabilities, eight innovation projects aimed particularly at sustainability with diverse and broad actors were used as an empirical context for qualitative, multiple-case studies. The results suggest that open sustainability-oriented innovation capabilities conform to the open conventional innovation capability framework; however, the capabilities must be reconciled with the particular sustainability context. In particular, the results suggest that desorptive capability (the ability of aligning/empowering internals for external acquirements) requires particular and strong reconciliation with the sustainability context, whereas the required reconciliation of networking, competence mapping and relational capabilities strongly depends on the outcome characteristics. In this regard, the findings reveal that for innovations to develop a sustainable product service system that would dramatically change existing systems and consumers' lifestyles, capability reconciliation is required for all key partners of the project. On the other hand, for innovations to develop a sustainable product or service, established open conventional innovation capabilities can be used. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

"With increasingly severe environmental regulations, a pressing issue has been the need for firms to develop efficient strategies to achieve environmental protection and high productivity. Several environmental experts argue that firms can respond to environmental regulations through innovation; however, the question of how to innovate is unanswered in the environmental literature. Therefore, this study focuses on the open innovation strategy approach to respond to environmental regulations and maintain high productivity by incorporating the idea of innovation management. We first divide open innovation strategy into two modes of external technology acquisition: foreign and domestic. Next, we examine these modes' mediation effects on environmental regulations and productivity. In addition, we test the moderating effect of internal R&D on the relationship between external technology acquisition and productivity. Using data on 35 Chinese industrial sectors from 2001 to 2010, the empirical findings show that foreign technology significantly and positively mediates the link between environmental regulations and productivity, while domestic technology does not. Internal R&D investment, as an absorptive capacity, positively moderates the effect of foreign technology; however, it negatively moderates the effect of domestic technology on productivity.

To enhance innovative output and societal spillover of the European space sector, the open innovation approach is becoming popular. Yet, open innovation, referring to innovation practices that cross borders of individual firms, faces constraints. To explore these constraints and identify opportunities, this study performs interviews with government/agency officials and space technology entrepreneurs. The interviews highlight three topic areas with constraints and opportunities: 1) mainly one-directional knowledge flows (from outside the space sector to inside), 2) knowledge and property management, and 3) the role of small- and medium sized companies. These results bear important implications for innovation practices in the space sector.;8;Engineering;Ref313;Q1;2017
"This work analyzes the relationship between international inbound open innovation and international performance, including the complementary role played by firms' intellectual capital. Based on a survey of 8,973 Spanish manufacturing firms, the findings confirm that externalization by means of international inbound open innovation, both strategically and financially, favours international performance measured in terms of international patents. Regarding the moderating effect of intellectual capital, the results show that both human and technological capital boost the impact of international inbound open innovation on international performance. Organizational capital also increases the benefits of financial inbound open innovation; however, it impacts negatively in the case of strategic inbound open innovation. The additional benefits of externalization may add extra value to international performance. Copyright (c) 2017 ASAC. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.";3;Business;Ref314;Q2;2017
Sustainability oriented innovation continues to garner increasing attention as the answer to how firms may improve environmental and/ or social performance while simultaneously finding competitive advantage. Radically innovating new products and services to replace harmful market incumbents is central to this thesis, yet studies to date have found it to be a highly expensive process with high degrees of uncertainty and risk. Extant research however has largely neglected to examine the details of the actual product innovation process itself and has under appreciated the influence of corporate strategic context. Our paper addresses this gap in the literature through an in-depth case study of a sustainability oriented innovation process for a radical new product within a multinational life sciences company, DSM. Our findings identify five critical organizational practices through which strategic direction has enabled the innovation process: technology super-scouting throughout the value chain, search heuristics that favor radical sustainability solutions, integration of sustainability performance metrics in product development, championing the value chain to build demand for radical sustainability oriented product innovation, and harnessing the benefits of open innovation.

With the increase in climate variability, creating knowledge networks becomes important for leveraging the embedded resilience in the communities through cross-pollination of ideas, resources and institutional linkages. Communities have developed knowledge systems around climate-mediated environmental changes since time immemorial. Some social groups have capacity to cope with stress better. They have homeostatic advantage due to either accumulated surplus (Burton, 2001, Vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in the drylands, United Nations Environment Programme) or access to institutions, technology and social networks (Adger, 2003, Social capital, collective action, and adaptation to climate change. Economic Geography, 79(4), 387-404). However, these knowledge systems often remain limited as isolated islands of expertise or small local networks resulting into asymmetries of knowledge at inter- or intra-community level. Intermediary organisations/platforms become important to bridge the gap that exists among communities within the informal sector and also between the formal and informal sectors. The platforms like the Honey Bee Network (henceforth, the Network) have been able to facilitate both horizontal exchanges, people-to-people learning and sharing, and vertical exchanges, connecting the informal actors with the formal system. The variation in different components of an Open Innovation System is studied in this article through their degree of openness in sharing, self-governance and self-regulation. We explore different activities and institutions of the Network to study the degree of openness and how they contribute to make the 26-year-old ecosystem more sustainable. We draw lessons for other institutions, organisations, communities who strive towards an autopoietic system, that is, a self-designed, self-organised and self-governed system with a feedback system from within and outside. This may make the whole innovation and knowledge ecosystem resilient in dealing with changing climatic conditions and fluctuating environment.;3;Business;Ref317;Q2;2017
"The discussion of open innovation has always been centred on the organisation where innovation occurs. The focus would be on the inflow and outflow of knowledge into the organisation; several studies and cases published have addressed the concept around business (or government) organisations and their research and development (R&D) activities. The open innovation framework is based on a focal organisation, which is usually a business organisation that provides a platform for other organisations to collaborateeither helping the focal organisation to commercialise its knowledge and gain economic benefits or vice versa. This notion, we argue, is where an open innovation platform is 'supplier-driven', that is, 'supplier' indicating the focal organisation where innovation occurs. In this article, however, we propose an alternate framework for open innovation, that is, one that is 'customer-driven' where the customer organisation or demand-creating organisation provides a platform for open innovation. This alternate notion is derived from the case of the flagship applications of Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC Malaysia). The MSC Malaysia flagships can be seen as open innovation type platforms established by the customer, that is, the Malaysian governmentwhich provides the demand pull for creating an open-innovation platform. This framework of a 'customer-driven' open innovation platform could provide lessons for other emerging economies to understand how their governments can play a more active role, as policymaker and demand-generating entity, to create a platform for open innovation.";3;Business;Ref318;Q2;2017
In small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), where typically the decision-making process is highly centralised, important decisions, such as open innovation (OI) adoption, will be strongly influenced by the characteristics of their Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). Pointing the attention to the strategic leadership and human elements, this paper sheds light on the micro-foundation of OI by emphasising the role that the personal traits of key individuals in innovation. OI adoption could result in the enactment of several OI modes - each representing an opportunity of potential change (of market, of technology or/and of the organisation) - and this paper attempts to examine the relationships between the CEO characteristics and each of the OI modes. Our analysis, using Korean SME data, shows that CEOs' positive attitude, entrepreneurial orientation (EO), patience and education can play important roles in facilitating OI in SMEs. However, this paper also observed that the effects of CEO characteristics on OI adoption were differently configured according to the nature of each OI mode, for example, CEOs' patience and EO had different impacts depending on the degree of uncertainty in the OI mode. This suggest that OI must be understood as a wide innovation spectrum, and, to increase opportunities for successful OI adoption, CEOs have to attempt to compensate for characteristics they may lack by recruiting appropriate complementary top managements. The research has practical implications for CEOs and policy makers who are interested in enhancing competitiveness of SMEs.;3;Business;Ref319;Q1;2017
Facing increasing open innovation trends, Portuguese enterprises are considering the related processes and impacts. Thus, this work aims to identify the sectors whose enterprises most engage in open innovation (such as cooperation on this issue) and which sources/agents are most used. This is analyzed by sector and type of innovation as an interesting way of differentiation for better open innovation strategy delineation. Using the data from the Community Innovation Survey (CIS-2012), it first appraises the nature of the innovation process, either cooperative or firm-based, as the starting level of analysis. Then, it differentiates the results by sector illustrating which cooperation sources/agents are most used (scope) and relative intensity of use (scale). This is important to assess levels of openness and related factors. Results show that main innovating sectors in Portugal are of three types: research-based, knowledge-based and service-based. They reveal an increasing focus on knowledge and services, trends that have been leading to more active openness towards innovation. For instance, health and construction are increasing their openness for innovating and internationalizing processes. However, Portuguese innovation is still more firm-based (in-house) than cooperation-based, especially concerning new products' launching. This work and future analyzes around it can contribute to encourage the open innovation strategy in more sectors of the economy as an easy and effective way to cope with rapid trends and changes.

The importance of control in the success of a project was clearly established in project literature. However, the impact mechanisms of intra-organizational and inter-organizational control on the performance of new product development (NPD) performance did not receive considerable attention in the increasingly important context of open innovation. To fill this gap, this study explores intra-organizational and inter-organizational control and their interaction effect on NPD performance in open innovation. The results show that intra-organizational formal control and inter-organizational trust positively influence NPD performance, whereas intra-organizational professional control and inter-organizational contract control have no significant effect. The interaction effect between inter-organizational and inter-organizational control positively influence NPD performance. These findings provide new insights into effective control practices for improving NPD project performance in open innovation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. APM and IPMA.

This article looks into dynamics of open social enterprises. We used several research methodsliterature review, content analysis and case studies through intensive interviews via semi-structured questionnaire. First, we developed a research framework, expressed as the social open innovation dynamics model through literature reviews on social economy, sharing economy, collaborative innovation, open innovation and social enterprise. Second, we applied the model to ten Korean social enterprises and determined the success factors of social open innovation, as well as the concrete dynamics behind it. Main finding of this research are as follows. The success of social enterprises depends on the extent to which they strive to move towards open innovation. Adopting open innovation strategies seem to be a fruitful pathway for social enterprises to progress and grow in their operations.;3;Business;Ref322;Q2;2017
The lack of efficiency and transparency regarding cross-company collaboration in the field of open innovation often leads to cost intensive and unsuccessful products and services. This is because traditional approaches fail to cope with emerging requirements in innovation projects, e.g., the vertical and horizontal integration of strategic partners within and across the company's value network. However, to maintain their competitive advantage, companies seek a constant and sustainable development of their product and service portfolio. In this context, knowledge work plays an important role in the collaborative development of innovative product and service ideas. For that reason, knowledge workers need systematic support regarding both methodological and operational challenges. The concept of Adaptive Case Management emerged from the necessity to support knowledge workers in unpredictable and highly creative working environments, especially in the field of Business Process Management. Therefore, the contribution shows, both from a conceptual and technological point of view, how to combine those approaches to support knowledge workers in dynamic innovation projects. To test the validity of the concept, a software prototype serves as the foundation for interviews with experts of the innovation department of a large international industrial company.;5;Computer;Ref323;Q1;2017

In today's complex, constantly evolving and innovation-supporting manufacturing systems, knowledge plays a vital role in sustainable manufacturing process planning and problem-solving, especially in the case of Computer-Aided Process Innovation (CAPI). To obtain formalized and promising process innovation knowledge under the open innovation paradigm, it is necessary to evaluate candidate knowledge and encourage improvement suggestions based on actual innovation situations. This paper proposes a process innovation-oriented knowledge evaluation approach using Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) and fuzzy linguistic computing. Firstly, a comprehensive hierarchy evaluation index system for process innovation knowledge is designed. Secondly, by combining an analytic hierarchy process with fuzzy linguistic computing, a comprehensive criteria weighting determination method is applied to effectively aggregate the evaluation of criteria weights for each criterion and corresponding sub-criteria. Furthermore, fuzzy linguistic evaluations of performance ratings for each criterion and corresponding sub-criteria are calculated. Thus, a process innovation knowledge comprehensive value can be determined. Finally, an illustrative example of knowledge capture, evaluation and knowledge-inspired process problem solving for micro-turbine machining is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. It is expected that our model would lay the foundation for knowledge-driven CAPI in sustainable manufacturing.;18;Computer;Ref325;Q2;2017
"Urban labs are open innovation ecosystems, i.e. places, either promoted by companies or local institutions or spontaneously established by active citizens, wherein the current problems and challenges associated with a city are discussed and possibly innovative solutions are designed and implemented. Urban labs usually face complexity in managing the contributions of several heterogeneous actors. The paper presents the Urban Lab Methodology (ULM), which supports the management of urban labs by integrating Soft System Methodology with an open innovation framework previously developed by the authors. The former is a methodology to facilitate the structuration and solution of complex problems involving different stakeholders, whereas the latter aims at suggesting an association between the innovation context and the open innovation practices to be adopted. ULM is used to analyze the case study of Manifesto della CittA Vecchia e del Mare (""The Old Town and Sea Manifesto""), a urban lab created in Taranto (Italy) in 2014. The analysis shows that theoretical prescriptions are to a great extent coherent with the real course of action and ULM is relatively easy to be adopted.";3;Business;Ref326;Q1;2017
"This paper aims to identify the development of solar energy technologies through open innovation. Manuscripts about solar energy and open innovation published between the years 2000 and 2014 in journals indexed by Web of Science Core Collection were used to create a database and terms related to solar energy and open innovation were sought in papers title, summary and keywords. By using words ""cooperation"" and ""collaboration"" as a proxy to map open innovation, it was found that this approach exist widely for solar energy researches and most important publications was developed collaboratively. Social network analysis methodology was used to identified clusters of local, national and international partnerships, which prove that researches cooperation to solar energy technological development is true. International cooperation is prevalent in countries like the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Spain and Germany. National partnership occurs in Japan, United States, France, Italy and South Korea. China has predominant local cooperation profile, but it will be major international collaborative actor in solar energy researches next years. Also, a set of recommendations based on findings was provided to construct a better environment for cooperation and to improve solar energy researches.";3;Business;Ref327;Q1;2017
Our objective in this paper is to explore the impact of information technology (IT) on the performance of open innovation models. We study the effect of IT on the production of patents and product innovations. Our analysis of a large panel of Spanish manufacturing firms confirms that the effect of the proportion of external research and development (R&D) investments on the production of patents and new products has an inverted U-shape. The results also reveal that investments in IT positively moderate the consequences of open innovation on innovation performance by reducing identification, assimilation, and utilization costs. Our results provide evidence of the viability and benefit of a new strategic alternative to innovation that is different than the traditional process of vertically integrated R&D.;13;Information;Ref328;Q1;2017
Open innovation (OI) has become an established business practice followed by many organizations and industries. This paper extends understanding about how middle managers work with performance indicators to strategize OI by taking a bottom-up perspective in the organization. It draws on interviews carried out with eighteen (upper-level) middle managers from different global and internationally recognised organizations. Through an abductive study, we compare how these middle managers reason about their work with performance indicators to mobilise top managers towards an OI strategy. Findings show that the situational nuances middle managers find themselves in, such as the extent of strategic support for an OI strategy by top managers and the degree to which OI practices are adopted, plays a critical role in influencing how they work with performance indicators. According to these situational nuances, we distinguish different OI contexts which affect how middle managers reason about their work with performance indicators. We label the different types of reasoning as abstaining initiating expanding restructuring and retaining.;3;Business;Ref329;Q2;2017
Scholars have yet to address why and how open innovation model can be applied effectively within industries while diminishing its potential cost and challenges. In this paper, we extend open innovation model both theoretically and practically by identifying a) the boundary conditions that motivate firms within resource-based industries to apply the model and b) the approaches that have been implemented in practice in applying the model. In this multiple-case study, we explore why and how firms within the upstream Canadian oil industry have evolved to apply open innovation model over time to deal with the industry's challenges. First, our findings show that institutional forces, both normative and coercive such as social and environmental pressures, were the primary drivers for adopting open innovation. Second, by building on the taxonomy of meta-organizations, we demonstrate that an industry-founded and not-for-profit innovation intermediary, as a meta-organization, is a necessary tool to address problems of adopting open innovation. We argue that the experiments of the upstream oil industry to develop a suitable organizational design for such innovation intermediaries suggest that a moderate level of stratification accompanying either close or open membership is the most suitable design. The findings from this study can be helpful to other industries, particularly other resource- based industries, which seek to effectively employ the open innovation model through innovation intermediaries.;8;Engineering;Ref330;Q1;2017
Drawing upon data from the fifth UK Innovation Survey, this article sheds light on how management choices on the nature of appropriation relate to management choices on the degree of openness within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). To this end, our findings indicate a threshold effect of both informal and formal appropriation mechanisms on the likelihood of engaging in both coupled and inbound open innovation. That is, an emphasis on appropriation appears to be important in shifting firms from a closed to an open strategy. There is, however, little evidence that either approach to appropriation increases the extent of open innovation. In this, only informal intellectual property (IP) protection mechanisms associate with an increasing extent of inbound open innovation.;3;Business;Ref331;Q1;2017
"The study of open innovation has primarily focused on the benefits and consequences of inbound or outbound innovation exchange between firms; however, increasingly firms may be engaged in simultaneous inbound and outbound exchange forming a ""coupled"" approach. Furthermore, firms increasingly collaborate with communities as sources of innovation, but how does such ""community-coupled open innovation"" affect a firm? Through an in-depth study of 250 firms collaborating with a leading open source software community, we show how this approach incorporates not only the exchange of intellectual property but also the provision of help. We find that while community-coupled open innovation does not affect productivity, it can expand a firm's social ties, lead to a more conservative strategic posture, and shift its innovation focus. Implications for our theories of open innovation in the context of communities are discussed.";3;Business;Ref332;Q1;2017
Certain cultural barriers, such as insufficient openness, aversion to risk-taking, organizational inertia and specific syndromes could inhibit successful Open Innovation processes. However, how Open Innovation Intermediaries help in overcoming obstacles to successfully achieve Open Innovation processes, has not yet been analysed in depth. This paper aims to fill this gap, relying on extant contributions of Open Innovation processes, Open Innovation Intermediary features and types. Based on the distinction between outside-in, inside-out and coupled Open Innovation processes, the theoretical framework developed here identifies specific cultural barriers affecting each process and suggests which intermediary types could be more suited to sustain firms undergoing these processes. The framework supports firms opening up their internal R&D activities to choose the intermediary type most suitable for adaption to an appropriate culture, as well as overcoming any possible cultural barriers.;13;Information;Ref333;Q2;2017
The purpose of this study is to address the following research question: What is the relationship between open innovation and firm performance? The study built up a research framework with three factorsi.e., open innovation strategy, time scope, and industry conditionto find out the concrete open innovation effects on firm performance. This study adopted four different research methods. Firstly, we applied the aforementioned factors to a game of life simulation in order to identify the concrete differences of open innovation effects on firm performance. Secondly, the study examined the real dynamics of open innovation effects on firm performance in the aircraft industryone of the oldest modern industriesthrough a quantitative patent analysis. It then looked into the effects of major factors that impact open innovation effects. Thirdly, this study developed a mathematical model and tried to open the black box of open innovation effects on firm performance. Lastly, the study logically compiled research on open innovation effects on firm performance through the presentation of a causal loop model and derived the possible implications.;18;Computer;Ref334;Q2;2017
The main topic of this paper is the effects of distance between technology and the market, on open innovation. For this, we set up two research questions, as follows: Is there any relation between the distance between technology and the market, and open innovation? If there is, what differences are there in the relation among Fortune 500 companies, non-Fortune 500 companies, laboratories, universities, and start-ups? First, this study measured the distance between technology and the market of a patent by the size of its list of references and citations. Second, the OI network among patent application subjects was described based on patent similarity. Third and most importantly, regression analyses were used to answer the research questions. The first result was that there were differences in the distance and OI among Fortune 500 firms, Fortune non-500 firms, laboratories, universities, and start-ups. Thus, there are relations between the distance between technology and the market, and open innovation. The second result was that the distance between technology and the market was found to moderate the open innovation effect in Fortune 500 companies and laboratories.;18;Computer;Ref335;Q2;2017
Public research organizations and other government laboratories (PROs) around the world are being challenged to show how their research is contributing to public benefits and to commercialization in the private sector. At the same time, the private sector they are expected to connect with is challenged to define and further develop their business models in an increasingly open innovation environment. PROs have multi-dimensional ties with open innovation environments through their regulatory, policy, and program (e.g., research and innovation) activities. Thus, it can be expected that PROs not only affect and are affected by changes in business models among companies, but they also need to develop their own models to remain relevant and effective. As the equivalent of private sector business models, we propose six impact models for science-based government organizations. This framework provides a nuanced understanding of the contributions of PROs to open innovation environments. We illustrate its application and document a number of emerging impact models in a case study of Natural Resources Canada, a science-based department of the Canadian federal government involved in many industries and with numerous external contacts.;8;Engineering;Ref336;Q1;2017
In a case study of a Chinese crowdsourcing intermediary, we explore the impact of inter-organizational governance on trilateral trust-building. We show that formal control and relational governance mechanisms are essential for swift and knowledge-based trust in R&D crowdsourcing. The case also indicates that Chinese businesses continue to use guanxi (informal personal connections) as a relational and contingent mechanism to maintain affect-based trust, but guanxi is shown to inhibit the growth of Internet-based crowdsourcing for open innovation in China.;3;Business;Ref337;Q2;2017
Firms that engage in distant search activities seek to leverage on external knowledge to innovate. The firms' ability to acquire new knowledge depends on strong search practices and the corresponding absorptive capacity where the latter predefine firms' ability to span out of its core competences area, to follow the open innovation processes. Absorptive capacity is often seen as a precondition for the open innovation success. This research focuses on the cases of open innovation when the absorptive capacity is absent internally and is taken in charge by an open innovation intermediary that is capable to develop the potential absorptive capacity for the firm. Based on an exploratory case study of an intermediary platform that proposes novelty driven search practices ideXlab, our results demonstrate how intermediary can accelerate the absorptive capacity value recognition function and therefore, potentially facilitate further diffusion of knowledge. Implications for open innovation in the distant search contexts are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;3;Business;Ref338;Q1;2017
In light of the fact that firms increasingly use information technology (IT) for open innovation initiatives, this paper explores how IT investment influences their external search from multiple perspectives: breadth, and depth along vertical, horizontal and societal dimensions. The basic premise is that IT investment has inverted U-shaped relationships with external search breadth and depth. On the one hand, IT investment enhances firms' ability to acquire more information from external knowledge sources. On the other hand, however, IT investment can bring abundant information from external knowledge sources to firms, making it increasingly difficult to widely and deeply use the information from available sources. Beyond a certain threshold, excessive IT investment is likely to cause information overload, forcing firms with limited attention to narrow down and go less deeply into their external knowledge sources. By using a large-scale panel data set from German firms, we find empirical evidence corroborating our theory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.;3;Business;Ref339;Q1;2017
"There is a common agreement that innovation is driven by the people that form the heart of any company's innovation activity. Still, people perform innovation in a special institutional environment characterized by rules and regulations that might support or impede innovation. The open innovation paradigm expects companies to engage in external relationships for innovation; however companies often neglect the actual internal openness of employees, which is an absolute must before partnering with external partner's. The article finds that company innovation culture comes in five main forms: closed innovation (driven by internal capabilities); doing, using, interacting (ad hoc processes, no link to knowledge providers); outsourcing innovation capabilities; extramural innovation, no matching internal culture/procedures and proactive innovation (match of internal and external openness). The empirical analysis shows that the closed innovation behavior is by far the most widespread among Russian companies whereas proactive innovation behavior remains an exception in the overall sample.

The objective of this paper is to understand the contribution of networks embeddedness to innovation openness and performance. This study developed and simultaneously tested three hypotheses about:(1) The impact of open innovation on innovation performance,(2) The impact of open innovation on network embeddedness,(3) The impact of network embeddedness on innovation performance. Based on survey from 212 high-tech enterprises, LISREL software was used to test the hypotheses. The results indicated that open innovation both directly and indirectly through network embeddedness affected innovation performance. Consequently, enterprises should concentrate on cultivation and maintaining network embeddedness if they lead to improvements in innovation.;2;BioComputer;Ref341;Q4;2017
This article examines the impact of open innovation (OI) practices on the innovation activity of low-tech small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Different external knowledge sources are considered, and the ability of SMEs to acquire and integrate external knowledge into their organizational boundaries for innovation purposes is assessed. The research draws on a sample of 191 Italian winemakers. The results show that SMEs with higher propensity to access and use external knowledge sources show a greater ability to innovate and that their absorptive capacity impacts the use of external sources. Several implications for theory and practice are drawn, underlining a number of suggestions for future research.;3;Business;Ref342;Q1;2017
Scholars and practitioners have recently shifted their attention from traditional closed internal innovation to open innovation (OI). Building on both the resource-based view and the network perspective, we explore the roles of three types of informal ties (i.e., business, government, and university) in driving inbound and outbound OI, and further examine such effects contingent on market dynamism. Empirical results from our study of 260 Chinese firms show that all three types of informal ties positively affect inbound innovation openness, whereas only business ties facilitate outbound innovation openness. In addition, market dynamism strengthens the relationship between university ties and inbound innovation openness, but weakens the effect of business ties on inbound innovation openness. These findings indicate the salience of informal ties in increasing innovation openness and the contingent role of external market conditions. The findings contribute to the understanding of the drivers of innovation openness, and help clarify the differences between inbound and outbound OI.;3;Business;Ref343;Q1;2017
The Power and Energy (P & E) sector needs to respond to several challenges fostering investments in research and development. According to the Open Innovation (DI) paradigm, key stakeholders like utilities, vendors, laboratories, universities etc. should take advantage of external knowledge to improve their innovation performance. Several studies have demonstrated that firms adopting the DI paradigm are more likely to innovate. Despite the interest of P &E firms in enhancing their innovation capabilities, surprisingly few articles (usually case studies) described the implementation of the OI paradigm in P & E firms. This article fills the gap by identifying the key drivers that encourage a firm in the P & E sector to embrace the OI paradigm. The authors adopt a hybrid research approach collecting evidence from the literature and through a multiple case-study analysis involving seven British firms and universities operating in the P & E industry. As the drivers of OI have mutual influence, this article describes them with a fuzzy cognitive map. Finally, the authors identify appropriated policies to enhance the 01 adoption and, consequently, the sustainability of innovation in the P & E sector. A salient research agenda closes the paper.;3;Business;Ref344;Q1;2017
While recent studies shed some light on the performance implications of open innovation, there is a gap in understanding how firms can translate their openness into innovation outcomes. In particular, it is unclear whetherand if so, howfirms can create a competitive advantage in product innovation by tapping into external sources of innovation. To address this gap, this study conceptualizes multidimensional components of absorptive capacity and develops a nomological network that explicates relationships between these components and competitive advantage in product innovation. By marrying the open innovation and absorptive capacity perspectives, higher-order models of absorptive capacity are proposed which delineate the underlying processes to recognize, assimilate, and exploit external sources of innovation. The empirical analysis of the nomological network based on original survey data reveals important findings. First, there is a positive indirect baseline association between external technological resource access and competitive advantage in product innovation, mediated by the firm's technology-related capabilities. Second, components of absorptive capacity modify this indirect baseline relationship. Recognition capacity is positively associated with external technological resource access and therefore, operates as an antecedent to the proposed baseline relationship. Assimilation capacity constitutes a relevant condition to the proposed baseline relationship. The indirect association between external technological resource access and competitive advantage in product innovation is dependent on the level of assimilation capacity. Exploitation capacity has an additional and independent direct positive association with competitive advantage in product innovation. This study contributes to the open innovation literature by delineating organizational processes that help to explain interfirm differences in benefiting from external sources of innovation. In addition, this study adds to the absorptive capacity literature by developing and validating a set of measures that captures, individually and in concert, three components of absorptive capacity.;3;Business;Ref345;Q1;2017
In recent years, open innovation (OI) has attracted much attention in innovation management research. Although showing signs of advance, most of the existing literature still relies, to a great extent, on case studies and conceptual frameworks, with little empirical research in the specific context of small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This paper adds to the literature by empirically assessing the effects of organizational antecedents and innovation climate on OI as well as its consequences on firm performance in SMEs. In addition, the moderating roles of environmental dynamisms and competitiveness in the relationships between innovation climate and inbound and outbound OI are analyzed. To achieve these goals, this paper develops an integrative research model, which analyses the network relations using covariance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) on a data set of 429 Spanish SMEs. Results revealed that organizational factors such as commitment-based human resources practices have a positive influence on innovation climate and that innovation climate contributes to both inbound and outbound OI. Another important finding is that contingent factors such as environmental dynamism strengthen the positive effect of innovation climate on outbound OI. The main conclusions of this research can be valuable to SMEs that implement or intend to implement OI. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.;3;Business;Ref346;Q1;2017
The success of open innovation as a new paradigm to enhance innovation development has brought public authorities to incentivize firms to collaborate with external organisations. Such incentive is often provided in the form of public subsidies to research and development activities. Some studies observed that public subsidies are generally successful in pursuing the goal of promoting open innovation. Nevertheless, as the number of partners increases, the positive effect of collaboration on innovation performance is likely to decrease due to over search and over-collaboration issues. In this perspective, a mere increase of the firms' propensity to collaborate should not satisfy public authorities, which instead should carefully monitor how public subsidies can improve the efficiency of such collaborations. This article advances the literature about the relationship between public subsidies and open innovation by assessing how funds provided by local, national and European authorities are associated with open innovation efficiency. By analysing an extensive sample of 43,230 European firms, this study confirms that the three typologies of public subsidies are associated with collaboration in beneficiaries. Furthermore, the study shows that local and national subsidies are also associated with open innovation efficiency, whereas European subsidies are not statistically significantly associated with it This study provides theoretical and policy implications. In a theoretical perspective, it introduces the concept of open innovation efficiency, it analyses its public policy drivers and presents several recommendations for future research. In a policy perspective, it suggests explanations for the results obtained and advises policy initiatives to foster open innovation efficiency. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In line with the growing number and type of innovation sources and partners, companies' institutional set up to manage the potential problems of multiple sources and partners for innovation is increasingly challenged to develop and maintain effective and efficient corporate innovation activities. The paper highlights recent developments of open innovation in companies. Findings are based on company case studies involving companies from different industries and company representatives. It shows that open innovation is actually a paradigm long practised but the main efforts are targeted to continuously developing the organization and managerial model of companies to meet the new innovation challenges.;8;Engineering;Ref348;Q1;2017
"Is opening up the innovation process a ""must"", or rather an opportunity? This paper discusses whether closed innovation models are still suitable in the era of increasing technological networking, or is some degree of openness actually imposed. Starting from the premises given in the enormous amount of literature on open innovation, this paper investigates a case in the food industry, namely the Italian R&D subsidiary of the famous chocolate company, Lindt & Sprungli. The case concerns a company that states that it uses a closed approach to innovation. The paper shows what being closed actually means in Lindt. It also investigates why Lindt rejects an open model to innovation, and illustrates the actual characteristics of a ""closed"" approach in the open innovation era. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Entrepreneurship literature has proven the efficacy of an experiential and collaborative learning approach that promotes entrepreneurial capabilities, that is, risk-taking, positive thinking, vision, intuitive decision-making, creative problem-solving, managing interdependency, tolerating ambiguity and innovation. To advance this, we propose a Deleuzian-inspired theoretical framework for entrepreneurship learning around innovation based on a rhizomatic perspective. We offer an illustrative case and identify the advantages and challenges of a rhizomatic approach to learning.;3;Business;Ref350;Q1;2017
There are many examples of successful open innovation communities that have helped organizations to improve their innovativeness and solve innovation-related issues. But not all implementations have been successful. This article describes one such case, even though innovation was part of the organization's culture. We identify the challenges faced and the reasons the initiative failed. Based on our analysis, we provide guidelines and a framework for assessing the likely success of implementing online open innovation communities.;13;Information;Ref351;Q1;2017
This paper critically synthesizes empirics and issues in discrete inter-disciplinary literatures to identify 'open innovation' as part of an emergent regime of accumulation, overlaying and co-existing with flexible production, and encompassing novel firm-level strategies, new forms of corporate networks, and a disturbing capital-labor relation that informalizes innovative work while cultivating entrepreneurial but self-exploiting subjects. I explain the novelty of open innovation, its genealogy, and the implications for people and conditions of work as much as for firms in a new topolbgy of power relations. I cast the ensemble of strategies and tactics encompassed in open innovation as contingent, continually unfolding, and sometimes chaotic if not destructive for both firms and labor, in contrast to the celebratory tone in the business as well as geography and regional studies literatures regarding its benefits for competitiveness, innovativeness, value capture, and development. Open innovation- the externalization of innovation - entails long-run approaches to innovation and investment that are fraught with problems, prompting the development of short-term tactics to engage the challenges. One short-run strategy, crowdsourcing, bypasses the conventional web of inter-firm relations to connect digitally With individuals of the global crowd, enabling firms to reap the benefits of the crowd's innovative talents, often without remuneration under circumstances that institutionalize informal work. These neoliberal subjects are best understood in terms of multiple subjectivities. I close by connecting the crowdsourcing of innovative with non-innovative work, both of which are parts of the emergent regime associated with new hiring and work practices that usher in new modes of exploitation.

The concept of open innovation has gained traction among practitioners and academics. Many different aspects of open innovation have been researched, but the question of how to manage open innovation collaboration in order to achieve the desired knowledge flow across organizational boundaries remains only partly answered. Consequently, this article argues for the need to complement prior firm-centric perspectives by investigating the roles of senior management in the postmodern form of organizing that characterizes open innovation collaboration. A more in-depth understanding of managerial roles in this context can increase the chances of fruitful collaboration. Thus, the article uses an inductive, interview-based approach to explore senior management roles in two institutionalized open innovation collaborations, thereby creating an initial conceptualization of the role of managers in open innovation and forming a basis for further studies on open innovation management. In this respect, the article identifies and discusses additional managerial roles that appear to be crucial for open innovation collaborations. These roles are those of a facilitator, tactician, and sensegiver.;3;Business;Ref353;Q1;2017
IT services are overrepresented among high-growth innovative enterprises. The nature of innovation in IT requires knowledge search and collaboration, which together constitute the inbound open innovation (IOI) strategy. This study analyses whether the IOI strategies in IT service firms lead to different performance effects in comparison to other service and manufacturing firms. A quantile regression on multi-country data from the Community Innovation Survey indicates that innovative IT service companies share the same benefits from increased cooperation as other innovators, while displaying a strong growth dynamic compared to others. Therefore, IT service firms' growth differential may not be related to external cooperation and knowledge sourcing.;3;Business;Ref354;Q1;2017
This study tries to explore the impact of exploration and exploitation learning on organisational innovativeness among health service organisations from an open innovation view. We developed several constructs including realised absorptive capacity (RACAP), breadth and depth of external knowledge acquisition and tried to explore the roles of these constructs in the influence process of organisational learning on organisational innovativeness. The mail survey was used to collect research data from top hospital managers in Taiwan. The overall valid response rate was 44.23%. We applied a structural equation model to test the research hypothesis. Results indicated the breadth and depth of external knowledge acquisition would affect organisational innovativeness through RACAP. Exploration learning had a directly positive influence on RACAP and also had an indirect impact through the mediation of breadth and depth of external knowledge acquisition among health service organisations.;3;Business;Ref355;Q2;2017
Despite the growing interest, Open Innovation (OI) in Intangible Assets (IAs) research is still fragmented and displays a limited contextual focus. This paper aims to provide a clearer view of these issues and represents a first step toward filling such research gap. A systematic literature review and a synthesis of high-quality contributions with a focus on a general overview of research on OI and IAs in OI processes have been carried out. By critically evaluating the current body of literature and definitions, we have moved a step further toward comprehending the multiple facets of existing research and highlight several promising areas for future development. In particular, we have analyzed the role of IAs in OI practices by selecting a synthesis and a critical review of their different exploitations. We have combined multiple algorithms to produce a clear topical taxonomy of the multiple strands of research lying at the interface of OI and IAs.;13;Information;Ref356;Q2;2017
This study contributes to the literature on inbound open innovation in three ways. Firstly, it verifies the suitability of three groups of innovation activities (external information sources, cooperation and acquisition of machinery, knowledge or R&D) as indicators of open innovation, by modelling their relationship with the openness of the development of new products. Secondly, it relates these activities to three non-financial product-oriented outcomes of small and medium enterprises (SMEs): quality, product range and market share. When significant, the signs of the relationships are always positive. Thirdly, it is the first to link two streams of the literature on innovation within SMEs: open innovation and entry-timing. We distinguish between pioneers (the first to introduce innovations onto the market) and followers and find that most open innovation activities relate to the pioneering behaviour. This should be taken into consideration when designing public policies supporting innovation. Data include Spanish innovative SMEs from the Community Innovation Survey.;3;Business;Ref357;Q2;2017
Organizational sustainability increasingly focuses on how to manage new knowledge of ideas and practices that can expand business. Open innovation plays a key role towards effective strategic sustainable management. Through open innovation, companies can leverage knowledge management to an asset that promotes sustainable innovations that influence back organizational sustainability. This paper explores the case of a Brazilian family-owned company of rubber products, operating in the sectors of health, education, and coatings, which based on organizational sustainability uses knowledge to develop open innovation aiming to promote sustainable innovations. The methodology is an exploratory single case study research based on informal observation, semi structured interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions. The case study's results explore in depth the company's experience in adopting the strategic organizational sustainability using knowledge management and open innovation to promote sustainable innovations in accordance with the model of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for eco-innovation, acting as a driver for significant changes in the organization's culture in organizational sustainability.

Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine listed companies, grouped by sector, that for decades have shown a dividend growth. Referring to the food and beverage (F& B) industry, the authors have investigated the adoption of an open innovation model in order to fill a gap in the existing literature. Design/methodology/approach - This paper uses a multi- method design linking qualitative and quantitative approaches. The quantitative study was planned in order to identify some US-listed companies, called Dividend Champions that have distributed consistently growing dividends for over 50 years and have beaten the markets. The qualitative study was designed to provide insight into the adoption or not of an open innovation model by the listed companies in the F& B industry in the US market that were selected by the quantitative analysis. Findings - The research is based on an empirical analysis undertaken with 108 listed companies in US markets. In particular, the authors underline 20 companies that over the past 50 years have systematically increased dividend paid, and at the same time, have beaten the market (Standard & Poor's 500). In all, 30 per cent of the selected companies belong to the consumer goods sector, and F& B companies represent 50 per cent of them. All of these companies (The Coca-Coca Company, Hormel Foods Corporation, and Lancaster Colony Corporation) implement an open innovation model. Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, this is the first exploratory study based on value maximisation and open innovation. An open innovation model increases competitiveness and the durability of competitive advantage, which are main sources of value creation. The paper highlights evidence from the F& B industry, referred to as Dividend Champions, and the adoption of an open innovation model.;1;Agriculture;Ref359;Q1;2017
"Purpose - Innovation projects are often risky and costly. But not all innovation projects lead to commercialisation; some are abandoned, and these abandoned innovation projects can be classified as a waste of resources. Therefore, this paper studies the influence of different external sources and a firm's decision to abandon an innovation project. The purpose of this paper is to provide a broader understanding of abandoned projects. Design/methodology/approach - The data applied are quantitative data and the empirical background is the Danish Innovation Survey 2009. The sample consists of Danish manufacturing firms with ten employees or more (n = 840). The results are based on logistic regression analysis. Findings - Results reveal that firms should consider that the involvement of customers can lead them to abandon innovation projects. However, if firms combine customers with universities, it will decrease the likelihood of innovation projects being abandoned. A more in-depth analysis shows that the involvement of customers from ""Europe"" (countries in Europe excluding Denmark) and the ""US"" leads to innovation projects being abandoned while customers from ""other countries"" (the rest of the world, including China and India) have the opposite effect. Originality/value - The contribution is to the limited literature on abandoned innovation projects by suggesting that the type of external sources is a significant factor in firms' decisions to abandon innovation projects. The paper identifies that the involvement of certain external sources leads firms to decide to abandon innovation projects, and that the country of origin of the external sources is an important criterion to consider in relation to a firm's decision to abandon innovation projects.";3;Business;Ref360;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how organisational activities that formally provide employees with work autonomy explain the performance of open innovation (OI). Design/methodology/approach - The study reports the results of mediation analyses conducted on the basis of survey data from 307 firms. Findings - The economic benefits of both inbound and outbound OI are fully captured only if firms provide employees with time, freedom and independence. The results show that employee autonomy fully mediates the relationship between openness and innovation sales, while the adoption of inbound OI is positively associated with the introduction of new products. Practical implications - The opening of innovation induces managers to provide employees with discretion, as OI requires high levels of flexibility and experimentation. Originality/value - The paper addresses theoretically and empirically the role of job design in the implementation of OI, while also distinguishing between the effects of inbound and outbound practices on innovation performance.;3;Business;Ref361;Q1;2017
Innovation activities have become globalised and open in ways that were unimaginable 20years ago. These changes have brought new insight into research on innovation activities and specific innovation practices in organisations, including that previous research largely ignored small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper tests a variance-based structural equation model (SEM) for selected antecedents and determinants of commercialisation enablers on a sample of 105 SMEs from Slovenia - a small, open, post-transition economy with a dominant SME sector. The main contribution of the paper lies in testing how two specific open innovation practices (open innovation information exchange and open innovation collaboration) impact the commercialisation enablers of high-tech SMEs through their innovation activities (antecedent) and their innovativeness (determinant). Both open innovation practices show statistically significant effect on high-tech SMEs' innovativeness, thus supporting the idea that both collaboration and information exchange lead to more innovativeness in high-tech SMEs. They also show a high impact of internal (organisational) factors on innovation activities of and a high impact of innovativeness on the commercialisation enablers of high-tech SMEs.;3;Business;Ref362;Q2;2017
Purpose - This study examines how technology-intensive small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engage in open innovation. The purpose of this paper is to add to the literature on open innovation in SMEs, which has received considerably less attention than open innovation in large companies. Also, the study adds on the literature on open innovation in the commercialization phase. Design/methodology/approach - A multiple case study of 13 technology-intensive SMEs in forestry sector was conducted. The forestry sector in Finland was chosen as a target context, there were many innovative pioneering SMEs operating in the industry and because the sector was going through significant changes. Findings - Three multi-firm collaboration modes in the commercialization phase were identified: networks with a lead partner, equal partnership, and partnership for external technology commercialization. The study shows that in SMEs, open innovation is used for commercialization rather than research and development. The main conclusion of the study is that the mode of collaboration in commercialization is determined by the core competence of the firm and the strategy for open innovation. Practical implications - The study results imply that SMEs benefit from opening up their innovation process in the commercialization phase. The firms in this study employed a blend of strategies that capitalized on their internal strengths. They collaborated actively with external firms and outsourced from specialists. This way they were able to compensate for their internal weaknesses and gain competitive advantage. Originality/value - The study extends our understanding of open innovation by providing a detailed analysis of how open innovation takes place in the commercialization phase of innovation process. Also, the study extends understanding of the strategic use of open innovation in SMEs by showing how SMEs balance the risk of losing their competitive advantage built on innovation and the benefit of creating a broader competence base with partnerships.;3;Business;Ref363;Q2;2017
The mainstream literature on innovation management has recognised that most organisations can and must innovate using both internal and external knowledge sources. The management of knowledge in multinational companies (MNCs) implies that subsidiaries should achieve centrality because they are in the unique position to tap into many different sources of knowledge from different cultural contexts. In this context, this paper aims to highlight the importance of 'openness' at the subsidiary level, combining both external and internal knowledge (within the MNC but outside the subsidiary). To do so, we test the single and joint effects of external and internal 'openness' on subsidiaries' innovation performance. Using Amadeus databases, 163 subsidiaries were selected and data were collected through a standardised questionnaire. Then, three hypotheses were tested through an OLS regression model. The results indicate that external and internal knowledge openness positively affects subsidiaries' innovation performance. Moreover, the inclusion of the interaction term shows that a high level of both leads to a multiplicative and positive effect. The findings are discussed in the light of the extant literature, and several implications for future research and MNC and subsidiary managers are highlighted.;3;Business;Ref364;Q1;2017
Public sector innovation is an important issue in the agenda of policymakers and academics but there is a need for a change of perspective, one that promotes a more open model of innovating, which takes advantage of the possibilities offered by collaboration between citizens, entrepreneurs and civil society as well as of new emerging technologies. Living labs are environments that can support public open innovation processes. This article makes a practical contribution to understand the role of living labs as intermediaries of public open innovation. The analysis focuses on the dynamics of these innovation intermediaries, their outcomes, and their main challenges. In particular, it adopts a qualitative approach (fourteen semi-structured interviews and one focus group were conducted) in order to analyze two living labs: Citilab in the city of Cornelia and the network of fab athenaeums (public fab labs) in the city of Barcelona, both in Spain. After a thorough analysis of the attributes of these living labs, the article concludes that 1) living labs provide the opportunity for public agencies to meet with private sector organizations and thus function as innovation intermediaries, 2) implementing an open innovation perspective is considered more important than obtaining specific innovation results, and 3) scalability and sustainability are the main problems living labs encounter as open innovation intermediaries.

Government transparency and information disclosure have received increasing attention from both academics and practitioners with the development of information technologies (Hs) and the Internet. Moreover, the popularity of social media applications has provided governments, especially governments in China and other developing countries, with new opportunities and challenges associated with the administrative shift toward open innovation. The official document exchange via microblogging (ODEM) of the Haining Bureau of Justice is a practical case of government open innovation in the social media context. Based on the ODEM case, this study uses the technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework to explore the factors that drive open innovation in China. We find that the support of top managers, the access and competence of IT personnel, and the regional economic and social environments are key determinants of the emergence of open innovation in the public sector.

This paper examines the dynamics of entrepreneurial acquisitions undertaken by UK high growth small and medium enterprises (SMEs). While entrepreneurial acquisitions are increasingly deployed by SMEs, little is known about their antecedents, motivational drivers and organisational outcomes. Drawing on detailed case study evidence from Scotland, the key factor found to be driving these acquisitions was the desire to augment and exploit technological complementarities between the acquiring and acquired firms. Acquisition can therefore be conceptualised as an advanced stage of the outside-in 'open innovation' strategies proactively used within these innovative SMEs. Firms executing this strategy typically have an acute propensity for risk, a desire for close customer engagement, effective business models and strong external orientation. The work suggests that greater attention should be paid within M&A theory to the dynamics of these types of smaller scale entrepreneurial acquisitions.;3;Business;Ref367;Q1;2017
This paper considers the open innovation paradigm in the context of entrepreneurial firms. Based on an analysis of survey data, it examines the relationship between network ties and innovation. These are considered as the strategic network ties associated with open innovation and the embedded ties associated with entrepreneurial networks. It is found that both strategic and embedded ties are significantly associated with rates of innovation for entrepreneurial firms, although for the former this relationship is driven by a minority of larger or highly innovative firms. Strategic ties are most strongly linked to product and organisational innovations, whilst process innovations are more related to embedded network ties. There is some evidence of complementarity between the two forms of network tie. It is concluded that in the entrepreneurial context, the open innovation concept should be broadened to encompass the role performed by embedded network ties.;3;Business;Ref368;Q1;2017
Interest in open innovation (OI) as a field of research has grown exponentially since the phrase was coined by Chesbrough in his 2003 book, with numerous articles, special issues, books, and conference sessions. Various reviews of the literature have summarized prior work, offered new frameworks, and identified opportunities for future research. Here we summarize these opportunities, which include more research on outbound OI, the role of open innovation in services, and network forms of collaboration such as consortia, communities, ecosystems, and platforms. Research should also examine the use of OI by small, new, and not-for-profit organizations, as well as the linkage of individual actions and motivations to open innovation. Other opportunities include better measuring the costs, benefits, antecedents, mediators and moderators of the effects of OI on performance, and understanding why and how OI is rejected, abandoned, or fails. Finally, we consider how OI can be better linked to prior theoretical research, including topics such as absorptive capacity, user innovation, resources, dynamic capabilities, business models, and the definition of the firm.;3;Business;Ref369;Q1;2017
Purpose - This paper explores openness within new product development (NPD) projects. The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of breadth, depth and partner newness on product innovativeness and product competitive advantage. The authors also seek to examine the contingent effects of the appropriability regime. The authors make suggestions to academics and practitioners based on the findings. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a structured survey instrument producing an empirical analysis of 205 NPD projects in the manufacturing sector in the UK. The authors use an ordinary least squares regression model to test hypothesised relationships between openness (breadth, depth and partner newness), product innovativeness, product competitive advantage and the appropriability regime. Findings - The authors find that each of the three dimensions of openness, depth, breadth and partner newness, have a significant but differing impact on product innovativeness. Specifically, the study indicates that breadth has a positive effect but only in the presence of a strong appropriability regime, partner newness has a direct positive effect, and depth a direct negative effect. The authors also find that product innovativeness has a positive impact on product competitive advantage. Research limitations/implications - Further research should focus on replicating the findings in other countries, search for further moderating factors, such as the stage of the NPD process, and analyse the longitudinal impact of openness within NPD projects. Practical implications - Organisations are encouraging managers to be more open in their approach to NPD. The authors' findings suggest that managers need to think about the three dimensions of openness, breadth, depth and partner newness. Their engagement with each of these dimensions depends on the desired outcomes of the innovation project and the strength of patents. Originality/value - The research extends the extant supplier involvement in new product development literature to examine the effect of up to 11 types of external actor in NPD projects. The authors test a new multi-dimensional measurement scale for the openness construct. The authors show that each dimension has a different relationship with product innovativeness.;3;Business;Ref370;Q1;2017
Although research on open innovation practices in larger and smaller organisations has been growing for over a decade, there has been limited evidence on the topic related to new and candidate members of the European Union. Existing studies of open innovation have predominantly focused on the examination of the phenomenon in companies from the most developed European countries (i.e. EU15). In this research, we examine how absorptive capacity and open innovation interact to impact innovation performance, based on a large dataset of companies operating in Slovenia. We contribute to the literature on open innovation by showing how an organisation's capacity for open innovation can be used to its full potential in order to impact the firm's performance.;3;Business;Ref371;Q3;2017
Purpose - This paper aims to provide a substantial overview of features and channels of knowledge and technology transfer in light of achieving impact from science and research. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is conceptual with substantial desk research undertaken. A taxonomy of transfer channels is proved and levels of impact from STI proposed. Findings - It is found that there are different levels of value generated from science, technology and innovation, each featuring different stakeholders with different agendas and expectations. It is argued that to make knowledge and technology transfer impactful and sustainable, a long-term and holistic view and approach is required. Originality/value - Against most papers about technology and knowledge transfer, this work presents an overarching overview of objects, channels and features of partners involved in transfer. It is features technology and knowledge transfer from a holistic perspective and provides useful background for future empiric studies and impact assessments.;13;Information;Ref372;Q1;2017
"Purpose - This study aims to shed light on the internal and external antecedents of open innovation (OI) in the context of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), with a special focus on the role of knowledge management (KM) capability. The paper develops and tests an integrative research model which assesses the effect of internal factors on KM capability; the impact of organizational and external factors, namely, KM capability and environmental dynamism, on OI; and whether environmental dynamism moderates the relationship between KM capability and OI. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the knowledge-based view and the social exchange and the contingency theories, this paper develops an integrative research model which analyzes several relations between organizational antecedents of KM capability and its effect on OI by using covariance-based structural equation modeling on a data set of Spanish SMEs. Findings - Results confirm that information technology-supported operations and commitment-based human resource practices have a positive and significant influence on KM capability. In contrast, results do not find support for the relationship between interdepartmental connectedness and KM capability, whereas both KM capability and environmental dynamism have a direct influence on OI. Originality/value - This paper adds to existing research on OI, as it is the first study that addresses the critical role of KM capability for the implementation of OI.";13;Information;Ref373;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of open innovation, especially focusing on technological M&A, on subsequent innovation and changes to the firm's core technological portfolio. Design/methodology/approach - The study suggests three types of core technological areas, based on prior focus and experience in technological categories. These are 1) the existing core area, in which the acquirer firm retains its knowledge and expertise, 2) the enhanced core area, where knowledge and expertise in the acquirer firm's insufficient areas are strengthened, and 3) the new core area, i.e. new knowledge fields in which the acquirer firm ventures into. The study then analyzes the effects of two key knowledge characteristics of the target firm, similarity and complementarity, on post-M&A innovation outcomes in each of the three core technological areas. Findings - The results confirm that while none of the investigated knowledge characteristics of the target firm is advantageous for post-M&A innovation outcomes in existing core areas, similarity of the target firm does facilitate post-M&A innovation outcomes in enhanced core areas. Moreover, the results confirm that complementarity of the target firm is beneficial for post-M&A innovation outcomes in new core areas. Originality/value - The study explains the reconfiguration mechanism of a firm's core technological portfolio. It also suggests an extended framework to analyze innovation outcomes in more detail. Moreover, the study helps to explain why most M&As result in failure.;13;Information;Ref374;Q1;2017
"Purpose - As firms turn their innovation activities toward collaborating with external partners, they face additional challenges in managing their knowledge. While different modes of intellectual property right regimes are applied in closed innovation systems, there seems to be tension between the concepts of ""open innovation"" and ""intellectual property rights"". The purpose of this paper is to investigate how firms best manage knowledge via intellectual property rights in open innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach - Following a mixed methods approach, the authors review relevant literature at the intersection of knowledge management, intellectual property rights, strategic management of intellectual property rights and the open innovation process. The authors identify success drivers through the lenses of - but not limited to - intellectual property rights and classify them in five distinct groups. Expending the view on open innovation beyond its modus operandi, the authors develop the Open Innovation Life Cycle, covering three stages and three levels of the open innovation process. The authors apply their findings to a case study in the pharmaceutical industry. Findings - The authors provide four key contributions. First, existing literature yields inconclusive results concerning the enabling or disabling function of intellectual property rights in open innovation processes, but the majority of scholars detect an ambivalent relation. Second, they identify and classify success drivers of successful knowledge management via intellectual property rights in open innovation processes. Third, they advance literature on open innovation beyond its modus operandi to include three stages and three levels. Fourth, they test their findings to a case study and show how management leverages knowledge by properly using intellectual property rights in open innovation. Practical implications - The findings support firms in managing knowledge via intellectual property rights in open innovation processes. Management should account for the peculiarities of open innovation preparation and open innovation termination to prevent unintentional knowledge drain. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies to view open innovation as a process beyond its modus operandi by considering the preparations for and termination of open innovation activities. It also addresses the levels involved in managing knowledge via intellectual property rights in open innovation from individual (personal) to project and firm level.";13;Information;Ref375;Q1;2017
Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the role of design as a knowledge translation mechanism in R&D-oriented open innovation. In particular, the paper intends to look at how design can be used as a means of knowledge transfer among various stakeholders who speak different languages and have divergent needs and interests in a process where knowledge openly flew across the boundaries of a high number of organizations. Design/methodology/approach - The paper combines the insights from theory with the empirical evidences gathered by adopting an extreme case study approach: the detailed analysis of a case study related to an R&D project funded by the European Commission and aimed to investigate and produce innovative serious games in the area of healthcare. The project gathered a large number of stakeholders and deliberately adopted design to support an open innovation approach. Findings - The paper provides insights into the use of design outputs such as artifacts, sketches, visual representations or prototypes to translate ideas, theoretical and technical requirements, documents and outputs into formats that can be more easily understood and appreciated by various stakeholders. This supports and favors coordination in open innovation projects where many different stakeholders are engaged in. Research limitations/implications - Although the adoption of an extreme case study approach offers important implications to understand the role of design in R&D-oriented open innovation, the use of a single case study represents the basis both to explore hypothesis and to provide first evidences that need to be further tested with other qualitative and quantitative analysis. Practical implications - The paper offers practical implications about how design can help individuals and organizations involved in R&D activities to better communicate and share knowledge among various stakeholders by aligning their different needs, interests and languages along the various phases of their project development. Originality/value - The originality of the paper lays at the intersection of three different fields: open innovation, knowledge management and design for innovation, thus integrating mature, but so far isolated, research streams. It provides insights for theory building by explaining the use of design as knowledge translational mechanism as well as it informs the practice by highlighting the power of design as a mean to support knowledge flows into open innovation-based R&D projects.;13;Information;Ref376;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to extend the knowledge into the relationship between open innovation (OI) and firm's innovative performance. Specifically, the authors aim to determine whether the benefits of OI practices are different for Food and Beverage (FnB) firms as compared to those of other sectors. The FnB industry is relevant in terms of employment GDP generation in the UE, characterised by high integration and low-tech intensity. Design/methodology/approach - In order to achieve the goal and obtain robust results, the authors consider four OI dimensions and four innovation performance measures using panel data (2004-2011) from 10,771 FnB and non-FnB firms using Tobit and Logit models by random effects. Findings - The authors test and confirm the presence of the classical inverted U-shape relationship between OI and firm innovative performance for FnB and non-FnB companies. However, the optimal number of external sources of knowledge used is lesser for FnB than the rest of the companies. Originality/value - The paper compares the OI effects in a traditional and low-tech industry vs other industries considering four innovation outputs (product innovations, process innovations, incremental innovation and radical innovation).;3;Business;Ref377;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate firms' motives to patent in general, and more specifically how some of these motives depend upon firms' technology strategies and especially their level of open innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a questionnaire survey sent to chief technology officers (or equivalent) of the largest R&D spenders among Swedish large firms (e.g. ABB, AstraZeneca, Ericsson, and Volvo) and among Swedish small and medium-sized enterprises. Principal component analysis and multiple linear regressions were used to check the impact from open innovation upon the importance of 21 different motives to patent, with a specific focus on protection and bargaining related motives. Findings - The most important motive to patent is to protect product technologies, but protecting freedom to operate is almost as important, followed by a number of other motives. Increasing importance of open innovation in firms is related to stronger bargaining motives to patent, and even stronger protection motives. In fact, when comparing with closed innovation, the results show that open innovation is more strongly positively related with all different motives to patent except for one (to attract customers). This indicates that firms find it more important to patent when engaged in open innovation than when engaged in closed innovation. Originality/value - The paper reports results from the first study that links patenting motives to technology strategies. It contributes to an emerging stream of empirical studies investigating the role of patents in external technology strategies and open innovation, showing that the motives to patent are strengthened within open innovation settings.;3;Business;Ref378;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between open innovation and the use of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in small-and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The authors consider patents, industrial designs (i.e. design patents in the USA), trademarks, and copyrights. Design/methodology/approach - The relationships between open innovation, IPRs, and profitability are tested with random-effects panel regressions on data from the Spanish Community Innovation Survey for 2,873 firms spanning the years 2008-2013. Findings - A key result is that SMEs do not benefit from open innovation or from patenting in the same way as larger firms. Furthermore, the results show that SMEs profit in different ways from IPR, depending on their size and the corresponding IPR. Research limitations/implications - The different impact of IPRs on the efficiency of open innovation in firms of varying sizes highlights the importance of further investigation into IP strategies and into open innovation in SMEs. Practical implications - Industrial designs are currently the most efficient IPR for SMEs to protect their intellectual property in open innovation collaborations. Depending on the company size, the use of different IPRs is recommended. Moreover, firms should seek to increase the efficiency of open innovation and the use of IPRs. Social implications - The high impact of SMEs on employment highlights the importance of fomenting efficient innovation processes in such firms. Originality/value - This paper opens the black box of IPR in relation to open innovation in SMEs, and draws distinctive conclusions with regards to patents, industrial designs, trademarks, and copyrights.;3;Business;Ref379;Q1;2017
The future of open innovation will be more extensive, more collaborative, and more engaged with a wider variety of participants. It will extend beyond technology to business models, and it will embrace both product and service innovation. Just as no man is an island, no firm that restricts itself to the confines of its own R&D lab will survive in an open innovation world.;3;Business;Ref380;Q1;2017

Purpose - This research paper aims to examine how open innovation (OI) intermediaries facilitate knowledge collaboration between organizations and online user communities. Drawing on a Community of Practice (CoP) perspective on knowledge, the study lays out a framework of the knowledge boundary management mechanisms (and associated practices) that intermediaries deploy in enabling client organizations to engage in online community-based OI. Design/methodology/approach - This research is based on an exploratory case study of an OI intermediary and 18 client organizations that engage with online user communities on the intermediary's platform. Results incorporate both the intermediary and clients' perspective, based on analysis of intermediary and client interviews, clients' online community projects and other archival data. Findings - Results reveal that OI intermediaries deploy three knowledge boundary management mechanisms - syntactic, semantic and pragmatic - each underpinned by a set of practices. Together, these mechanisms enable knowledge transfer, translation and transformation, respectively, and thus lead to cumulatively richer knowledge collaboration outcomes at the organization-community boundary. The findings show that the pragmatic mechanism reinforces both semantic and syntactic mechanisms, and is hence the most critical to achieving effective knowledge collaboration in community-based OI settings. Practical implications - The findings suggest that OI intermediaries have to implement all three boundary management mechanisms to successfully enable knowledge collaboration for community-based OI. More specifically, intermediaries need to expand their focus beyond the development of digital platforms, to include nuanced efforts at building organizational commitment to community engagement. Originality/value - Drawing on the CoP view, this study integrates the knowledge management literature into the OI literature to conceptualize the role of OI intermediaries in shaping knowledge collaboration between organizations and communities. In engaging with the interactive nature of knowledge exchange in such multi-actor settings, this research extends the firm-centric theorization of knowledge that currently dominates the existing OI research.;13;Information;Ref382;Q1;2017
Purpose - The paper aims to understand how individuals differ in individual absorptive capacity - their ability to recognize, assimilate, transform and exploit external knowledge. These individual absorptive capacities are a key knowledge management building block for an organization's open innovation practices. The study examines individual antecedents - human capital, social capital and cognition and innovation outcomes of individual absorptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach - This is a quantitative study of 147 employees in a single medium-sized Dutch industrial firm. Based on a survey and structural equation modeling, the antecedents' prior knowledge diversity, network diversity and cognitive style are examined in relation to individual absorptive capacity. Further, the mediating effects of individual absorptive capacity on its antecedents and innovation outcome are investigated. Findings - The main findings are that prior knowledge diversity, external network diversity and a bisociative cognitive style explain differences in individual absorptive capacity. A bisociative cognitive style appears to be the most important factor. Also, this study finds that individual absorptive capacity mediates between its antecedents and individual innovation performance and is therefore a relevant factor to capture value from external knowledge sources. Research limitations/implications - The study extends open innovation theory by exploring individual-level factors that explain the ability to capture value from external knowledge. It suggests that differences in open innovation practices are explained by heterogeneity at the individual level. Further, it explains how individuals' potentials for open innovation are mediated by their absorptive capacities. These insights enable future researchers to further examine individual-level factors in knowledge management practices and to explore cross-level individual-organizational interactions for open innovation. Practical implications - This paper highlights that individuals' engagements in open innovation practices are explained not only by individuals' motivations but also by their abilities to absorb external knowledge. Further, it helps managers to design knowledge management practices to promote employees' absorptive capacities, to improve open innovation processes. Originality/value - This study investigates the neglected individual-level factors of open innovation practices from a micro-foundational and knowledge management perspective. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to examine individual-level antecedents and outcomes of individual absorptive capacity.;13;Information;Ref383;Q1;2017
"Purpose - The aim of this paper is to develop the conceptual design of an information and communication technologies (ICT) platform supporting the inbound open innovation (OI) process within the technological developments business unit of Leonardo Defence Systems. Design/methodology/approach - After a preliminary phase concerning the context analysis, methodology includes three main steps: conceptualization of functions; preliminary design; and conceptual design of the system/SW architecture. In each of these phases, the authors tried to merge evidence from the scientific literature with empirical insight emerging from the field. Findings - Results report the conceptual design proposal for an integrated ICT platform supporting the OI. It includes the conceptualization of main functions, the preliminary design deriving from use cases and the proposal for the overall system architecture and data model. Research limitations/implications - The research focuses only on the conceptual design phase; at this stage, the platform has not been still implemented or tested. Also, generalizability concerns may arise from the single-application context. Practical implications - The outcoming conceptual design can be useful for firms that open their boundaries to external partners, as well as for software developers which could draw on it. Firms approaching similar OI challenges can re-contextualize the platform to their own setting. Originality/value - Originality of this research relies on the attempt to show how ICT can support firms in their OI processes and, secondly, to support firms aiming to create a positive environment that encourages people at leveraging existing external technological opportunities and sources of knowledge. In so doing, a systematic design approach to the definition of the conceptual proposal is also pursued.";13;Information;Ref384;Q1;2017
Purpose - This paper aims to shed light on how family firms execute open innovation strategies by managing internal and external knowledge flows. Design/methodology/approach - First, through a comprehensive literature review, the paper identifies the barriers to the acquisition and transfer of knowledge in open innovation processes. Second, it presents and discusses the results of an exploratory case study on Loccioni, an Italian family firm providing high-tech measurement solutions, highlighting how this family firm managed to overcome the barriers in executing an open innovation strategy. Findings - The case study shows that Loccioni faced specific challenges in acquiring and transferring knowledge in its open innovation processes and developed two idiosyncratic capabilities - labelled imprinting and fraternization - that helped the firm overcome the barriers to knowledge acquisition and transfer. The analysis shows that these two capabilities are enabled by the distinctive goals and social capital characterizing family firms. Originality/value - The paper creates a link between open innovation and family business research with an empirically grounded model illustrating how the idiosyncratic capabilities of a family firm help overcome the critical barriers to the acquisition and transfer of knowledge in executing an open innovation strategy.;13;Information;Ref385;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how subnational institutions within a country explain the performance consequences of open innovation (OI) in emerging market enterprises (EMEs). Design/methodology/approach - The paper conducts a regression analysis by using a novel panel data set comprising of 438 innovative Chinese firms over the period of 2008-2011. Findings - The authors show that although on average openness to external actors improves innovation performance this effect is pronounced for EMEs that operate in subnational regions with a higher level of intellectual property rights (IPR) enforcement and of factor market development. The findings point to the context-dependent nature of OI strategy and the complementary effect of institutional parameters in emerging markets and help to reconcile the contrasting findings regarding the effect of OI in the prior literature. Originality/value - This paper extends the literature on OI by suggesting that the analysis of the performance consequences of OI strategy should go beyond the nexus between OI and firm performance, and instead, focus on subnational-specific institutions, such as region-specific IPR enforcement, factor market development and intermediation market development, that may facilitate or constrain the effect of OI model.;3;Business;Ref386;Q1;2017
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to test the effect of internal and external collaboration on the degree of newness (incremental/radical) in innovation projects. This adds to the understanding of the particular patterns of open innovation (OI) and what characterizes the innovation emerging through this approach. Design/methodology/approach - Tests are performed on the effect of internal and external collaboration on the degree of newness (incremental/radical) in innovation projects. This adds to the understanding of the particular patterns of OI and what characterizes the innovation emerging through this approach. The empirical analysis is based on a data set including responses from 512 Danish engineers. Findings - The results show that external collaboration has significantly different effects on the degree of newness depending on the type of external partners involved, and they also show that radical innovation output is positively related to involving the R&D department (internal) and universities (external involvement) and negatively related to involving suppliers. Originality/value - The results provide a more detailed understanding of how different OI patterns affect the development of incremental vs radical innovation in existing organizations. In particular, three findings add new insights into how OI affects innovation to reach the highest degree of newness: high importance of collaboration with external partners with distinct interests and skills; low reliance on existing customers and suppliers for the development of radical innovation; and narrow and focused internal involvement rather than broad internal involvement.";3;Business;Ref387;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the influence that adopting open innovation (OI) has on the innovativeness and performance of specialized small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper also examines the adoption of OI within a firm's practices and models, and within the three dimensions of firm sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - Survey data from 48 specialized SMEs manufacturing supercars were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. SmartPLS software was used to conduct a path analysis and test the proposed framework. Findings - The findings suggest that high adoption of OI models tends to increase firm innovativeness. Similarly, the adoption of OI practices has a positive effect on innovativeness but to a lesser extent than OI models. The moderation results of innovativeness further show that OI models and practices can benefit the performance of SMEs. Specifically, two dimensions of performance - environmental and social performance - were found to be greatly influenced by OI. Research limitations/implications - Due to parsimony in the investigated model, this study only focuses on OI adoption as practices and models without considering its drivers or other contingency factors. Practical implications - This paper could help practitioners in SMEs better understand the benefits of adopting OI to be more innovative but also more sustainable. Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature on the role of OI practices and models regarding the dimensions of firm sustainability performance by being the first paper to investigate this relationship in the context of small and medium manufacturers of supercars.;3;Business;Ref388;Q1;2017
Purpose - This work provides new insights into possible managerial choices and development directions for practising open innovation (OI) in companies. The purpose of this paper is to explore the different practices, actors and tools adopted for opening up the innovation process, in particular, by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are still facing difficulties in its implementation. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a literature review and an exploratory survey of a sample of 85 European SMEs. Findings - The study identifies a total of 23 practices, 20 actors and 11 tools involved in the OI processes of companies. It highlights, through literature and empirical evidence, how different combinations of practices, actors and tools are put into practice. Research limitations/implications - The developed framework offers new insights both from OI literature and from practitioners' point of view into the supporting decision-making processes regarding which practices to implement, tools to adopt and actors to collaborate with. A wider investigation is recommended to include more variables to define the differences among the combinations of practices, actors and tools in terms of types of innovation (e.g. product, process, etc.), the openness degree and other contextual factors. Originality/value - The originality of this paper is based on the fact that it focusses on a practical perspective of OI implementation, building a framework of reference from previous literature and empirical investigation.;3;Business;Ref389;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to verify and improve the framework assessing the evolution and importance of the technological, human, social and financial resources of an Indian research-based spin-off (RBSO) throughout its four stages of development by Vohora et al. (2004). Design/methodology/approach - The open innovation (OI) phenomenon is spreading among public organizations. One of the OI practices used by the public research centers to market their technologies is to set up new business entities called RBSOs. Many studies have focused on spin-offs but there are still some gaps. To overcome the existing limitations, the authors built a framework which they tested on three previous case studies. Findings - The results obtained show how a parent organization and its incubator can play fundamental roles in creating and developing a successful RBSO. This is done by supplying managerial staff and providing access to skills, funds and other material and immaterial resources. Research limitations/implications - The limitations of this study are related to the sectoral and geopolitical factors of the single case analyzed. For this reason, the observations that emerge should be supported by other empirical analyses. Originality/value - The findings of this study can offer a better understanding of the spin-off life to managers, researchers, public organizations and government agencies. They can learn how to improve policies and practices of technology transfer and strengthen the national industrial system.;3;Business;Ref390;Q1;2017
The concepts of open innovation and big data have been largely explored, but little research focused on the use of big data for open innovation activities. We explore how big data obtained by social media can be useful for open innovation activities in Television (TV) domain. Results demonstrate that the analysis of open data coming from social media data allows TV managers to identify the specific TV contents and Twitter elements, which are able to increase the social media traffic related to the show and gain insights for innovating the design of the TV show's episodes or seasons.;5;Computer;Ref391;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a patent-based framework for investigating the effect of previous and current open innovation (OI) adoption on firms' knowledge management strategies and type of innovation output. Design/methodology/approach - Patent data are employed for gauging innovation practices, exploitation vs exploration strategies, specialization vs diversification choices and type of innovation. The study is performed on a sample of 1,280 patents granted to 66 top R&D spending bio-pharmaceutical companies. The year of analysis is 2010. Findings - The previous recourse to specific innovation practices influences the current practice selection. R&D collaboration, outsourcing and mergers and acquisitions are employed to pursue exploration. Past purchase of patents increases the likelihood to achieve architectural and radical innovation in current activities. Research limitations/implications - The work recommends the use of patent data to gauge many key elements for knowledge and innovation management. Results exhort scholars to investigate innovation practices at the knowledge domain level in order to detect specific behaviors. Practical implications - The study provides a methodology for supporting decision-makers in assessing firms' OI adoption, also performing the benchmark with competitors and R&D partners. Given the high computational effort required for applying the methodology, the authors are planning to give access to the software specifically developed for this study. Originality/value - The work contributes to the current debate considering the effect of a combination of innovation practices on knowledge management strategies and type of innovation output, with a particular focus on OI activities. Moreover, the separation between the impact of previous and current innovation practices provides useful insights.;3;Business;Ref392;Q1;2017
Purpose - This paper aims to investigate three key factors (i.e. cognitive dimensions, the knowledge-driven approach and absorptive capacity) that are likely to determine the preference for informal inbound open innovation (OI) modes, through the lens of the OI model and knowledge-based view (KBV). The innovation literature has differentiated these collaborations into informal inbound OI entry modes and formal inbound OI modes, offering an advocative and conceptual view. However, empirical studies on these collaborations are still limited. Design/methodology/approach - Building on the above-mentioned theoretical framework, the empirical research was performed in two stages. First, data were collected via a closed-ended questionnaire distributed to all the participants from the sample by e-mail. Second, to assess the hypotheses, structural equation modelling (SEM) via IBM (R) SPSS (R) Amos 20 was applied. Findings - The empirical research was conducted on 175 small to medium enterprises in the United Kingdom, suggesting that the knowledge-driven approach is the strongest determinant, leading to a preference for informal inbound OI modes. The findings were obtained using SEM and are discussed in line with the theoretical framework. Research limitations/implications - Owing to the chosen context and sector of the empirical analysis, the research results may lack generalisability. Hence, new studies are proposed. Practical implications - The paper includes implications for the development of informal inbound OI led by knowledge-driven approach. Originality/value - This paper offers an empirical research to investigate knowledge-driven preferences in informal inbound OI modes.;13;Information;Ref393;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore organizational factors that act as antecedents of open innovation search. The authors aim to empirically examine whether the extent to which the organizational slack is absorbed determines its influence on firms' openness in innovation search. In addition, the authors also examine the moderating effect of absorptive capacity on the relationship between slack and open innovation search. Design/methodology/approach - This study adopted secondary data from multiple sources (NBER, Compustat and US census) and then constructed a ten-year balanced panel dataset of 298 manufacturers. The generalized least square method was used to explore the determinants of open innovation search among manufacturing firms. Findings - The results of this study reveal that the absorption level of organizational slack indeed determines the openness in innovation search. Specifically, absorbed slack negatively affects a firm's openness in innovation search, whereas unabsorbed slack promotes open innovation search. Additionally, the relationship between absorbed slack and open innovation search will be less negative with the increase of absorptive capacity. Originality/value - Different from most previous studies that have examined the performance effect of open search among high-tech and large enterprises, this study focuses on the antecedents of open search strategy in both high-and low-tech, large and small firms. The findings reveal that different forms of organizational slack divergently influence a firm's open search strategy, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between organizational slack and knowledge search behavior in a broader context, as well as the understanding of the moderating effect of absorptive capacity.;13;Information;Ref394;Q1;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how knowledge search (KS) affects open innovation performance (OIP) in consideration of appropriability hazard in an emerging market context. Design/methodology/approach - The authors identify two types of appropriability hazard related to KS activities in the improvement of OIP: partner-related and market-related hazards, and construct a model of KS to the OIP with the government-enterprise relationship and market focus (MF) as moderating factors of the analysis framework, using the hierarchical regression analysis based on a survey sample of 258 Chinese companies. Findings - The authors find that KS has a stronger positive relationship with OIP in international market-focused enterprises compared with domestic market-focused enterprises. In addition, using a configuration approach, the authors find that KS is more positively related to OIP when enterprises have an international MF and a good relationship with the government, but less in other MF government and enterprises relationship configurations. Originality/value - This paper contributes to previous research work by identifying two types of appropriability hazard related to KS activities in emerging market countries: partner-related and market-related hazards. The authors argue that a positive relationship between KS and OIP is more likely to occur if these appropriability hazards can be mitigated by export MF and a good relationship with the government which has not been demonstrated in previous research.;3;Business;Ref395;Q1;2017
Open innovation has transformed internal novel resource allocation and facilitated diverse interorganizational cooperation models. Previous studies have investigated open innovation archetypes and their formation. However, most researchers have neglected the crucial role that team leaders play in integrating internal and external resources and connecting creative ideas in open innovation. This study investigated the influence of open innovation archetypes and team leaders' innovation traits on team performance. On the basis of the literature review, the analytical hierarchy process was applied to construct a framework for assessing and selecting team leaders in open innovation. The analysis was completed based on samples from 45 valid respondents (88% return rate) in Taiwan's high-tech industry. The study results suggested that innovation knowledge is the most crucial innovation criterion for a leader, particularly core knowledge and advanced knowledge. Among the various sub-criteria, extrinsic motivation was the second most important sub-criterion. Leaders with strong innovation motivations are suitable to lead inbound open innovation projects.;8;Engineering;Ref396;Q2;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine what strategies the CEOs of research and development (R&D) intensive small/medium enterprises (SMEs) in the life sciences sector carry out in regard to open innovation (OI), as R&D costs continue to rise, placing pressure on innovation managers. Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative study was carried out, consisting of 30 semi-structured interviews with CEOs of small R&D intensive SMEs in the life sciences sector. The authors analysed the key factors identified by the CEOs in relation to their OI strategies. Findings - SMEs adopt a range of OI strategies and collaborations, subject to certain conditions. A multilevel mapping developed from the analysis connects actors to the wider domain, setting the outcomes of the research in context. Research limitations/implications - This qualitative study provides detailed understandings that could provide the basis for a wider quantitative study that would provide greater coverage of the sector, thus reinforcing the outcomes. Practical implications - The study will be relevant to practising CEOs who are considering the range of options offered by OI. Originality/value - While large firms are adopting OI strategies, less is known about the OI strategies developed in SMEs. The study addresses that gap. The life sciences context is also novel.;3;Business;Ref397;Q2;2017
Purpose - This study aims to use expectation disconfirmation theory (EDT) to investigate how an organization's satisfaction with its supply network's behavior influences its intention to open innovation with that network. This paper proposes that an organization's orientation to open innovation is influenced by confirmation of previously held expectations of trust and commitment and level of perceived procedural justice in its open innovation partner. This paper also examines the effect of this orientation on the organization's supply chain competence. Design/methodology/approach - Using data from a survey of 286 European firms, the study proposes and evaluates a structural equation model. Findings - The results show that a positive disconfirmation of trust (where perceived trust exceeds expectations) plays a crucial role in shaping organizations' intentions to continue open innovation with their supply networks. These results show that disconfirmation is a good predictor of overall satisfaction with open innovation. This paper also confirms the positive effect of orientation to open innovation on supply chain competence. Finally, this paper obtained evidence for the positive effect of supply chain competence on firm performance. Originality/value - This study shows the importance of managing expectations in open innovation under the EDT. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous research has analyzed the consistency between the trust and commitment an organization expects from its open innovation partner and the trust and commitment it ultimately perceives as a factor explaining its degree of orientation to open innovation. Therefore, this research contributes to a better understanding of open innovation enablers and also its consequences.;3;Business;Ref398;Q1;2017
"Motivated by the multiple 'success stories' of the open innovation paradigm in the private sector, and also by the increasing complexity of social problems and needs, the public sector has started moving in this direction, attempting to exploit the extensive knowledge of citizens for the development of innovations in public policies and services. As the direct transfer of open innovation methods from the private sector to the public sector is not possible, it is necessary to develop effective 'citizen-sourcing' methods, which address the specific needs of the public sector, and then analyze and evaluate them from various political and management sciences' perspectives. This paper makes a two-fold contribution in this direction: i) It evaluates a novel method of monitoring relevant social media (e.g. political blogs, news websites, and also Facebook, Twitter, etc. accounts) by government agencies, by retrieving and making advanced processing of their content, and extracting from it external knowledge about specific domains of government activity or public policies of interest, in order to promote and support open innovation; ii) For this purpose it develops a multi-perspective evaluation framework, based on sound theoretical foundations from the political and management sciences, which can be of wide applicability; it includes three evaluation perspectives: a political perspective (based on the 'wicked' social problems theory from the political sciences), a crowd-sourcing perspective (based on previous management sciences research on crowd sourcing) and a diffusion perspective (based on Roger's diffusion of innovation theory from management sciences). The above evaluation provides interesting insights into this novel method of promoting and supporting open innovation in the public sector through social media monitoring, revealing its capabilities and strengths, and at the same time its problems and weaknesses as well, and also ways/interventions for addressing the latter.

Purpose - In a world of ever-changing corporate environments and reduced product life cycles, most organizations cannot afford anymore to innovate on their own. Hence, they open their innovation processes to incorporate knowledge of external sources and to increase their innovation potential. As the shift toward open innovation (OI) is difficult and makes many initiatives fail, the question arises which capabilities organizations should develop to successfully implement OI. As the literature encompasses mature but isolated streams on OI capabilities, there is a need for an integrated capability framework. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes the open innovation capability framework (OICF) that compiles and structures capabilities relevant for implementing OI. The OICF covers the outside-in and coupled processes of OI. To integrate multiple streams of the OI literature, the OICF builds on a structured literature review. The OICF was also validated in a two-step review process with OI experts from academia and industry. Findings - The OICF comprises 23 capability areas grouped along the factors such as strategic alignment, governance, methods, information technology, people, and culture. To analyze the existing body of knowledge on OI capabilities, the authors compare the OICF with other OI-related capability frameworks and compile a heatmap based on the results of the literature review. The authors also discuss the experts' feedback on individual factors of the OICF as well as on interdependencies among these factors. Practical implications - The OICF provides practitioners with a structured overview of the capabilities to consider when implementing OI. Based on the OICF, practitioners can define the scope of their OI initiatives. They can use the OICF as a foundation for prioritizing, selecting, and operationalizing capability areas as well as for deriving implementation roadmaps. Originality/value - The OICF is the first framework to take a holistic perspective on OI capabilities. It integrates mature but isolated research streams of OI. It helps practitioners define the scope of OI initiatives and academics gain insights into the current state of the art on OI capabilities.;3;Business;Ref400;Q1;2017
Purpose - The literature has shown great interest in open innovation (OI), and also discussed its degree of openness based on, for example, the number of parties involved. Less is known, however, about what makes OI processes work. The purpose of this paper is to describe and discuss the importance of trust in OI, and the paper specifically focusses on a start-up company's OI processes with collaboration parties. The paper points out how a lack of trust antecedents may disable such OI processes. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical part of the paper consists of a case study on a medicine technology start-up. Interviews and analyses of secondary sources made up the main data capturing methods. Each collaboration between the start-up and another party is analysed through three trust antecedents: contractual, competence based, and goodwill. Findings - The paper shows how either party may have chosen to discontinue the collaboration, based on the lack of competence or goodwill antecedents to trust. Specifically, the case indicates how the start-up discontinues the collaboration based on a perceived lack of goodwill, while the collaboration party bases its decision on competence deficits by the start-up. Originality/value - The paper contributes to previous research through describing OI related to start-ups, and introducing trust antecedents as prerequisites for OI. To the literature on trust, trust mutuality makes a research contribution.;3;Business;Ref401;Q2;2017
"Purpose - Little is known, about the role played by start-ups in open innovation networks. Start-ups - due to their nature of new and emerging companies - can largely benefit from the knowledge that can flow intentionally or unintentionally from external partners during open innovation practices. When open innovation networks are not set among peers on both sides the authors expect to have more unintended knowledge flows. Such knowledge ""leaks"" - as the authors named them - in open innovation networks are totally unexplored in literature. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to focus ""whether and how knowledge leaks occur in open innovation networks with start-ups"". Design/methodology/approach - The research design of this study relies on social network analysis methods and techniques to disentangle the role of start-ups in open innovation networks - in a major Italian aerospace cluster - vis-a-vis the three types of knowledge considered in this study. Then the authors confirmed knowledge leaks to occur through a multiplexity analysis. In the second stage of the research, the authors decided to strengthen the results, making them more vivid and thorough, relying on four case studies. Findings - The paper sheds light on a totally unexplored phenomenon, theorizing on the role of start-ups in open innovation networks and suggesting intriguing implications both for theory and managers on whether and how knowledge leaks occur. Research limitations/implications - The main limitations arise from the specific research context, in fact the study has been conducted in an aerospace cluster. So future studies might consider to explore knowledge leaks in non-cluster settings and in low tech industries. Practical implications - The results have practical implications both for policy makers and for managers. First of all, the research confirms how open innovation often originates from a combination of different knowledge types acquired through the collaboration with heterogeneous players, start-ups included. Hence, managers may design open innovation strategies balancing their portfolio of collaborations to maximize the absorption of relevant knowledge and start-uppers may consider to engage in open innovation practices to accelerate knowledge absorption. Nevertheless, the study warns managers against the risk of knowledge leaks, especially in cases like start-ups where the eagerness to participate or the prestige associated with participating in open innovation networks with key players may hamper the control over knowledge leaks. Social implications - This opens up for possible interventions for policy makers too. First of all, policy makers may consider incorporating the concept of knowledge leaks in their campaign in favour of open innovation. Second, the study may help policy makers in designing programmes for knowledge transfer partnerships amongst the various players of a cluster in a more conscious way, especially warning new to business companies, like start-ups, about possible leaks. Finally, there is also the need of developing professional figures like consultants capable of supporting start-ups in their open innovation practices. Originality/value - Findings reported in the paper confirm multiplexity and heteromorphism in knowledge exchanges and shed the light on a completely unexplored field (i.e. open innovation and start-ups), focussing on knowledge leaks. Relevant implications for policy makers and managers are included in the study.";3;Business;Ref402;Q2;2017
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a methodological framework for evaluating the impact of open innovation (OI) adoption on start-up ventures at the knowledge domain level, taking into account the technological specialization and the quality of innovation output. Design/methodology/approach - The framework employs patent data for investigating joint development activities between start-ups and partners, thus defining an openness degree of R&D. The partner typology and the levels of specialization on the knowledge fields affected by each invention are investigated. The methodology is tested on a sample of bio-pharmaceutical start-ups. Findings - On average, the openness level in the start-up phase is higher than the consolidation one. Furthermore, the higher the level of openness during the start-up phase, the higher the propensity to collaborate with scientific organizations. And yet, the occurrence of R&D collaborations is positively correlated to the level of specialization on the knowledge fields involved in joint development activities. Practical implications - OI strategies are valuable for start-ups, particularly in the bio-pharmaceutical industry, since their adoption improves the quality of innovation output. This is particularly true when R&D collaborations are established with scientific entities. Originality/value - This work investigates the impact of OI adoption on start-up ventures at the knowledge domain level, by employing objective and standardized data. Hence, the methodology can be considered as a first step in developing a useful tool for managers, researchers and business analysts.;3;Business;Ref403;Q2;2017
Purpose - Open innovation in start-ups is a relatively unexplored field and studies focusing on collaborative innovation between start-ups with large companies seen from the former's point of view are virtually inexistent. The authors address this gap in an exploratory study built on in-depth case studies. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how start-ups successfully organize and manage open innovation with large companies. The paper highlights common challenges and barriers faced by start-ups in adopting open innovation practices along with its benefits for them. Design/methodology/approach - This is an exploratory study based on two case studies. The cases are diligently selected to examine two key forms of open innovation - inbound and outbound open innovation - in start-ups. Findings - The paper provides an insight on how start-ups organize and manage open innovation activities with large companies and how it benefits them in overcoming liability of newness and smallness. The practices significantly differ from those followed in large companies. The paper highlights the advantages and challenges of inbound and outbound open innovation for start-ups. This paper also ascertains the crucial role of start-up manager for successful implementation of open innovation and shows how start-up's managers with prior experience of working in/with a large company can proficiently deal with the larger counterpart in the innovation network. Research limitations/implications - This research is based on exploratory case studies so the conclusions drawn from these two cases may be hard to generalize. The findings of the study could be used for further development of the theoretical framework. Future research, including quantitative studies, will be helpful in examining the conclusions and providing more in-depth understanding of open innovation in start-ups. Practical implications - The paper includes several practical implications for the managers including the role start-up managers play in organizing and managing open innovation activities. Furthermore, this paper suggests how start-ups could orchestrate open innovation ecosystem. Originality/value - The paper is a step forward in filling the literature gap about open innovation and start-ups with some definite implications for start-up managers. A lot is written about the collaboration between large firms and start-ups from a former's point of view but the start-up's perspective has been left unexplored.;3;Business;Ref404;Q2;2017
This paper addresses the challenging problem of collaborative open innovation in the context of Virtual Enterprises. The illustrated solutions, which represent the outcome of the BIVEE European project, are based on a knowledge-centric approach and a business innovation reference framework characterised by flexible guidelines, capable of providing useful guidance without hindering freedom and creativity with tight engineering practice. Based on this a software platform has been developed and experimented in different industrial settings, providing very positive feedback.;5;Computer;Ref405;Q1;2017
The Orphan Drug Act (ODA) was an historic attempt to stimulate the development of drugs for rare diseases, intended to help bring to the market drugs for diseases that the pharmaceutical industry might otherwise not have had the financial incentives to pursue. While the intended effects of this regulatory stimulus on innovation are widely analyzed, the unintended ones remain unexplored. Thus, the objective of this paper is to analyze and conceptualize the impact of a relevant regulatory stimulus, such as the ODA, on the adoption of the open innovation paradigm in the pharmaceutical industry. Results show that the ODA made the adoption of this paradigm by large pharmaceutical companies possible, even if it partially inhibited its implementation. Finally, this study develops a framework characterizing the orphan drug development process in terms of drivers, activities, and actors. Future avenues for research are also suggested.;9;Environmental;Ref406;Q1;2016
Background: In spite of an increased interest in open innovation and strategies that call for an increased collaboration between different healthcare actors, there is a lack of open innovation research in public contexts. Objective: This article presents the results of a review regarding the healthcare sector's engagement in open innovation as well as constraining factors and positive outcomes of open innovation in healthcare. Method: The literature search focused on papers published in English between 2003 and 2014. Based on specified inclusion criteria, 18 articles were included. Results: Results reveal that most studies focus on inbound open innovation where external knowledge is integrated with the internal knowledge base at an initial phase of the innovation process. Innovation primarily results in products and services through innovation networks. We also identified constraining factors for open innovation in healthcare, including the complex organizations of healthcare, the need to establish routines for capturing knowledge from patients and clinicians, regulations and healthcare data laws as well as the positive outcome patient empowerment. Conclusion: The healthcare sector's engagement in open innovation is limited, and it is necessary to perform further research with a focus on how open innovation can be managed in healthcare.;12;Health;Ref407;Q2;2016
Sustainability and social media use in open innovation play important roles in a firm's new product development (NPD) process. This research examines, in conjunction, the roles of sustainability and social media driven inbound open innovation (SMOI) for a firm's NPD performance, and further, takes a more refined approach by differentiating between different types of SMOI activities. To this end, this research develops and tests a conceptual framework, which predicts that (1) a firm's sustainability orientation (SO) is positively associated with its NPD performance, (2) customer focus (CF) partially mediates the SO-NPD performance link, and (3) particular SMOI activities moderate the CF-NPD performance link. The empirical results, using data from the Product Development and Management Association (PDMA)'s comparative performance assessment study, provide support for most of the framework. Notably, this research documents a positive link between SO and NPD performance, as well as a partial mediating role of CF. The results further suggest that social media driven open innovation activities focused on gathering market insights enhance CF directly, while social media driven open innovation activities that garner technical expertise enhance the link between CF and NPD performance. This paper bridges the separate literatures on sustainability and open innovation, and contributes to the NPD research. The findings suggest that managers should take a strategic approach to sustainability and embed it in the NPD process. Furthermore, managers should manage social media based open innovation carefully to fully benefit the firm during the front end and back end of NPD.;3;Business;Ref408;Q1;2016
Open Innovation means that valuable ideas can come from inside or outside the company and can go to market from inside or outside the company as well (Chesbrough, 2006). This concept is a decade old and is still alive and thriving concept that we need to integrate it into the broader stream of innovation literature focusing on collaboration with external partners (Vanhaverbeke, Chesbrough, & West, 2014). Society of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity (SOItmC) in conjunction with 8th Knowledge Cities World Summit (KCWS) organised a conference at Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST) in 2015. The theme of the conference was open innovation, knowledge city, and creative economy'. The concrete meaning of this theme is twofold. The first leads us to motivate to make use of open innovation to build up knowledge city. The other motivates us to make creative economy, which is based on creative knowledge and technology through knowledge city. Most articles in this special issue were initially presented at this conference held at Daegu in South Korea. We triggered open innovation to motivate knowledge city and creative economy. Our conference made open innovation as the logical background of eight Korea creative economy centres.;3;Business;Ref409;Q2;2016
The open innovation (OI) paradigm emphasizes the importance of integrating inbound and outbound flows of technology to increase a firm's innovation performance. While the synergies between technology inflows and outflows have been discussed in conceptual OI articles, the majority of empirical studies have typically focused on either the inward or the outward dimension of OI. According to recent reviews of OI literature, there is a need for further research that takes an integrated perspective on this topic and studies the combination of the inbound and outbound dimensions of OI. This paper follows these calls by focusing on technology licensing as the main contractual form for OI, and by investigating the relationship between technology in-licensing and out-licensing activities at the firm level of analysis. In particular, this paper argues that technology in-licensing positively influences the volume of technology out-licensing through two mechanisms. The firstresource-basedoccurs because in-licensing investments expand and enrich the firm's technology base, thus increasing its value and, as a result, creating more opportunities for out-licensing. The secondcapabilities-basedoccurs because, due to commonalities between technology in-licensing and out-licensing in terms of performed tasks and required skills, repeated execution of in-licensing transactions contributes to the development of higher out-licensing capabilities and, as a result, increase out-licensing volume. These arguments are tested using a panel dataset of 837 Spanish manufacturing firms over the period 1998-2007. Consistent with the predictions, the empirical analysis shows that higher investments in in-licensing and more extensive in-licensing experience lead to superior volumes of technology out-licensing. These results contribute to research on OI and licensing, by empirically showing the existence of positive interactions between technology inflows and outflows and of synergies in the development of absorptive and desorptive capacities.;3;Business;Ref410;Q1;2016
The main objective of this article is to answer the question: How does one make a new' business model framework in a knowledge-based economy? In an effort to advance this issue, we built a research framework based on literature reviews. In addition, we performed social experiments at DGIST during 2011-2015 to arrive at a new business model framework. There are four different active business model-building processes. First is the customer open innovation-based business model developing circle. Second is the user open innovation-based business model developing circle. Third is the social entrepreneurship-based business model developing circle and fourth is the engineer open innovation-based business model developing circle. Empirical research to confirm the operation status of business model approaches, the study makes use of patents database.;3;Business;Ref411;Q2;2016
While open innovation has become a popular strategy to enhance innovation in firms, open innovation in the context of entrepreneurship is not yet well understood. Particularly in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the necessity of understanding the role of entrepreneurship combined with open innovation is much greater. This research focuses on the role of entrepreneurship in the open innovation process and its impact on innovation performance. Our primary research question is: What are the impacts of open innovation, entrepreneurship and their synergy effects onto innovation performance, especially onto Korean Information Technology (IT) SMEs? To answer this question, a survey was conducted about open innovation, entrepreneurship orientation, business models and sales, and innovation performance for approximately 400 Korean SMEs in the IT sector. The regression results and findings from the analysis are presented and discussed.;3;Business;Ref412;Q2;2016
The purpose of this study is to empirically investigate the firm- and regional-level determinants of a firm's adoption of open innovation practices. In particular, we categorise sixteen Korean regions into seven regional innovation types to account for each regions' varying innovation conditions. Using data from the Korean Innovation Survey and a hierarchical linear model, we find that firm-level factors such as firm size, R&D innovation capability and the number of networks for absorbing external knowledge and regional-level factors such as local government R&D funds matching had a significantly positive effect on open innovation. We also find that of the firm-level determinants, the number of networks had a strong effect on open innovation, and that this differed by regional innovation type. Based on these findings, we argue that innovation policy should strive to stimulate open innovation through measures that take each region's innovation resources and environment into account, rather than attempting to look for a single optimised model for all regions.;3;Business;Ref413;Q2;2016
The open innovation (OI) paradigm describes how firms innovate by interacting with other organizations. Several authors found that specific OI strategies have a positive effect on economic and industrial innovation performance. Nevertheless, over-search and over-collaboration phenomena might reduce the OI marginal returns when a firm resorts to additional external innovation partners. This article hypothesizes that the variety of external innovation channels (search breadth) used by a firm, the extent to which a firm draws deeply from them (search depth) and the extent to which a firm collaborates through different external channels (coupled OI) are curvilinearly related with innovation performance. The empirical models are estimated using 84,919 firms from Eurostat's Community Innovation Survey, which was conducted in 2008 across European countries. The results suggest that search breadth is curvilinearly related with all the measures of innovation performance, whereas search depth is not subject to diminishing marginal returns in most cases. Furthermore, this article shows that coupled OI is curvilinearly related with the development and commercialization of radically new products. The findings of this study make several contributions both in a practical perspective, showing how managers can put into practice different OI strategies to influence innovation performance, and in a theoretical perspective, suggesting a number of recommendations for future research.

In this paper, a technology for production scheduling is addressed for the sustainability and open innovation in a manufacturing business. Methodologies for scheduling jobs on parallel machines with the fixed processing property are devised. The fixed processing property, in which a group of specific jobs can be processed on the predetermined machine, can be found in most manufacturing systems due to the quality issues. Usually, even though parallel machines can process various types of jobs, the fixed processing is preferred as to not deteriorate products' quality in real manufacturing systems. To minimize makespan of jobs, which is defined as the final completion time of all jobs, technology for production scheduling is developed. Several heuristic algorithms are devised for solving the problem and to evaluate performance of the suggested algorithms, a series of computational experiments is performed. Results show that better solutions are obtained by the suggested algorithms in a reasonable amount of computation time. That is, if the proposed technology is applied to the production scheduling system of a real manufacturing business, it can be expected that quantity and quality of the product will be enhanced since they are influenced by the production scheduling.;18;Computer;Ref415;Q2;2016
In a distributed world, relationships and partnering become even more critical for business, as delivering on rising and complex demands and addressing complex issues is more than one organization can do alone. Such a situation constitutes a huge challenge for many organizations. Building on an inductive case study of an open innovation initiative, illustrating the complex and messy nature of such organizing, we outline five design principles that appear fundamental to the organizing for collaborative innovation. These design principles are our main contribution to the emerging research on organizing for collaborative innovation as they form a perspective and a conceptual tool to talk about and understand the messiness and disorganization of dynamic and discontinuous contemporary organizational constructs.;3;Business;Ref416;Q1;2016
Drugs available in the market today, selected several years ago under very uncertain future scenario, have experienced a long and expensive process of research and development carried out following both a closed and an open innovation path. To support this critical selection process, we propose a Decision Support System, able to choose among different candidates the most promising drugs along their best development path. The Decision Support System, based on a real options portfolio optimization model, mapping tools, and what-if rules as well, has been applied to a numerical example available in literature, and the research findings show interesting managerial and academic implications.

This article introduces the special issue on the increasing role of cities as a driver for (open) innovation and entrepreneurship. It frames the innovation space being cultivated by proactive cities. Drawing on the diverse papers selected in this special issue, this introduction explores a series of tensions that are emerging as innovators and entrepreneurs seek to engage with local governments and citizens in an effort to improve the quality of life and promote local economic growth.;3;Business;Ref418;Q1;2016
The way people innovate and create new ideas and bring them to the market is undergoing a fundamental change from closed innovation to open innovation. Why and how do firms perform open innovation? Firms' open innovation is measured through the levels of firms' joint patent applications. Next, we analyze network structures and characters of firms' joint patent applications such as betweenness and degree centrality, structure hole, and closure. From this research, we drew conclusions as follows. First, the structure of collaboration networks has both direct and indirect effects on firms' innovative performance. Second, in the process of joint patent applications, there is a long tail phenomenon in networks of joint patent applications. Third, the number of patents and International Patent Classification (IPC) subclasses together constitute a meaningful measure of the innovation performance of firms.;18;Computer;Ref419;Q2;2016
What do we need for sustainable artificial intelligence that is not harmful but beneficial human life? This paper builds up the interaction model between direct and autonomous learning from the human's cognitive learning process and firms' open innovation process. It conceptually establishes a direct and autonomous learning interaction model. The key factor of this model is that the process to respond to entries from external environments through interactions between autonomous learning and direct learning as well as to rearrange internal knowledge is incessant. When autonomous learning happens, the units of knowledge determinations that arise from indirect learning are separated. They induce not only broad autonomous learning made through the horizontal combinations that surpass the combinations that occurred in direct learning but also in-depth autonomous learning made through vertical combinations that appear so that new knowledge is added. The core of the interaction model between direct and autonomous learning is the variability of the boundary between proven knowledge and hypothetical knowledge, limitations in knowledge accumulation, as well as complementarity and conflict between direct and autonomous learning. Therefore, these should be considered when introducing the interaction model between direct and autonomous learning into navigations, cleaning robots, search engines, etc. In addition, we should consider the relationship between direct learning and autonomous learning when building up open innovation strategies and policies.;18;Computer;Ref420;Q2;2016
Open innovation communities represent an effective strategy to provide organizations with a wider range of ideas, reducing the costs associated to R&D. Its main problem is the large volume of information generated in the form of proposed innovations that should be internally processed and executed by employed experts. The purpose of this work consists of identifying the profiles of the so-called innovation solvers using only their participation characteristics extracted from open innovation communities, which are modelled as social networks, and applying particle swarm optimization. Findings can improve the absorptive capacity of organizations by focusing on those users with more chances of generating potentially adoptable ideas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This research paper investigates open innovation-that is, the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge in order to innovate-in the context of nonprofit sports clubs, and is based on the content analysis of semi-structured interviews held with representatives of eleven sports clubs. The study develops a framework that describes open innovation activities in nonprofit sports clubs as facets of four superordinate dimensions, namely permeability of the club's boundary, application and implementation of open innovation practices, managerial competencies, and the environmental and organizational surroundings in which the club operates. Within these dimensions, subordinate facets such as commitment of the club's president and the strategic use of coopetitive environments explain how and why sports clubs are successful at implementing innovations and how their nonprofit status (e.g., volunteer work) contributes to (or is in conflict with) innovation. The findings provide implications for nonprofit organizations inside and outside the sports sector.;19;Social;Ref422;Q1;2016
In this article, we explore the relationship between two key aspects of open innovation in small firmsabsorptive capacity (ACAP) and external relationshipsand their effects on growth in the U.S. and European biopharmaceutical sectors. Results from an international sample of 349 biopharmaceutical firms surveyed in the United States, United Kingdom, France, and Germany suggest that realized ACAP plays an important role in determining firms' growth. In terms of the interaction between firms' ACAP and external relationships, we find that engagement with exploratory relationships depends strongly on the continuity of R&D, while participation in exploitative relationships is more conditional on firms' realized ACAP.;3;Business;Ref423;Q1;2016
The transition towards a bioeconomy is increasingly viewed by both policy makers and scholars as one of the primary ways to reduce our dependency on fossil resources. However, socio-economic research on the transition towards the bioeconomy at the firm-level remains scarce. Specifically, studies approaching the bioeconomy from the technology and innovation management (TIM) concepts are particularly uncommon, although the importance of knowledge generation and innovation is considered crucial to make the transition towards a greener economy. In this study, we take a first step in addressing this issue by developing a set of guiding principles for the management of innovation processes in the bioeconomy comprised in three key issues: the relevant stakeholder groups and their importance in innovation development within the bioeconomy, the innovation network strategy and management, and organizational features considered prerequisites for collaborative innovation. This called for an identification of influencing factors specific to the bioeconomy context and the establishment of basic characteristics of innovation processes in the bioeconomy. The five identified influencing factors, the basic innovation process characteristics, and the guidelines and recommendations presented in this paper are based on insights derived from a four-staged literature research of the bioeconomy and TIM literature. In particular, we focused on the Open Innovation approach because of the evident fit between this approach and the requirements for innovation in the bioeconomy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Building on knowledge-based dynamic capabilities, this paper examines how knowledge capabilities influence the effectiveness of open innovation inbound and outbound activities on radical innovation performance. Based on a survey of 213 firms, the statistical results indicate that the effectiveness of open innovation inbound and outbound activities is contingent on the presence of knowledge acquisition capabilities and knowledge sharing capabilities. Specifically, a firm practicing inbound activities to strengthen radical innovation is more likely to benefit from knowledge sharing capabilities than from knowledge acquisition capabilities. In contrast, a firm practicing outbound activities is more likely to enhance radical innovation performance through knowledge acquisition capabilities than through knowledge sharing capabilities. Managerial implications and research contributions are provided, followed by a discussion of future research directions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;3;Business;Ref425;Q1;2016
Firms increasingly acquire technological knowledge from external sources to improve their innovation performance. This strategic approach is known as inbound open innovation. The existing empirical evidence regarding the impact of inbound open innovation on performance, however, is ambiguous. The equivocal results are due to moderating factors that influence a firm's ability to acquire technological knowledge from external sources and to transform it into innovation outputs. This paper focuses on a relevant yet overlooked category of moderating factors: organization of research and development (R&D). It explores two organizational mechanisms: one informal and external-oriented (involvement of external consultants in R&D activities) and one formalized and internal-oriented (existence of a dedicated R&D unit), in the acquisition of technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing, a particular contractual form for inbound open innovation. Drawing on a capabilities perspective and using a longitudinal dataset of 841 Spanish manufacturing firms observed over the period 1999-2007, this paper provides a fine-grained analysis of the moderating effects of the two organizational mechanisms. The involvement of external consultants in R&D activities strengthens the impact of inbound open innovation on innovation performance by increasing marginal benefits of acquiring external technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing. Moreover, it reduces the level of inbound open innovation to which the highest innovation performance corresponds. Instead, the existence of a dedicated R&D unit makes the firm less sensitive to changes in the level of inbound open innovation, by reducing marginal benefits of acquiring external technological knowledge through R&D outsourcing, and increases the level of inbound open innovation to which the highest innovation performance corresponds. The results regarding the role of informal and formalized R&D organizational mechanisms contribute to research on open innovation and absorptive capacity, and also inform managers as to what organizational mechanism is recommended to acquire external technological knowledge, depending on the objectives that the firm pursues.;3;Business;Ref426;Q1;2016
"This paper reports on the application and evaluation of a participatory approach called Regional Open Innovation Roadmapping (ROIR), which brings together different stakeholders to jointly develop strategies for the implementation of regional innovations. More specifically, ROIR is a tool to promote sustainable regional development that integrates ""open innovation"" elements in technology roadmapping. We applied this approach to the introduction of the innovative building-related urban agriculture subtype known as ""Zero-acreage farming"" (ZFarming) to the Berlin metropolitan area. ZFarming includes rooftop gardens, rooftop greenhouses, edible green walls, indoor farms and/or vertical greenhouses. Thus, the ROIR approach was applied between 2011 and 2013 to define sustainable development options for ZFarming in Berlin, specifically aiming both to find possible ZFarming models for Berlin and to develop guidelines for their sustainable implementation. During the participatory process, approximately 50 contributors established a stakeholder network and jointly defined a roadmap to enable administrators, politicians, citizens and practitioners to effectively address ZFarming. An ex-post evaluation was conducted in 2014 via an online survey to estimate the effects of the ROIR approach on (a) knowledge generation, (b) new stakeholder network establishment, (c) new project implementation and (d) the general perception of ZFarming. The results revealed that the ROIR process stimulated the establishment of new networks and alliances, contributed to knowledge generation and created a common understanding for the future implementation of ZFarming among diverse stakeholders.

Geographic research on firm-level innovation is generally premised on the idea of open innovation, suggesting that innovation occurs more readily in urban settings or clusters, which generate local buzz and allow access to external actors. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that firms also introduce first-to-market innovations in remote locations. In this exploratory paper, building upon work by Philip McCann, we outline a conceptual framework that connects innovators (differentiated by information source and frequency of interaction with interlocutors) and location (distance from a metropolitan area): slow innovators, relying on non-market-sourced information and infrequent contacts, will be overrepresented in isolated locations. Fast innovators, relying on market-sourced information and frequent interactions, will locate closer to cities. Our results confirm this. Our interpretation of these results - slow innovators are more reliant on technological information which loses value more slowly than faster decaying market-oriented information - requires further investigation.;3;Business;Ref428;Q1;2016
Research question: This study conceptualizes and tests the impact of a coopetition-based open innovation approach on organizational performance of nonprofit sports clubs. In particular, it examines the effect of collaborations with competitors (i.e. coopetition) on the organizational performance of clubs via both use of outside knowledge and the adoption of new services, processes, and business models (i.e. organizational-level innovations). Research methods: A statewide online survey with 292 members of the board of directors of nonprofit sports clubs was conducted in Germany (Saarland). The survey used valid and reliable scales and considered self-reported financial stability and membership development as organizational performance indicators. Structural equation modeling was applied to test the mediation model. Results and findings: The proposed coopetition-based open innovation model has a good model fit. Engagement in coopetition has a positive effect on organizational performance via two sequential mediators: use of outside knowledge and innovation implementation. In addition, use of outside knowledge has a direct positive effect on organizational performance. Implications: Nonprofit sports clubs should take advantage of collaborations with competitors and exploit external knowledge to the best of their abilities. The adoption of new services, processes, and business models on the organizational level helps nonprofit sports clubs stay competitive in an increasingly contested sports services market. The study provides both theoretical and managerial implications that help sports clubs innovate and increase organizational performance.;19;Social;Ref429;Q1;2016
One novel implication of the open innovation paradigm is that inflows and outflows of knowledge are complementary. We argue that engaging simultaneously in buying and selling knowledge should allow firms to increase innovation outcomes. At the same time, we identify some of the relevant costs (cognitive, transaction, and organizational costs) that open firms can reduce by combining knowledge inflows and outflows. Empirically, however, we find no evidence for such complementarity in a sample of Belgian manufacturing firms. Firms buying and selling knowledge do increase their sales of new products, but at the same time their R&D costs increase more than proportionally. Our findings, therefore, indicate the need for research into a better understanding of the drivers of actual costs of organizing for open innovation.

A few researchers have studied the relationship of open innovation and firm performance, but the results are controversial. One of the reasons for this inconsistence may be the ignorance of the impact on the external environment. Under the context of open innovation, innovation activities are divided into inbound open innovation and outbound open innovation. Based on a sample of 224 Chinese entrepreneurs from the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta, the relationship between the two kinds of open innovation and firm growth is discussed, and how this relationship is being affected by environment competitiveness (EC) and environment munificence (EM) is explored. Results show that both the inbound open and outbound open innovations have a positive effect on firm growth. Both EC and EM weaken the relationship between inbound open and firm growth. The study also finds a negative effect of both EC and EM on the relationship between outbound open innovation and firm growth significantly. Limitations and suggestions are proposed for future research on the implementation of open innovation under different circumstances.;3;Business;Ref431;Q3;2016
Open innovation (OI) means that innovation is fostered by using both external and internal influences in the innovation process. In software engineering (SE), OI has existed for decades, while we currently see a faster and broader move towards OI in SE. We therefore survey research on how OI takes place and contributes to innovation in SE. This study aims to synthesize the research knowledge on OI in the SE domain. We launched a systematic mapping study and conducted a thematic analysis of the results. Moreover, we analyzed the strength of the evidence in the light of a rigor and relevance assessment of the research. We identified 33 publications, divided into 9 themes related to OI. 17/33 studies fall in the high-rigor/high-relevance category, suggesting the results are highly industry relevant. The research indicates that start-ups have higher tendency to opt for OI compared to incumbents. The evidence also suggests that firms assimilating knowledge into their internal R&D activities, have higher likelihood of gaining financial advantages. We concluded that OI should be adopted as a complementary approach to facilitate internal innovation and not to substitute it. Further research is advised on situated OI strategies and the interplay between OI and agile practices.;5;Computer;Ref432;Q1;2016

Although open innovation has become increasingly established in the management literature, comprehensive theoretical explanations of what drives firms to be open are sparse. Taking the perspective of the behavioral theory of the firm, we conceive of open innovation as a form of nonlocal search, arguing that firms will turn to open innovation when substantially under- or over-performing relative to their aspirations. We further enquire how this relationship is moderated by firm-specific innovation-related resources: human capital, research and development investment, and patents. Employing a representative survey of UK firms, we find some evidence of moderation, allowing us to present explanations of search through open innovation and contribute to the behavioral theory of the firm itself.;3;Business;Ref434;Q1;2016
This article analyzes how the patent stock of new entrants in industries shaped by systemic innovations influences their subsequent openness in innovation. The results suggest that patenting increases new entrants' number of open innovation relationships, on average. This association, however, varies across relationships of differing technology intensity. While the effect of patenting is strongly positive for technology-intensive relationships, it becomes weaker as the technology intensity decreases, and turns negative for least technology-intensive relationships.;3;Business;Ref435;Q1;2016
"Despite mounting evidence on the potential benefits of inbound open innovation, little is known about how firms purposefully manage inflows of knowledge. We investigate the use of two knowledge governance procedures-project management and knowledge matching-in collaborative inbound open innovation. Our findings suggest that, in addition to ""knowledge-precursors,"" which the literature on open innovation and absorptive capacity has shown to be important for the integration of external knowledge, the firm's choice of knowledge governance matters for innovation performance.";3;Business;Ref436;Q1;2016
Open innovation and business process innovation (BPI) have been investigated by their respective research communities for decades. However, the important relationship between externally focused open innovation and internally implemented BPI is currently unexplored, particularly in transition economies. The main purpose of this study is to contribute toward closing this important research gap. This study describes the main findings of a research study of innovation practices of 224 companies operating in a transition economy. We propose and validate a comprehensive model of integrative innovation and offer some important insights into the relationship between externally focused R&D collaboration and a firm's internal process innovation.

Despite a growing interest in the phenomenon of open innovation (OI), empirical evidence documenting the link between new product development capabilities, OI practices, and new product innovativeness is scarce. Eminent scholars have called for large-scale studies that systematically investigate the OI paradigm. Drawing on the knowledge-based view of the firm, new product development, and NPD capabilities literature streams, we conceptualize a framework in which OI practices are disentangled according to the stage of the new product development process in which they occur (development stage or commercialization stage). We identify two major types of OI practices: development-centric OI (which occurs in the development stage) and commercialization-centric OI (which occurs in the commercialization stage). Specific types of NPD capabilities-R&D, market information management, and launch-are expected to both influence the extent to which each OI practice is implemented and moderate the effect of each OI practice on product portfolio innovativeness and firm performance. The empirical analysis combines primary data from a survey of 239 firms with secondary data on innovation and financial outcomes. Our results support our hypotheses and indicate a need to differentiate among the different kinds of OI practices while elaborating on the complex role played by NPD capabilities in influencing OI practices.;3;Business;Ref438;Q1;2016

How can a firm develop new ideas and turn them into profitable innovations on a sustained basis? We address this fundamental issue in a novel way by developing an integrative framework of absorptive capacity (AC) and inbound open innovation that is rooted in the attention-based view of the firm. We specifically address why a balance between open and closed innovation is important from the perspective of absorptive capacity, and show how it may be brought about. Pursuing either open or closed inbound innovation alone may result in an imbalance between potential AC and realized AC as well as inward-looking AC and outward-looking AC, which will hinder innovative performance. We argue that practicing open and closed inbound innovation repeatedly and alternately by switching organizational attentions, and thus developing the associated AC, can facilitate balancing absorptive capacity and lead to innovative performance.

"Search for external knowledge is vital for firms' innovative activities. To understand search, we propose two knowledge search dimensions: search space (local or distant) and search heuristics (experiential or cognitive). Combining these two dimensions, we distinguish four search paths - situated paths, analogical paths, sophisticated paths, and scientific paths - which respond to recent calls to move beyond ""where to search"" and to investigate the connection with ""how to search."" Also, we highlight how the mechanisms of problem framing and boundary spanning operate within each search path to identify solutions to technology problems. We report on a study of 18 open innovation projects that used an innovation intermediary, and outline the characteristics of each search path. Exploration of these search paths enriches previous studies of search in open innovation by providing a comprehensive, but structured, framework that explains search, its underlying mechanisms, and potential outcomes.

The open innovation paradigm has created opportunities for the emergence of new actors to provide support for open innovation. It is acknowledged that knowledge creation is pivotal to innovation, but this has yet to be discussed in the context of open innovation intermediation. This paper based on a longitudinal study of SAFER, a traffic and vehicle safety research centre in Sweden, explores the role of an actor whose objective is to support joint knowledge creation in open innovation. Theoretical models of knowledge creation are used in the analysis and the identified activities go beyond intermediation, and include peer collaboration and mobilisation of a collective strategic body. These activities are fundamental to an open innovation arena here introduced as a new type of actor. The paper challenges the established focal firm perspective in open innovation and introduces the open innovation arena to underline knowledge creation among peers.;8;Engineering;Ref442;Q1;2016
How can small firms manage and benefit from open innovation? We study three Taiwan's biotechnology firms leveraging open innovation in developing new drugs. At the phase of the new drug discovery, two companies acquired technology from external sources. CSRC Synpac Company acquired technology from Professor Yuan-Tsong Chen at Duke University (USA) in 1991. GlycoNex Company acquired technology from Professor Sen-itiroh Hakomori at University of Washington (USA) in 2001. AbGenomics Company developed its own technology at Professor Rong-Hwa Lin's team at National Taiwan University (Taiwan) in 2000. Through technology transfer, CSRC Synpac Company licensed out the new drug Myozyme to Genzyme Corporation (USA) in 2000. AbGenomics Company licensed out the new drug AbGn-168H to Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceutical (Germany) in 2005. GlycoNex Company licensed out the new drug GNX-8 to Otsuka Pharmaceutical (Japan) in 2009.;8;Engineering;Ref443;Q1;2016
Involvement in different open innovation activities by using inflows and outflows of knowledge becomes the important premise for a successful business. However, on a global scale, open innovation literature does not pay enough attention to the international dimension, which is essential when seeking to increase the performance of overseas firm's activities. Therefore, the paper aims to highlight coherences of open innovation and internationalization by analyzing knowledge intensive SMEs in Lithuania. Referring to case studies approach it is disclosed how much firms are open in performing innovative activities by collaborating, how they share knowledge, what main profiles of national and foreign partners are and how open innovation is applied in internationalizing firm's activity. The research results indicated that while innovating firms were mostly focused on the R&D ecosystem oriented and innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem oriented networks at the national level. However, when internationalizing firm's activities, the preference to the international value chain oriented innovation network was disclosed. It contributes to the theory of open innovation from the knowledge intensive firms' internationalization point of view, especially in the understanding of open innovation's role in pursuing fast development in foreign markets while providing further knowledge on internationalization of firms originating from Baltic region area.;3;Business;Ref444;Q2;2016
The literature on open innovation (OI) is characterised by studies based both on large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Among all, one of the less explored issues in SMEs is what impedes them to adopt OI. Thus, this paper has the threefold objective to identify which factors hinder the adoption of OI in SMEs, to investigate if different behaviours exist among SMEs in relation to these factors, and to understand if the same factors effectively influence the level of adoption of OI. Based on a survey on 157 Italian SMEs, we identified four main barriers (namely, 'knowledge', 'collaboration', 'organisational', and 'financial and strategic') and three profiles of firms, different in terms of innovativeness of the industries they belong to (knowledge intensive, medium-innovative, and less innovative) and hampering factors perceived ('knowledge', 'financial and strategic', and 'collaboration' and 'organisational' barriers). Moreover, we found that some of these factors effectively impede the adoption of the paradigm.;3;Business;Ref445;Q2;2016
"Purpose - This paper aims to increase understanding of how firms can more effectively identify valuable and profitable innovations in the pharmaceutical industry and to identify the issues and challenges posed by current managerial decision-making practices. Design/methodology/approach - A case study of a single project is presented: a drug in-licensing decision made by a team of three managers in a large Australian pharmaceutical firm. Using participant-observation, interviews and archival analysis, the authors followed the managers as they identified and evaluated 122 late-stage anti-diabetic drug variants for further development. Findings - The managers used decision heuristics to arrive at a short list of three drugs from a choice set of 122. While the process was ostensibly rational and systematic, there was evidence of data quality issues, misleading mental models and cognitive bias. The authors concluded a high probability of accepting a poor candidate or rejecting a stronger candidate (i.e. making Type I and II errors). Research limitations/implications - This paper focuses on initial market and technology evaluation stage only (i.e. not commercialization) and is a single case study design; therefore, care should be taken in generalizing to other decisions or other contexts. This paper highlights the need for further research integrating organizational decision-making and open innovation from a multi-disciplinary perspective. Practical/implications - This paper raises awareness of potential decision-making pitfalls and includes a detailed audit framework to support improved managerial decision processes and double rather than single loop learning. Social/implications - The findings support better decision-making and therefore supports higher quality drug selection and development, leading to improved population health outcomes. Originality/value - Multi-disciplinary, draws attention of marketing and new product development scholars to open innovation research. It adds to knowledge about open innovation practices at the project level. It also provides an extended model of market opportunity analysis for high technology markets.";3;Business;Ref446;Q1;2016
Open innovation (OI) is becoming an increasingly important paradigm for successful technological innovation. Although many studies have explored how firms' learning capability and market orientation individually enable technological innovation, few have examined them together in the context of OI-based technology acquisition (OITA). To address this important issue, this study investigates the causal relationships among firms' learning capability, market orientation, and OITA, and explores how these relationships influence firms' technological innovation. The study tests its proposed conceptual model through a survey of Korean manufacturing firms. The results indicate that OITA influences firms' technological innovation, that market orientation is a precondition for establishing learning capability, and that market orientation influences OITA through that learning capability. This study contributes to the OI literature by providing empirical evidence of how firms can enhance their innovation potential through their learning capability and market orientation.;8;Engineering;Ref447;Q1;2016
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate what types of open innovation search strategies are associated with internal innovation activities in family and non-family SMEs within natural resource-based clusters. Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on an empirical analysis of a sample of 245 Chilean firms. Findings - Results suggest that while family and non-family SMEs do not significantly differ in terms of internal innovation activities, important differences exist in terms of open innovation search strategies. In particular, family SMEs search for new ideas and knowledge within their closest network of relationships (e.g. customers, suppliers and competitors), whereas non-family SMEs mainly focus on broader network relationships (e.g. universities, public institutions and fair trade organizations). Practical implications - This study shows that within a natural resource cluster, the types of firm do matter. In fact, family and non-family SMEs use different open innovation search strategies to innovate; hence, this research may help and assist policy makers in tailoring innovation policies aimed at expanding the potential benefits of clusters for regional growth and development. Originality/value - This research addresses the call to further investigate the link between family SMEs and innovation in developing countries, given that SMEs may also act as a lively player for regional development.";3;Business;Ref448;Q2;2016
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the innovation performance in the Hungarian food chain using the concept of open innovation. Design/methodology/approach - Empirical analysis is based on the data from a 2014 survey of more than 300 small-and medium-sized agricultural producers, food processors and food retailers. The authors analyse innovation performance taking into account not only the direct impacts of external knowledge inflows and absorptive capacity, but also the indirect effect of external knowledge inflows mediated by the existence of potentially complementary internal resources (absorptive capacity). The authors determine the impact of open innovation and a company's absorptive capacity on innovation performance employing two stage approaches. First, the authors apply a semi-non parametric probit model. Second, the authors run cluster analysis to categorize companies based on their open innovation, absorptive capacity, firm and managerial characteristics. Findings - Results imply the openness along the food chain may decrease the introduction time of innovation in all areas of innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The openness towards competitors may decrease the introduction time of innovation with regard to technological innovation, but it may increase with regard to product innovation, as well the innovation propensity. The absorptive capacity decreases the introduction time of technological product, organizational and market innovation. There is a positive relationship between the use of external knowledge (when it is defined as openness with competitors) and own innovation capacity with regard to innovation propensity, but not when it is defined as openness along the food chain. The enterprises of the sample are dividing into two groups: innovative (dominated by processors) and not innovative ones (dominated by producers and retailers). Research limitations/implications - Some limitations of the paper are worth mentioning. The study is limited in its scope with regard to the research setting and the unit of analysis (Hungarian food chain). With regard to the former, our sample consists of 302 SMEs along the food chain, almost equally distributed as producers, processors and retailers. At the end of 2014 in Hungary there were 7,766 producers, 2,681 processors and 6,420 retailers in this category, which means 1.3 - 3.7 per cent coverage (Agrargazdasagi Kutatointezet, 2014). Regarding the latter, the paper defines food chain in a narrow sense (three levels); therefore, the results represent the perspectives of a limited number of food chain partners (producers, processors, retailers). Were the definition to be widened, input from additional members would be necessary (such as suppliers of suppliers, customers of customers, third parties or competitors). Nevertheless, although the scope may be narrow, it is appropriate for our objective. Future research is recommended to overcome the paper's limitations (i.e. extend its scope to other countries, sectors and levels of chain). Practical implications - The analysis provides valuable inputs for policy makers and SMEs along the food chain that wish to build and improve (open) innovation system. Policy makers would need more targeted innovation development programmes in order to solve the tight innovation bottlenecks. These programmes should target first of all at expanding the absorptive capacities of the food chain's enterprises. The authors also need further research in order to investigate how much the restricted use of open innovation systems in the Hungarian food enterprises is linked to the cost and benefits of creation such systems. Originality/value - The authors analyse innovation performance taking into account not only the direct impacts of external knowledge inflows and absorptive capacity, but also the indirect effect of external knowledge inflows mediated by the existence of potentially complementary internal resources (absorptive capacity).";1;Agriculture;Ref449;Q1;2016
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of the level of integration of management systems (IMS) over product and process innovation capabilities (IC), by considering the role of open innovation (OI) activities as a moderating effect of those relationships. Design/methodology/approach - A longitudinal empirical study was performed on an existing Spanish panel database that contains information related to innovation, where 9,765 companies were selected for the panel analysis. A logit approach with random effects was considered. Findings - The level of IMS positively influences process and product IC. Moreover, external cooperation, and using it to a high extent not only positively moderates the effects of the level of IMS over process IC, but also of process over product IC, where it becomes indispensable for its effect to be positive. Finally, investing in external knowledge is a positive moderator of the effects of the level of IMS over both: process and product IC. Originality/value - This is one of the first studies on empirically finding evidence of the impact of the level of IMS on process and product IC, and of the moderating effect of performing OI activities in order to achieve higher process and product IC through the IMS.;5;Computer;Ref450;Q1;2016
The concept of innovation intermediaries has gained relevance in the innovation management literature due to the role they play in supporting innovation processes. This paper focuses on the concept of 'trust builders'. These are defined as volunteers that cooperate with firms, facilitating their interaction with other stakeholders in developing innovation projects. The role of 'trust builders' is analyzed from the impact they have on the territory, promoting initiatives that influence and improve local competitiveness through joint activities. The research is based on a case study conducted in Durango County, Spain. It aims to explore the impact of trust builders' activity in the increased willingness of cooperation and coopetition in the territory. Our results suggest that trust builders constitute an interesting mechanism to promote new products, processes, and technological and market opportunities through knowledge sharing.;3;Business;Ref451;Q1;2016
Over the past decade, the concept of open innovation has received substantial attention. Research has ranged from case study representations to large-scale quantitative studies using the Community Innovation Survey data or developing novel approaches to measuring open innovation. In this study, we conceptualise and validate a firm-level measure of proclivity for open innovation, which relates to the firm's predisposition to perform inbound and outbound open innovation activities. To do so, we focus on smaller firms, assessing their organisational and behavioural perspectives related to open innovation. Building on existing scholarly research and a field study, we begin by conceptualising the theoretical framework of the multidimensional construct. We then develop and validate its measurement scale on two cross-cultural samples. The measure contains the following dimensions: inward IP licensing and external participation, outsourcing R&D and external networking, customer involvement, employee involvement, venturing, and outward IP licensing. Our results indicate that the measure has good reliability and validity. Implications for future research are also discussed.;3;Business;Ref452;Q1;2016
The research presented in this paper explores the effect of inbound, outbound and coupled open innovation practices on firms' performances in the biopharmaceutical industry. Specifically, although existing researches on open innovation effectiveness have separately investigated the effect of open innovation practices on innovation and financial performance, this study evaluates the concurrent effect of these practices on both such performance dimensions in a single framework. We state the importance for a manager to explore concurrently the influence of specific open innovation practices both on innovation and economic-financial performance. We empirically test our framework on a sample of 120 companies listed on the NASDAQ biotechnology index.;8;Engineering;Ref453;Q1;2016
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationships between the openness of firms and their innovation and financial performances. Design/methodology/approach - In order to investigate such relationships, data on inbound and outbound open innovation (OI) processes and performances of 110 worldwide top research and development (R&D) spending bio-pharmaceutical companies are collected via the consolidated annual reports and the PATSTAT database. The time period of the analysis is 2008-2012. Findings - Regarding innovation performances, R&D productivity and revenues to patents ratio decrease with openness, whilst patents growth is not influenced by OI adoption. As to financial performances, sales growth exhibits a positive trend with openness, while operating profit and turnover decrease with OI adoption. Particularly, an inverted U-relationship with inbound and a U-shape one with outbound are observed as of operating profit. Research limitations/implications - The study adds to the knowledge about the effect of openness on firms' performances, a topic of increasing interest to academics, managers and policy makers. Both inbound and outbound facets of the phenomenon are taken into account. Practical implications - Understanding how openness affects performances enables more informed decision making by managers, leading to a more effective use of OI activities. Originality/value - The work provides new insights as to what ""being open"" means for a company, gauging both inbound and outbound transactions after a pecuniary perspective. Employing objective and continuous measures, the relevance of OI for the whole business of firms can be identified.";3;Business;Ref454;Q1;2016
Purpose - The basic concept of transaction cost theory is that firms like to conduct transactions in a channel with lower transaction costs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to use the transaction cost perspective to identify which conditions cause companies to choose between outbound open innovation (hierarchy governance) and inbound open innovation (market governance). Design/methodology/approach - Accordingly, transaction cost economics was used to relate the choice and implementation of open innovation using a sample of 250 electronics and information start-ups in China. Structural equation modeling was used to conduct confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate measurement model, while logistic regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Findings - As expected, the dedicated asset specificity, human asset specificity, behavioral uncertainty, transaction frequency, and small number exchange were positively associated with outbound open innovation. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper lies in explaining the role played by transaction cost economics in the process of open innovation for start-ups through empirical analysis.;3;Business;Ref455;Q1;2016
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop and test an integrated model to examine the relationship between managerial ties and two types of open innovation (OI). It takes into account the mediating role of realized absorptive capacity and explains how a firm's ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate it and apply it to commercial ends can facilitate OI. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 259 middle and top managers working across different sectors in the United Arab Emirates. Findings - Results obtained using structural equation modeling show that managerial ties facilitate both in-bound and out-bound OI. Results also establish the mediating role of realized absorptive capacity in these relationships. Research limitations/implications - Use of cross-sectional data as was done in this study has been criticized for being inappropriate to test causal models. Besides the findings may not be generalizable to different industries/cultures/regions. Practical implications - This study suggests that managerial ties act to support OI in firms thus giving the insight that managers should be appreciated to build ties with managers of other firms, universities and government officials. Doing so can help firms achieve better OI outcomes. Firms should arrange means of interaction of their managers with these external knowledge sources such as events and occasions where managers of different firms can interact with each other to foster strong ties among them. Originality/value - The above findings contribute theoretically to OI and managerial ties literature while providing insights for practitioners on how to succeed or avoid failure in their OI initiatives. These insights are novel and are new to the OI and managerial ties theory.;3;Business;Ref456;Q1;2016
The literature has shown that open innovation (OI) can be a winning strategy in improving firm performance. However, in order to adopt and implement it, managers need to resolve practical problems, such as understanding the role played by OI capacities and openness on firm performance. In response to these needs, this study aims to investigate the hierarchical relationships between openness, OI capacities and performance using a structural equation model approach. This paper also attempts to compare the levels of openness between firms in different industries to discover similarities and differences in OI phenomena. The analysis of data obtained from a survey of Korean firms shows significant interrelations between openness, OI capacities and firm performance. Our results go further in developing understanding of the building blocks on which successful OI is built and particularly suggest that desorptive capacity which underpins the out-bound OI process, is in turn strongly supported by knowledge management capacity. It is hoped that the results of this study can enrich our understanding of the OI mechanism and provide managerial and policy implications.;3;Business;Ref457;Q2;2016
The paper presents an integrated viewpoint of technological innovation strategy by considering both the firm and industry levels. Further, we provide a new open innovation framework by adopting a knowledge flow perspective using patent citation information. Finally, we consider a firm's outbound open innovation performance using cites per patent information together with financial performance to look at both the practical and the potential effects of technological innovation strategy. Through these analyses, this study examines determinants of open technology innovation activity in the information and communication technology manufacturing industry in Korea and draws managerial and policy implications for effective industry promotion and improvement of technology innovation capability.;3;Business;Ref458;Q2;2016
Nowadays, the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation and to expand the markets for external use of innovation has become essential in business strategies and national policies. In addition, the importance of knowledge and technology diffusion requires better understanding of knowledge networks and national innovation systems (NISs). We want to answer the following research question: what kinds of effects will occur in NISs if different levels of open innovation policies are introduced into NISs? According to our literature review, perfect open innovation policies should have three aspects: knowledge and technology production, distribution and consumption. We built a causal loop diagram and a system dynamics model to simulate the effects of open innovation policies on NISs and apply the results to the case of Cambodia to develop Cambodia's national science and technology master plan.;9;Environmental;Ref459;Q1;2015
This paper explores how an open approach to new venture creation - purposefully managing knowledge flows across the venture's organizational boundary - can be beneficial for start-up entrepreneurs. Our inductive case study, of both failure and success, identifies the key attributes of this open approach and how they affect start-ups' short-term survival. We find that ecosystem collaboration, user involvement and an open environment directly influence new venture survival, and that their effects were moderated by the entrepreneurs' open mindset. These findings carry a number of implications for entrepreneurship and innovation research and practice, providing some attention points for researchers, entrepreneurs, investors and policy makers interested in developing successful new ventures.;3;Business;Ref460;Q1;2015
Thi s paper explores the determinants of a firm's interest in collaborating with universities and whether they differ by the technological level of the company's industry. Based on the conceptual framework of open innovation (OI) model, it is included some aspects related to the transaction costs and roles of innovation diffusion that justifies the study of firmA ' s interest as previous step of an OI relation among firms and partners. The evidence is based on data collected through semi-structured interviews between January 2009 and October 2009, on a sample of 375 firms from three countries: Spain, Portugal, and France. The results indicate that more innovative firms tend to be more interested in collaborating with universities. The paper provides evidence that country factors also affect a firm's intention of collaborating with universities. Finally, the results show that the determinants of a high-tech firm's attitudes to cooperation differ from those found in a non-high-tech firm. In the future, the study of the determinants of those firms' formal decision to cooperate may let us to understand whether the driving forces of both interest in and decision to cooperate differ.;3;Business;Ref461;Q1;2015
"We explore the interaction of open innovation and intellectual property (IP) in two Chinese latecomer pharmaceutical firms in their catch-up process. Studying archival data, documentation, and interviews, we found that the two firms exhibited five periods that were characterised by different open innovation activities and R&D capabilities. In their early stages, the two firms lacked R&D functions; thus, they imported technologies and pursued production-oriented strategies. As they gradually entered into collaborations and established their R&D departments, open innovation and IP protection played important and dynamic roles in this process. Thus, a catch-up process involves not only acquiring technological capabilities and innovative competencies but also transforming a firm's capacity to strategies.";3;Business;Ref462;Q2;2015
"Customers can participate in open innovation communities posting innovation ideas, which in turn can receive comments and votes from the rest of the community, highlighting user preferences. However, the final decision about implementing innovations corresponds to the company. This paper is focused on the customers' activity in open innovation communities. The aim is to identify the main topics of customers' interests in order to compare these topics with managerial decision-making. The results obtained reveal first that both votes and comments can be used to predict user preferences; and second, that customers tend to promote those innovations by reporting more comfort and benefits. In contrast, managerial decisions are more focused on the distinctive features associated with the brand image.";3;Business;Ref463;Q2;2015
This paper explores the role, patterns, and characteristics of technological knowledge co-creation in a cross-organizational setting and examines the relationship between ownership structure and the value of co-created technological knowledge. The empirical results reveal an upward trend in the share of co-created technological knowledge from 1976 to 2008 and show that co-created technological knowledge is more exploratory and pioneering and has shorter technology cycle times (TCTs) than solely created knowledge. Our findings also indicate that the technological knowledge that firms co-create with other firms or with universities is significantly correlated with shorter TCTs and higher numbers of forward citations. Overall, this paper provides new evidence regarding the importance of cross-organizational technological knowledge co-creation.;3;Business;Ref464;Q1;2015
"This paper highlights some of the results of the study carried out by the authors within the research project ""Integrated system for innovation management in SMEs"", code PN-II-PT-PCCA-2013-4-1319, under way at the Business Administration Research Centre of the Bucharest University of Economic Studies. The objective aimed at was to show the progress made by Romanian SMEs in adopting the open innovation principles. In order to reach this objective, the authors analysed the available statistical data for the period 2002-2012 concerning the trend of the SMEs' weight in the total innovation businesses compared to the weight of the large companies, the trend of the number of innovation projects started but unfinished or abandoned, and the trend of the ratio between the weight of the expenses on internal innovation activities and the expenses on external innovation activities for these businesses. The performed study highlighted the fact that within the analysed period, the weight of innovative SMEs in the total SMEs doubled. Within the same period of time the number of Romanian SMEs that initiated research-development-innovation projects unfinished and/or abandoned went up significantly, which proves that the initiatives of these businesses in developing ever more complex and riskier research projects multiplied. Under these circumstances, the authors' opinion is that focus is needed on external innovation sources that are typical to open innovation, with an important role in enhancing the performance of the innovation process.";3;Business;Ref465;Q2;2015
The concept of open innovation has recently gained wide academic attention, as it seems to have significant impact for company performance. Most empirical investigations about this emerging concept have been case studies of successful early adopters of open innovation, and their analyses have largely been at the company level. Although case studies at that level provide meaningful implications, the new phenomena merit a more in-depth examination: that is, we need to collect and analyze data on multiple companies to explore more systematic findings about open innovations across companies. Moreover, analyses may need to go down to the individual project rather than the whole company level because innovation activities are often conducted as part of research and development (R&D) projects. To meet these needs, this study examines companies' open innovation efforts at the level of the individual R&D project. Specifically, the present study focuses on project-level openness to better understand the mechanisms of open innovation. It explores systematic relationships between various antecedent factors and the degree of openness. Project-level openness could be affected by team and task characteristics, such as team size, learning distance, strategic importance, technology and market uncertainty, and relevance to the main business. Relevant data collected from 303 companies in Korea were used to identify the antecedents that affect inbound and outbound openness. The research findings are expected to help provide a concrete theoretical framework suited for more generalized application and further practical development of open innovation strategy.;3;Business;Ref466;Q1;2015
The concept of open innovation has attracted a lot of interest over the past decade. In light of a relative emphasis on inbound open innovation (indicating an outside-in process) in prior research, this brief note addresses the relationship between outbound open innovation (indicating an inside-out process) and firm performance. In particular, it suggests that outbound open innovation may have positive and negative effects on firm performance based on potential benefits and risks of transferring technology. To what degree these effects materialize depends on internal factors, e.g. desorptive capacity, and external factors, e.g. appropriability. Consequently, a proficient internal management of outbound open innovation is critical to avoid its potential risks and to capture its substantial benefits. In this regard, future research may substantially deepen the insights into the relevance and role of outbound open innovation.;3;Business;Ref467;Q1;2015
Open firms are not equally successful. This is because, in order to benefit from external sources of knowledge, firms must be able to absorb such knowledge. The paper outlines a firm's context as a set of organizational and social features, which may be considered absorptive capacity antecedents. It explores the mediating role of such antecedents in the relationship - hitherto insufficiently researched - between the degree of openness and innovative performance. The use of a methodology combining both direct interviews and survey of Italian firms has allowed us to confirm the supposed mediating role. We also identify different modes for companies to open up their innovation process and, for each of them, the antecedents that are consistent with choices regarding the degree of openness.;3;Business;Ref468;Q1;2015
Our exploratory empirical study, based on interviews and a survey of firms, addresses a number of questions on the role of formal contracts and intellectual property rights (IPR) in the context of firm-to-firm open innovation (OI). We find that firms active in OI have a very strong preference for the governance of their OI relationships with other firms through formal contracts. Also, despite the open nature of OI, firms still see IPR as highly relevant to the protection of their innovative capabilities. We find the degree of openness of firms, their formal legal attitude, and the competitive dynamics of their product market environment to be related to the preference of OI firms for IPR. Furthermore, the strength of firms' internal R&D capabilities increases the positive relationship between openness and the preference for IPR.;3;Business;Ref469;Q2;2015
This study examines a number of environmental determinants (government supported developments, financial resources, academic-industry collaborations and market dynamics) in supporting innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises in the emerging Dubai market in the United Arab Emirates. The results from a survey of 200 senior managers highlight the importance of government supported developments and market dynamics on innovation in these firms, although do not support the expected influence of financial resources and academic and industry collaborations. The implication is that innovation should be linked to the local economic development and supported by specific policies and programs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Academics and practitioners have demonstrated that open innovation is critical to superior performance; firms thereby connect their in-house R&D functions with external partners to enhance their innovation activities. This study extends the open innovation theory and the knowledge-based view to explain how a firm's external knowledge resource acquisition influences its innovation deployment as well as its performance. Specifically, we argue that technology scouting plays an important role as an antecedent to collaboration with horizontal and vertical technology acquisitions. Furthermore, the horizontal technology collaboration and vertical technology collaboration play mediators in determining firm performance returns from executing such acquisitions. Based on a large-scale survey of high-tech firms, the study finds that the ability to build well-developed external connection channels increases the efficacy of inbound open innovation in achieving superior performance.

Open innovation (OI) denotes a company's ability to draw on a range of external sources to meet their needs for innovation. Very few empirical analyses have been conducted on the extent to which this new paradigm is embedded in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Thus, the present study's objective is to identify and characterize different profiles of OI in SMEs, considering the openness of the innovation process phases, variety and breadth of collaborations, determinants, barriers, and motivations. A survey was carried out among Italian SME manufacturing firms, and a database of 105 companies was obtained. With regard to data elaboration, a factorial and cluster analysis was conducted, and three different OI profiles emerged: selective low open, unselective open upstream, and mid-partners integrated open. The different behaviors of the three clusters in terms of determinants, performance, contextual factors, barriers, and motivations were analyzed and discussed.;3;Business;Ref472;Q1;2015
In this paper we explore how small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engage in external knowledge sourcing, a form of inbound open innovation. We draw upon a sample of 1,411 SMEs and empirically conceptualize a typology of strategic types of external knowledge sourcing, namely minimal, supply-chain, technology-oriented, application-oriented, and full-scope sourcing. Each strategy reflects the nature of external interactions and is linked to a distinct mixture of four internal practices for managing innovation. Both full-scope and application-oriented sourcing offer performance benefits and are associated with a stronger focus on managing innovation.

Open government initiatives in the U.S. government focus on three main aspects: transparency, participation, and collaboration. Especially the collaboration mandate is relatively unexplored in the literature. In practice, government organizations recognize the need to include external problem solvers into their internal innovation creation processes. This is partly derived from a sense of urgency to improve the efficiency and quality of government service delivery. Another formal driver is the America Competes Act that instructs agencies to search for opportunities to meaningfully promote excellence in technology, education, and science. Government agencies are responding to these requirements by using open innovation (OI) approaches to invite citizens to crowdsource and peer produce solutions to public management problems. These distributed innovation processes occur at all levels of the U.S. government and it is important to understand what design elements are used to create innovative public management ideas. This article systematically reviews existing government crowdsourcing and peer production initiatives and shows that after agencies have defined their public management problem, they go through four different phases of the OI process: (1) idea generation through crowdsourcing, (2) incubation of submitted ideas with peer voting and collaborative improvements of favorite solutions, (3) validation with a proof of concept of implementation possibilities, and (4) reveal of the selected solution and the (internal) implementation of the winning idea. Participation and engagement are incentivized both with monetary and nonmonetary rewards, which lead to tangible solutions as well as intangible innovation outcomes, such as increased public awareness.;5;Computer;Ref474;Q1;2015
"The classical model of innovation behind closed doors is slowly but surely being challenged by the Open Innovation model that is reshaping the way organizations bring new products and services into the market. This paper reports on the results of an International Space University (ISU) Team Project (TP) focused on the potential, limitations and conditions of success of Open Innovation in the space sector using ISU's international, interdisciplinary, intercultural (3Is) approach. Open Innovation can be defined as ""the process of strategically managing the sharing of ideas and resources among entities to co-create value"". Conventional approaches to technology development for space, such as spin-offs or spin-ins, are no longer sufficient to fully describe the interactions between organizations in today's Research and Development (R&D) landscape. Traditionally, conducting space technology development and launching space missions required massive infrastructure investments, long lead times and large teams of experts. However, internal R&D, dedicated marketing departments and closely guarded intellectual property are no longer the only way to achieve success. Smaller, nimbler teams, significant use of crowdfunding, a more aggressive approach to managing risk and a great motivation to leverage intellectual property are just some of their defining characteristics. By using a case study methodology focused on asteroid mining supported by a critical literature review, the project team highlighted the potential of Open Innovation in space by identifying its most promising applications as well as its limitations.

Most existing studies on the global information technology (IT) sector examine the causal relationship between internally generated patents and corporate performance. However, global IT companies acquire patents not only from internal research and development (R&D), but also from inbound open innovation. Focusing on this, we examine the differential effects of patents from various sources, including (1) internal R&D, (2) university-industry collaboration, and (3) transaction on corporate sales, profits, and market value in 28 global IT companies. We find that patents by internal R&D boost sales, profits, and corporate value. Purchased patents have small, immediate positive effects on market value and profit, but do not increase sales. University-industry collaboration patents drive sales after more than two years, but negatively impact market value. Overall, internal R&D is consistently important for sustainable corporate growth, implying that the acquisition of ideas, technologies, and human resources for internal R&D is the most effective method of inbound open innovation. Purchased patents boost short-term growth, while university-industry collaboration is necessary for mid- and long-term growth. Our study provides the basis for an optimal balance between internal R&D and inbound open innovation, as well as the creation of a financial performance-oriented patent portfolio.;3;Business;Ref476;Q3;2015
Research suggests that cultural issues can make or mar the open innovation process. In this paper, we thus aim at identifying organizational culture types that enable and retard the two types of open innovation activities: in-bound and out-bound. Data were collected using the questionnaire survey method from 339 middle and top managers working in the Malaysian high-tech sector. Organizational culture emerged as a huge predictor of open innovation. We found that highly integrative culture enables in-bound open innovation, but does not significantly affect out-bound open innovation. Besides, hierarchy culture is found to retard both in-bound and out-bound open innovation. This paper is probably the first to empirically investigate the role of culture in open innovation. The findings fill an important gap in open innovation theory while practical implications extend to managers interested in open innovation adoption in their organizations.;19;Social;Ref477;Q2;2015
While 'open innovation' is often considered to be an organisational strategy with universal application, its generalisability and applicability to organisations operating within emerging economies has yet to be fully explored. This study provides empirical evidence of its importance within a substantial sample of Chinese large firms and small and medium enterprises. Using Tobit regression analysis, our findings indicate that external knowledge sources from inter-firm networking are more important in creating the benefits of open innovation for Chinese small and medium enterprises than their larger peers. Linkages to university and research institutes generally have few direct effects on the innovation performance of both large and small firms in China. However, the role of universities and research institutes is shown to be important among our large firm sample when combined with evident internal absorptive capacity. This interaction is generally limited to our large firm sample, and is not as evident among small firms. Our study indicates that the barriers to the adoption of open innovation by Chinese firms might be largely related to the comparatively weak domestic research expertise and limited organisational absorptive capabilities, with this most particularly evident for small and medium enterprises. These findings suggest that, based on this evidence, there is no need for emerging economies like China to mimic the emergence path from closed to open innovation followed by developed countries. Chinese firms will be more likely to garner the benefits available from openness when they develop the capabilities required to identify, assimilate and commercialise knowledge and technologies obtained from external sources.;3;Business;Ref478;Q2;2015
The concept of open innovation has attracted considerable attention since Henry Chesbrough first coined it to capture the increasing reliance of firms on external sources of innovation. Although open innovation has flourished as a topic within innovation management research, it has also triggered debates about the coherence of the research endeavors pursued under this umbrella, including its theoretical foundations. In this paper, we aim to contribute to these debates through a bibliometric review of the first decade of open innovation research. We combine two techniques-bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis-to (1) visualize the network of publications that explicitly use the label 'open innovation' and (2) to arrive at distinct clusters of thematically related publications. Our findings illustrate that open innovation research builds principally on four related streams of prior research, whilst the bibliographic network of open innovation research reveals that seven thematic clusters have been pursued persistently. While such persistence is undoubtedly useful to arrive at in-depth and robust insights, the observed patterns also signal the absence of new, emerging, themes. As such, 'open innovation' might benefit from applying its own ideas: sourcing concepts and models from a broader range of theoretical perspectives as well as pursuing a broader range of topics might introduce dynamics resulting in more impact and proliferation.;5;Computer;Ref479;Q1;2015
Open innovation (OI) represents an emergent paradigm by which customers and users are involved as part of the innovation processes of organisations. One of its most popular implementation schemes is OI communities, which have been popularised by the use of social software. Through these communities, users are free to post, share, comment and evaluate other users' ideas, and they can interact with other users as well as with the innovation department and experts of the organisation. One of the challenges of OI communities is distinguishing the most innovative ideas, as they receive hundreds or even thousands of ideas. This paper proposes a novel approach for this task consisting of analysing the content of shared ideas. Through this analysis, several conclusions about the decision processes of the organisation can be inferred. The obtained results can help OI managers to improve ideas evaluation processes.;3;Business;Ref480;Q2;2015
"This paper aims at investigating the relationships between the adoption of open innovation by companies and their context features, internal R&D, and financial performances. Two proxies for openness-variety and intensity-are defined, and six hypotheses are formulated and tested on a sample of 68 worldwide top R&D spending pharmaceutical companies. The period of 2008-2012 was analyzed for a total of 340 statistical units. Our results suggest that open innovation is a very pervasive behavior among smaller and younger companies, for which internal R&D is complementary to openness; still being in the development phase, they derive most of their revenues from open innovation itself and show negative financial performances. Yet, a wider range of open transactions are performed by larger and longer established firms, exhibiting good financial performances and adopting open innovation as a substitution to internal R&D efforts. Through an in-depth review of the literature, this paper contributes to the research on open innovation by providing an accounting measurement system, testing six hypotheses among open innovation and some firm-level variables, and positioning the obtained results within the current debate.";3;Business;Ref481;Q1;2015
This study examines the current state of the art in the emerging and strategically important marine biotechnology sector in Oman, which has a long coastline, rich marine heritage and strong fishing industry. In a knowledge-based economy, the ability to innovate is a key factor for increasing organisational competitiveness and this may be achieved using open innovation. This is the use by firms of external knowledge, ideas and technology to innovate. In this study, the extent of open innovation in Omani marine bioindustry companies has been studied by examining data from the top sixteen companies ranked by number of employees. The results indicate that the extent of openness in these companies is higher towards market side activities. In addition, the use of open innovation to increase collaboration between companies, Universities and government research institutes needs to be significantly strengthened. (C) 2015 The Authors.

"Research on open innovation suggests that companies benefit differentially from adopting open innovation strategies; however, it is unclear why this is so. One possible explanation is that companies' business models are not attuned to open strategies. Accordingly, we propose a contingency model of open business models by systematically linking open innovation strategies to core business model dimensions, notably the content, structure, and governance of transactions. We further illustrate a continuum of open innovativeness, differentiating between four types of open business models. We contribute to the open innovation literature by specifying the conditions under which business models are conducive to the success of open innovation strategies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper studies how business models can be designed to tap effectively into open innovation labor markets with heterogeneously motivated workers. Using data on open source software, we show that motivations are diverse, and demonstrate how managers can strategically influence the flow of code contributions and their impact on project performance. Unlike previous literature using survey data, we exploit the observed pattern of project membership and code contributionsthe revealed preference of developersto infer the motivations driving their decision to contribute. Developers strongly sort along key dimensions of the business model chosen by project managers, especially the degree of openness of the project license. The results indicate an important role for intrinsic motivation, reputation, and labor market signaling, and a more limited role for reciprocity.

This paper describes a new business model for advancing NASA human health and performance innovations and demonstrates how open innovation, including the use of crowdsourcing and technology solution sourcing services, shaped its development. A 45 percent research and technology development budget reduction drove formulation of a strategic plan grounded in collaboration. We describe the strategy execution, including adoption and results of open innovation initiatives, the challenges of culture change, and the development of a knowledge management tool to educate and engage the workforce in the new strategy and promote culture change.;3;Business;Ref485;Q1;2015
"Advances in information technology (IT) have enabled firms to increasingly rely on open innovation. Although researchers and practitioners are interested in this phenomenon, there is a lack of theoretically driven research on how IT impacts organizational open innovation performance. Drawing on the strategic IT alignment perspective and related literature, we proposed a model to explain the performance of organizational open innovation; i.e., the alignment between IT strategies and the openness of open innovation strategies results in different outcomes for open innovation. Through the analysis of data from 225 firms in China, we found that the alignment between IT flexibility and breadth enhances innovation radicalness and innovation volume, whereas the alignment between IT integration and depth positively affects innovation volume only. Innovation volume and radicalness were found to enhance organizational performance in terms of sales growth. Our study contributes to the literature on open innovation and strategic alignment. Its findings also have important Managerial implications for practitioners. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.";5;Computer;Ref486;Q1;2015
Nowadays, innovation management paradigm has been changed from internal development to networking and cooperation between Science & Technology network. Open innovation approach is also one of the new approaches of new innovation management that has modified internal research and development suppositions to research and development through cooperation. Accessing an appropriate technological environment and continuous awareness require various tools and methods. One of these tools is monitoring of this technological environment by the use of technology intelligence system. The purpose of this study is surveying the effect of open innovation approach on technology intelligence application in Iran's aviation industry. The sampling method in this article is the stratified sampling of experts from the aviation industry, which includes 81 experts, managers of industrial and researching institutions, designers and superior designers, managers of repairing and maintenance, and a Private company (Aviation Union members). The tool for data gathering is a questionnaire that has been used according to validation of the content validity by experts of industry and academic. In the present research, two standard models, Savioz (2004) for measuring technology intelligence and Hafkerbink (2010) for measuring open innovation approach, have been used. Results show that these two elements can be applied exclusively in organisation for technology trend analysis and technology or idea acquisition approach. Finally, the relationship between the concepts of open innovation and intelligence was investigated.;3;Business;Ref487;Q2;2015
"To foster sustainable regional development, many regions rely on innovations. To safeguard the generation of innovations and their market introduction, companies have increasingly used technology roadmapping and open innovation. The project INNOrural (Innovations for sustainable rural development) expanded these concepts by applying them to regions. This led to the rise of the ""Regional Open Innovation Roadmapping"" framework for innovation-based regional development (ROIR). This framework was tested by conducting two innovation roadmapping processes in the model region of Markisch-Oderland (MOL), Germany: the certification of regional wood fuel and the establishment of a competence center for precision farming technology. Both innovation ideas were selected during the roadmapping process by applying a sustainability assessment. After 12 months, two complete roadmaps were ready for implementation. Key principles of ROIR were identified, including the use of a clear and replicable sustainability assessment method, the involvement of all relevant stakeholder groups in the early process and the cooperation between regional and subject experts. Generally, the broader adaptation of ROIR for additional regions will be useful. Nevertheless, the ROIR processes need to be evaluated in depth to develop a better understanding and to provide evidence of the benefits and limitations of this approach.";18;Computer;Ref488;Q2;2015
The paper suggests a methodology for measuring the degree of openness in companies' innovation processes through the analysis of annual reports. Four openness dimensions are defined based on costs and revenues deriving from open innovation activities and new investments and divestments of innovation-related intangibles, occurring in either separate acquisitions or business combinations. A synthetic measure of openness is defined, including all the four dimensions. The model is then applied to a sample of 126 global top R&D spending companies in the bio-pharmaceutical industry for the period 2008-2012, for a total of 630 annual reports analysed. Results show a negative correlation of openness degree with firm age, dimension and efficiency, with biotech companies being more open than pharmaceutical ones. The paper contributes to the research on open innovation by suggesting a comprehensive framework for the measure of the pecuniary dimension of the phenomenon in both inbound and outbound processes. From a managerial point of view, the framework can be used by companies to both monitor their own degree of openness and to benchmark it with those of competitors.;3;Business;Ref489;Q1;2015
The purpose of the paper is to illuminate the costs and benefits of crossing firm boundaries in inbound open innovation (OI) by determining the relationships among partner types, knowledge content and performance. The empirical part of the study is based on a survey of OI collaborations answered by R&D managers in 415 Italian, Finnish and Swedish firms. The results show that the depth of collaboration with different partners (academic/consultants, value chain partners, competitors and firms in other industries) is positively related to innovation performance, whereas the number of different partners and size have negative effects. The main result is that the knowledge content of the collaboration moderates the performance outcomes and the negative impact of having too many different kinds of partners. This illustrates how successful firms use selective collaboration strategies characterized by linking explorative and exploitative knowledge content to specific partners, to leverage the benefits and limit the costs of knowledge boundary crossing processes.;3;Business;Ref490;Q1;2015
This study investigates the effects of the use of social media in inbound open innovation on capabilities for absorptive capacity of companies. Seven explorative case studies were conducted in an R&D and business context of two large global high-tech companies. The results suggest that if the necessary conditions are met, social media usage increases the transparent, moderational and multi-directional interactions that in turn influence four capabilities for absorptive capacity: connectedness, socialization tactics, cross-functionality and receptivity, a hitherto overlooked capability. Hence, we observe that social media are boundary-spanning tools that can be used to build and increase companies' absorptive capacity.;3;Business;Ref491;Q1;2015
While current research commonly finds there may be an optimum overall level of search depth commitment at the apex of an inverted U relationship, it says comparatively little about the optimal allocation of search depth between competing search channels. Neither does it explore in depth the qualitative differences in the breadth of different external search channels. Here we conceptually and empirically explore the idea of the intra-search channel allocation problem using the concept of heterogeneity in search depth and breadth. We explore how variations in the distribution of open innovation search depth and breadth influnence innovation performance and in doing so contribute to a more fine grained conceptual understanding of external innovation. We do so an emerging market context, namely China. Our contributions are therefore twofold, involving both conceptual and empirical elements.;3;Business;Ref492;Q2;2015
This paper explores the role of centrality and structural holes positions on the likelihood to develop new products and the moderating role of the open innovation flow, a measure of the net knowledge flow crossing the firm's boundaries, on the aforementioned relation. We argue that network positions provide the information content to the firm, whilst open innovation flow describes how the firm uses such content, thus the combination of these two concepts has a significant impact on new product development. We test the theoretical framework on a large sample of 544 public companies and data from 1758 agreements among 1890 bio-pharmaceutical firms through the period 2006-2010. Our results show that being centrally located in the network positively affects the new product development process, while having a structural holes position has no effect on the aforementioned performance. However, the interaction of the two network positions with the open innovation flow has a positive impact on the likelihood to develop new products. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

"Purpose - This study aims to examine the potential impact of external complementary resources on inbound open innovation and whether transformative capacity acts as a mediator in the process. If small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are to successfully implement inbound open innovation, they require injections of external complementary resources. Design/methodology/approach - Structural equation modeling was used to conduct confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate measurement model, while ordinary least squares regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses; research data are collected using surveys of 200 Taiwanese-owned SMEs in mainland China. Findings - Empirical results indicate that when SMEs seek to implement inbound open innovation, technological complementarity is the most important factor in resource complementarity. In addition, transformative capacity has a significant mediating role on the relationship between resource complementarity and inbound open innovation. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper lies in explaining the role played by transformative capacity in the process of inbound open innovation for SMEs through empirical analysis.";3;Business;Ref494;Q1;2015
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the long-term financial effects of open innovation in the manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing upon an open innovation literature, this study examined 671 open innovation announcements made by firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations during 2003-2012. By employing the event study, the long-term financial performances of the firms that announced open innovation were measured using six dependent performance variables (ROA, ROS, Tobin's Q, Cost ratio, Sales growth, Asset turnover). Findings - The results indicate that open innovation in the manufacturing industry may lead to long-term improvements in firm profitability, triggering a positive reaction by stockholders. Open innovation also decreased production costs and increased sales volume over the long run. In all, open innovation was found to be beneficial to the firm in terms of profitability, production process improvement, and market benefits. Originality/value - This paper is the first longitudinal empirical study to investigate the long-term effects of open innovation in terms of US manufacturing financial performance. It contributes to the body of knowledge by complementing previous open innovation studies, which generally focus on context-specific issues.;3;Business;Ref495;Q1;2015
"Purpose - The internal resources of a firm should not be regarded as the only source of innovation; organizations need to look at the external sources which can contribute greatly. This can happen through the recent development in technologies and the emergence of social media; such advancements have empowered consumers to have social interaction with their peers in online communities. As a source of generation of innovative ideas, company-based communities have not received enough attention, although they are strong drivers for co-creation of value by customers. Easy online communication channels, facilitated through online communities, have developed open innovation as an attractive means of customer involvement in value creation. However, literature in this area is devoid of empirical research on the way consumers can participate in open innovation communities using Web 2.0 technologies. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - This paper, therefore, looks at the opportunities offered by social media to firms for open innovation in the context of new product development (NPD). The study is based on social support theory and the concept of social media generating open innovation; a model for the research has thus been proposed. The model has been tested using partial least square through an online questionnaire. Findings - The results indicate that social media is a cost-efficient way for firms to look at external sources of innovation, specifically in NPD. Online communities, developed specifically for new products, can support the innovation process for the business sector. The paper discusses the results of this empirical research and has some practical implications for practitioners in this field. Originality/value - The study indicate that social media empower individuals to come online, get involved in social interaction and share their experiences about a new product with other peers in the network. Social media and informational support, as social capital of online communities, both have influence on participation of individuals in the online communities of open innovation for NPD.";5;Computer;Ref496;Q1;2015
Purpose - Despite extensive published research into the relationship between open innovation (OI) activities and performance, the nature and direction of the relationship remain inconclusive. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship as to how firms' inbound and outbound OI activities, as well as their interaction influence incremental and radical innovation performance. The authors also consider the potentially mediating roles of knowledge learning and organizational capabilities in such a relationship. Design/methodology/approach - To investigate this relationship, data were collected from a cross-industry survey of 304 leading Taiwanese-based firms. Three-stage least square analysis was employed to test the model. Findings - Analyses reveal that knowledge learning and organizational capabilities mediate the OI activities-innovation performance relationship. In addition, a firm focussing on inbound activities enhances its radical innovation performance, but hinders its incremental innovation performance, while focussing on outbound activities produces the opposite effects. Among the findings, it is worth emphasizing that the effect of the interaction between inbound and outbound activities on innovation performance can be counter-productive. Research limitations/implications - The findings demonstrate that existing studies only partially explain the effects of OI activities on innovation performance. Understanding how OI activities influence innovation performance will facilitate more informed decision making, leading to more effective use of OI activities. Practical implications - The results suggest that managers need to consider knowledge learning and organizational capabilities in order to fully capture the potential effects of OI activities. Managers also need to be aware of the limitations of OI activities. Originality/value - The theoretical model presented here offers a timely contribution to the theory base underpinning the development of OI activities for innovation performance.;3;Business;Ref497;Q1;2015
The degree of openness in innovation is a key strategic decision of family firms (FFs). Although there is an increased interest in studies on FFs and open innovation (OI), the existing knowledge is rather limited. This study explores the determinants of OI in FFs. We focus on two distinctive types of FFs: those held and managed by family members and FFs where ownership and management are disjointed, leading to non-family managers being involved in strategic decision-making. Our study shows that FFs managed by non-family managers are motivated by an innovation strategy that is more aggressive, more oriented towards technological excellence and radical innovation as compared to FFs managed by family managers. And they are more likely to search for a broader set of external sources in embracing OI. We argue that the presence of non-family managers is what makes the difference in shaping firm behaviour in terms of OI breadth.;3;Business;Ref498;Q1;2015
This study presents a case study research that sets out the process of designing the Dominican Republic's RDI strategy during the period 2001-2007 and the role played by international cooperation in that process. We discussed the Triple Helix model as framework, and the use of a new approach that can be transferred to other countries. The results have validated some of the model's assumptions, but they have also confirmed the existence of certain explanatory limitations in it. In order to rectify them, a new model - the Global Open Innovation model - has been proposed as alternative approach to the innovation transfer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines how R&D intensity and open innovation affect the technological capabilities of firms in newly-developed countries, such as South Korea. East Asian latecomers are transitioning from a catch-up phase toward becoming leaders, and they are engaging in open innovation activities to drive this transition. This research quantitatively analyzes three kinds of open innovation activities-outside-in, inside-out, and coupled-to investigate their influence upon technological capabilities, while also considering the effect of R&D intensity. Data from 75 South Korean medium-sized firms were analyzed, and two major findings are reported. First, technological capabilities are enhanced by some open innovation activities and by R&D intensity. Second, R&D intensity negatively moderates the impact of open innovation activities on technological capabilities. Therefore, it may be concluded that firms with relatively low R&D intensity will gain the most benefit from increasing their open innovation activities.;8;Engineering;Ref500;Q2;2015
Purpose - By increasing connectivity between multiple partners, the new paradigm of open innovation has been argued to stimulate creativity. However, there are still few empirical studies exploring what influence this new form of organizing for innovation has on the creative climate. The purpose of this paper is to start filling that knowledge gap by exploring the creative climate in an open innovation arena called SAFER, where 26 partner organizations meet to innovate together. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a mixed method consisting of a quantitative creative climate questionnaire complemented by qualitative data gathering through interviews. Findings - The findings suggest that the networking and cross-functional meetings within the arena are beneficial to facilitate a creative climate, but there are challenges in handling uncertainties such as work identities, information sharing and knowledge transparency. Practical implications - The arena is found to be rather dependent on interaction with the outside environment, implying that a well-constructed arena from an organizational point of view is in itself not enough to ensure a creative climate. The project organization of the arena makes the general perception of SAFER fragmented, and it is questioned whether such an arena could or should strive for only one creative climate. Originality/value - The paper presents an interesting example of how introducing open innovation affects the creative climate, and discusses the difficulty of using established methods for assessing the creative climate in the new, emerging forms of organizing for innovation.;3;Business;Ref501;Q2;2015
"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a better understanding of what Open Innovation means within university context. Focus is also put on the role universities believe they should play in Open Innovation, as well as the changes that might have arisen as a consequence of universities' greater awareness of this concept. Design/methodology/approach - The research methodology used is an exploratory study based on in-depth semi-structured interviews of Pro-Vice-Chancellors (or equivalent level) of a variety of British universities. The study was designed around five main research themes: discourse, change, strategy, management, Open Innovation success. Findings - In addition to the traditional teaching, research and knowledge transfer roles of university, this study has uncovered a new role of universities: trusted intermediary (or ""Open Innovation Hub""). Another key finding of this study is that it highlights the diversity that prevails in the UK with regard to Open Innovation. Research limitations/implications - The number of the interviews conducted for this study is probably not large enough to allow a solid generalisation. Data saturation, however, was achieved in this study. The insight provided by this study is particularly significant as interviewees were amongst the highest-ranking executives in their respective universities. Hence the views reported in this study are what ""drives"" Open Innovation policies in the universities that participated in this study. Practical implications - This new role of a trusted intermediary played by universities is very likely to change the existing Open Innovation landscape and re-shape policies. Social implications - The changing role of universities within Open Innovation context may potentially change the respective role of other stakeholders in the Open Innovation ecosystem. Originality/value - This is the first study aimed at investigating how British universities understand Open Innovation and what opportunities and challenges they associate with this process.";3;Business;Ref502;Q2;2015
Web 2.0 has considerably increased the possibilities of user involvement in the production process and, thereby, has given rise to new forms of co-creation (open innovation with customers). Because the roles of consumers, now 'prosumers', have radically changed, specific challenges have emerged. The aim of this article is to provide possible routes to address such challenges. To do so, an input-output typology of co-creation is created. This typology is then used to discuss the main challenges of co-creation: incentives, risks and costs, IPRs.;8;Engineering;Ref503;Q1;2015
Prior research on open innovation primarily focused on theoretical perceptions about the transaction of technologies in information technology, pharmaceutical and electronics industry. Research about open innovation in the automotive industry has hardly received attention. However, the automotive industry has long been cooperating with external partners and nowadays acquires about three quarters of the value created from their suppliers. Based on theoretical findings of other industries, we examine the role of technology transactions and external partnerships in fostering firm capabilities. Survey responses from the German automotive industry let us empirically test seven hypotheses with a multiple regression model. Based on a firm's individual resource configuration and capability level, results show that some firms clearly profit more from openness than others. With this study, we extend research about open innovation in an industry where it has not been done before and empirically test the concept to overcome the prescriptive character of recent research on open innovation.;8;Engineering;Ref504;Q1;2015
Companies have traditionally considered innovation an internal process, and accordingly, they have relied on their internal intellectual capital. However, this closed innovation strategy has, in recent years, been superseded by an open innovation strategy. The existing measurement model of intellectual capital, which is concerned mainly with an internal dimension, is no longer appropriate for open innovation practice. To address this challenge, this paper reconstructs the measurement model of intellectual capital, expanding the concept to include both internal and external dimensions, both of which have the same three elements: human, structural, and relationship capital. To test the reliability and validity of this new model, we explore the impact of each element on innovation performance through an empirical study of 149 companies in China, and we find that all elements of internal and external intellectual capital have a significantly positive impact on innovation performance. This implies that our new measurement is appropriate for firms with an increasing degree of openness for innovation.;8;Engineering;Ref505;Q1;2015
Purpose - Open innovation is an emerging paradigm which exposes organisations to networked capabilities and competencies though collaboration relationships. The traditional view of the organisational environment raises concerns regarding the mismatch in the methods used to assess business value and understanding service process maturity. The purpose of this paper is to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach - This paper employs a systematic literature review to present a state-of-the-art literature review with particular focus on the applicability of capability maturity models (CMM) within an open innovation context. Findings - The authors present a conceptual account of our research developments and build on the state-of-the-art which bridges open innovation and CMM. The authors provide a comprehensive discussion on the literature and challenge the applicability of individual organisations evolving through maturity stages. The authors identify a significant gap in the emergence of open innovation and CMM and present a service capability sourcing model (SCSM) to bridge theses this two research areas. Practical implications - Unpacking the nature of service capabilities allows us to understand the primary components of value co-creation and their contribution towards service maturity within an open service innovation environment. The authors verify the explanation model using a cloud computing scenario within an open service innovation environment. Originality/value - The contribution of this paper is an explanation model of an open service innovation environment through our SCSM.

Our study investigates the outbound open innovation of firms engaged in technological venturing. Leveraging insights from the sociology theory and innovation literatures, we clarify whether social status helps entrepreneurial ventures overcome market imperfection and information asymmetry in out-licensing and illustrate the importance of specific aspects of social status building in this context. We also examine the effect of failure experiences on out-licensing. We take a dynamic view of desorptive capacity by studying an entrepreneurial venture's learning process, both internally, in terms of its own technology trajectory, and externally, through inter-organizational alliances. We apply a negative binomial model to our novel panel of 180 firms studied over an 18-year period with controls for stocks of clinical development activities, patenting and prior licensing activities. Empirical analysis enables us to observe the impact which the firms' technological and development status, reputation and desorptive capacity exert upon out-licensing volume. Prior outbound open innovation studies do not account for the heterogeneity of technology and R&D success and failure experiences observed in our study. We also demonstrate the contingency effect of external learning from alliances during the building-up of a firm's desorptive capacity, or the way in which the number of co-authoring partners in scientific publications negatively moderates the positive effect of the number of commercial alliances on the volume of its out-licensing deals. Our findings contribute to the understanding of external knowledge exploitation and complement important aspects of the literatures on outbound open innovation and desorptive capacity, offering empirically rich insights for bin-pharmaceutical firms into the drivers behind volumes of out-licensing deals.

We determine the impact of the macro-design of a firm's alliance portfolio on its open-innovation effectiveness. Three elements of macro-design-international, technological, and partner diversity-are theorized to affect the breadth of knowledge sourcing, which is an important facet of open-innovation effectiveness. We test our hypotheses on a sample of 982 firm-years in the biotech industry. We find a U-shaped relationship between knowledge-sourcing breadth and international diversity. We also find that that technological diversity has no impact on knowledge-sourcing breadth. Furthermore, when seeking valuable knowledge, partner diversity is detrimental to knowledge-sourcing breadth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;3;Business;Ref508;Q1;2014
Open innovation often requires wholesale changes to the nature of R&D. However, academic research and managerial practice have paid little attention to the challenges that individuals face in the daily pursuit of open innovation. As a result there is little understanding of how individuals cope with open innovation, and which organizational practices can support them in this role. Drawing on the experiences of R&D professionals, this article identifies four specific challenges and coping strategies of individuals engaged in open innovation. It proposes a range of open innovation practices that organizations can implement to better equip their staff to undertake effective external engagement.;3;Business;Ref509;Q1;2014
Open innovation is increasingly important for researchers and practitioners alike. Open innovation is closely linked to knowledge creation in that, with open innovation, knowledge inflows and outflows are exploited for innovation. In the information systems field, open innovation has been closely linked to open source software development teams. However, the literature has not yet identified how open source software development teams use information technologies to create knowledge to bring about open innovation. This study fills in this gap by asking the following research questions: RQ1) How do innovative open source software development teams create knowledge?, and RQ2) What types of information technologies do innovative open source software development teams rely on for enabling knowledge creation? I answer these research questions with a revelatory case study. The findings contribute to the knowledge management theory by identifying how three of the four knowledge creation modes identified by Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) manifest through different behaviors in the IT-enabled open innovation setting compared to behaviors observed in the organizational setting. The findings also contribute to information systems theory by identifying the role of information technologies in enabling knowledge creation for open innovation. This study further provides researchers and practitioners with ways of identifying knowledge creation by analyzing information technology artifacts, such as mailing lists, issue trackers, and software versioning tools.;5;Computer;Ref510;Q1;2014
"A change in U.S. patent law in the early 1980s increased the value of patents, particularly for firms in the electronics and semiconductors industry, yet many of the industry's leading firms did not embrace patenting after the change. We show through an in-depth study of International Business Machines (IBM), the world's largest patentee, that the company's practices during much of the 1980s discouraged patenting. IBM adopted pro-patent management practices in 1989 after the installation of a new research and development head and in the face of faltering financial performance. IBM's increased patenting and licensing activities improved its financial bottom lines but curtailed its industry-wide knowledge spillovers. These causes and consequences of pro-patent practices are visible in several other large U. S. corporations. Thus, in the context of the ""patent explosion"" of the 1980s, we show that intraorganizational forces such as inertia, financial pressures, and new leadership shaped established firms' uptake of pro-patent management practices and their success. Our findings also suggest that pro-patent practices associated with ""open innovation"" may stem the free flow of knowledge across organizational boundaries.";3;Business;Ref511;Q1;2014
This paper explores the links between open innovation and the emergence of a 'phoenix industry' centred on the UK's traditional automotive heartland, the West Midlands, which has developed a significant presence in automotive design and engineering, particularly among small and niche firms. Drawing on case study research, the paper investigates whether this can be considered as a phoenix industry, and to what extent open innovation has been important in the industry's development. The paper considers relationships between firms and impacts in terms of changing economic and labour market conditions. The paper concludes by examining the role that public policy has played to date and might play in the future in supporting an emerging phoenix industry with open innovation features.;6;Development;Ref512;Q1;2014
"Various scholars have accomplished a great deal to better understand open innovation effectiveness. Case studies have detailed its performance effects, while other studies showed the effectiveness of an aspect of open innovation, such as collaboration with third parties, external technology commercialization, and cocreation. Though most studies report a positive relation between open innovation and innovation performance, some studies indicate possible negative effects. This has resulted in a call for research on what kind of organizational context suits open innovation best. This study therefore addresses two questions: (1) does performing open innovation activities lead to increased innovation performance, and to which aspects of innovation performance is open innovation most strongly related? (2) what is the moderating impact of various kinds of strategic orientation on the relation between open innovation and innovation performance? In this study, we investigate three types of strategic orientations: entrepreneurial orientation, market orientation, and resource orientation. In a survey among 223 Asian service firms, we first develop and test a comprehensive measurement scale for open innovation that captures the entire range of open innovation activities, including outside-in activities, inside-out activities, and coupled activities. The final scale comprises of 10 items and indicates to what extent a firm has implemented open innovation activities. Next, we study the relation between open innovation and innovation performance. The results indicate that performing open innovation activities is significantly and positively related to all four dimensions of innovation performance: new product/service innovativeness, new product/service success, customer performance, and financial performance. The impact of open innovation is not limited to a particular aspect of innovation performance; it positively affects a broad range of innovation performance indicators. Though open innovation is positively related to all four dimensions of innovation performance, the effect sizes are not equal. The impact on new service innovativeness and financial performance is relatively stronger. Regarding the influence of a firm's strategic orientation, we find that all significant moderation effects are positive. This suggests that, in general, having a more explicit strategic orientation enhances the effectiveness of open innovation. When comparing the three strategic orientations, entrepreneurial orientation strengthens the positive performance effects of open innovation significantly more than market orientation and resource orientation do. In turn, market orientation has a significantly stronger moderation effect than resource orientation. These findings provide empirical evidence of the context dependency of open innovation. Especially an entrepreneurial orientation, which is associated with proactive and entrepreneurial processes, seems to create a fertile setting for open innovation.";3;Business;Ref513;Q1;2014
The demands of transportation have driven the automobile industry into an innovation race. Uncertain technological trends, long development cycles, highly capital-intensive product development, saturated markets, and environmental and safety regulations have subjected the sector to major transformations. The technological and organisational innovations related to these transformations necessitate research that can enhance our understanding of the characteristics of the new systems. The study investigates the applicability of the Open Innovation concept to a mature capital-intensive asset-based industry - the European automobile industry, which is preparing for a radical technological discontinuity. Purposely selected knowledgeable respondents were interviewed across seven European countries. The findings contribute to the understanding of the CA concept by identifying key obstacles to the wider adoption of the OI model in the European car industry, and signalling the importance of intermediaries and large incumbents for driving network development and OI practices as well as the need of new competencies to be developed by all players.

This article addresses one of the many unexplored challenges associated with closing open innovation the intellectual property (IF) disassembly problem. This is the problem of disentangling and allocating IP rights at the closing or termination of an open innovation project or when one or more of the vital participants leaves. IP disassembly problems may be mitigated (but not eliminated) through contingent contractual provisions at the IP assembly stage. Moreover, provisions can be made at both the assembly and disassembly stages to prepare for and benefit from subsequent IP reassembly in a sequence of project generations over time. An overriding implication is that IF management that addresses both IF assembly and disassembly problems is necessary (although not sufficient) for effective governance of open innovation.;3;Business;Ref515;Q1;2014
"This paper examines the determinants of open innovation as a response to the constraints and risks of innovation that firms face in emerging economies. A recent national firm-level survey of 1,400 firms in the manufacturing sector is used as the basis of the analysis. We find that institutional, financial and knowledge/skills-related risks and constraints are all significantly associated with these firms' depth and breadth of openness in innovation. The responses, however; vary across firms of different ownership types. Foreign-invested firms appear to be most responsive and take action to widen and deepen their openness in innovation. Privately owned firms have made significant responses to market- and institution- and finance- and risk-related impediments but not to knowledge- and skills-related impediments. State-owned firms appear to be least responsive in use of open innovation. Firm size and industry specific effects also appear to have significant moderating effect on firms' responses to the various constraints. These findings are supported by an in-depth study of the Chinese semiconductor industry.";3;Business;Ref516;Q2;2014
An obvious task in open innovation is to find suitable partners for collaboration. In this paper we present results from three participatory case studies of identifying and matching technology firms for collaborative innovation projects. We observe that matchmaking is a more complex process than an (online) market transaction. The cases show how innovation intermediaries organise the matching process as external service-providers and what economic contribution they can have. The paper conceptualises matchmaking for collaborative innovation as economic resource allocation process in the shape of a multi-sided market which involves the innovation partners and intermediaries. The paper concludes with theoretical and practical implications that such a conceptual lens opens for exploratory technology analysis projects and the management of matching processes for innovation partnership formation.;3;Business;Ref517;Q2;2014
Despite the exponential rise of social media use in external stakeholder engagement academic research and managerial practice have paid little attention to how it can be used for open innovation across the entire innovation funnel, spanning ideation, R&D, and commercialization. As a result there is little understanding of how companies can organize for and implement social media for open innovation. Utilizing a multiple case study design, this article examines its application across the entire innovation process. It proposes a range of organizational and technological adaptations that managers can implement to ensure they realize the innovative benefits of social media application.;3;Business;Ref518;Q1;2014
"This paper examines the relationship between (outside-in) open innovation and the financial performance of R&D projects, drawing on a unique dataset that contains information on the open innovation practices, management and performance of 489 R&D projects of a large European multinational firm. We introduce two types of open innovation partnerships - science-based and market-based partnerships and examine their relationships with project financial performance. In addition, we investigate whether the open innovation project performance relationships are influenced by the way how R&D projects are managed. Our results show that R&D projects with open innovation partnerships are associated with a better financial performance providing that they are managed in the most suitable way. Market-based partnerships are positively correlated with project performance if a formal project management process is used; however these partnerships are associated with a lower performance for loosely managed projects. In contrast, science-based partnerships are associated with higher project revenues for loosely managed projects only. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.";3;Business;Ref519;Q1;2014
In an open innovation relationship, the party that owns a key asset enjoys bargaining power that discourages the investments of the other party in the collaboration. We show that these incentives can be restored by conferring on the weak party the power to take decisions during the research process - e.g., a pharmaceutical firm with manufacturing and commercialization assets offers the direction of a joint research project to a biotech partner. However, on many occasions, the strong party still captures more value from the collaboration by retaining the power to take decisions during research even if it produces less innovation value and fewer aggregate profits. We conclude that the potential of open innovation is underexploited. In particular, owners may not release enough power to take decisions on the use of their assets. (C) 2013 Elsevier BM.

"Scholars have recently highlighted the promise of open innovation. In this paper, we treat open innovation in it's different forms and manifestations as well as internal or closed innovation, as unique governance forms with different benefits and costs. We discuss how each governance form, whether open or closed, is composed of a set of instruments that access (a) different types of communication channels for knowledge sharing, (b) different types of incentives, and (c) different types of property rights for appropriating value from innovation. We focus on the innovation ""problem"" as the central unit of analysis, arguing for a match between problem types and governance forms, which vary from open to closed and which support alternative forms of solution search. In all, the goal of this paper is to provide a comparative framework for managing innovation, where we delineate and discuss four categories of open innovation governance forms (markets, partnerships, contests and tournaments and user or community innovation) and compare them with each other and with two internal or closed forms of innovation governance (authority and consensus-based hierarchy).

"The case study provides a history of Chez Panisse and Alice Waters. Throughout Chez Panisse's history, Waters and her team had built a local and now global ecosystem using an ""open innovation"" strategy with stakeholders such as suppliers, alumni chef and staff food writers, and others. The Chez Panisse ecosystem case study uses an open innovation framework to analyze how Chez Panisse grew. The case study allows students to learn how a small firm thrived and became a business success based on building a successful business ecosystem that shares knowledge, encourages individuals' growth, and embeds trust among participants.";3;Business;Ref522;Q1;2014
Open innovation is often facilitated by strong intellectual property rights (IPRs), but it may also function, and even be boosted, when firms deliberately waive some of their IPRs. Extant literature has pointed out the potential benefits of such behavior, but falls short of explaining what triggers firms to practice it in the first place and to maintain or extend it. Since the waiving of IPRs runs counter to common views on strategy and competition and to engrained practices, this is a non-trivial question. To address it, we conduct an empirical study in a segment of the computer component industry which traditionally has taken a rather proprietary stance. With the advent of the open source operating system Linux, firms increasingly waived their IPRs on software drivers. We trace and analyze this process using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Our results indicate that component makers went through a learning process, which led some to realize how selectively waiving IPRs may be beneficial for their business. We uncover customer demand pull as the initial trigger and observe how a positive feedback loop sets in subsequently, leading to a further increase in the use of selective revealing. Overall, we find that openness develops into a new dimension of competition. We discuss the implication of our findings for research on open innovation and highlight how they impact managers in practice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;3;Business;Ref523;Q1;2014
This paper examines the within-industry diversification of software small and medium enterprises that collaborate with the open source software community (OSS SMEs). In doing so, it offers new insights into the association between open innovation and diversification. We rely on arguments inspired by the literature and evidence collected through interviews with OSS SMEs' top managers to investigate factors that favor or hinder within-industry diversification. First, in line with the mainstream diversification literature, we focus attention on the role of firm size. Second, in the spirit of the open innovation research, we concentrate on the mechanisms that OSS SMEs put in place to get access to the external resources of the OSS community. Econometric evidence on 100 European OSS SMEs shows that firm size is negatively associated to within-industry diversification, while OSS SMEs that have contributed to a larger number of OSS projects have a more diversified portfolio of software products. Furthermore, we provide preliminary evidence that the practice of authorizing firm programmers to contribute autonomously to OSS projects of their own choice during working hours may be positively associated to within-industry diversification only if OSS SMEs possess adequate internal technological resources.

The paper studies the relations between open innovation climate and job satisfaction, in particular the causal effects of the various dimensions of open innovation climate on different facets of job satisfaction. We assume firms which pursuing open innovation climate will result in higher level of employee job satisfaction. Both open innovation climate and job satisfaction are assumed to be multidimensional constructs (second-order model). Meanwhile the difference caused by employees' organizational level was also investigated. A partial least squares path model was developed, in which significant effects were discovered. This study provides valuable materials for hoteliers who want to promote open innovation climate in their organizations.;19;Social;Ref525;Q2;2014
"Open innovation has received substantial business attention as a means of providing firms in hyper-competitive environments with the ability to create a stream of new products and services. For open innovation, organizing external sources correctly is a critical capability; current literature suggests that external sources should be organized either as collaborative communities or as competitive markets. While firms have generally been slow to adopt open innovation, many cities in the U.S. and Europe have been quick to embrace it-providing needed field-based experience on how to organize external sources. Based on our examination of six cities opening their data for innovation, we found that while cities often started with one or the other approach to organizing their external sources, each approach was inadequate in ways that could potentially be addressed by the addition of the other approach. Thus, we conclude with an integrated approach in which the needs of the entire ecosystem of sources and supporters of innovation are organized to address both competitive and community needs.

"Open innovation is an emergent paradigm by which organisations make use of their internal and external resources to perform their innovation processes. The growth of information and communication technologies has facilitated the spread of online open innovation communities, where users can share ideas as well as comment on and evaluate ideas posted by other community members. In this work, the behaviour of community members is analysed from the perspective of social network analysis. The final aim is twofold: first, to measure to what extent the different forms of participation are correlated to each other; and, second, how the collective intelligence evaluation schemes can be useful to identify those users posting ideas which are potentially applicable for the organisation. Obtained results can help community managers and organisations to improve the efficiency of the evaluation process when hundreds or thousands of ideas are shared through the online community.";3;Business;Ref527;Q2;2014
A focus on the consumer has been recognized as the key to unlocking new sources of competitive advantage. This paper looks at this new perspective in value creation where personalized consumer experience takes central stage as opposed to a product and firm-centric view. Through an explorative case study, the paper illustrates how a joint innovation effort between Molson Coors Brewing Company UK (MCBC-UK) and a supplier is leading to more open approaches as consumers are involved in the process. By understanding what consumers' value and engaging in active dialog and interaction, MCBC-UK has been able to develop superior value propositions relevant to their target consumer base. The case underscores the role of consumer value creation in a commoditizing world where companies can seek to maximize the lifetime value of desirable consumer segments by taking consumers as a partner or co-producer instead of an external element. Food and drink companies have the opportunity to add value and extricate themselves from commodity sectors where the lowest cost provider holds sway by embracing consumers' ideas as part of the innovation process.;1;Agriculture;Ref528;Q2;2014
"We surveyed 125 large firms in Europe and the United States with annual sales in excess of $250 million to examine the extent to which large firms are now practicing open innovation. Our results showed that open innovation is not a passing fad: 78 percent of the firms report practicing open innovation, none have abandoned it, and 82 percent of those practicing open innovation report that it is practiced more intensively today than three years ago. We also asked about specific practices for ""outside-in"" and ""inside-out"" open innovation. We found that customer co-creation, informal networking, and university grants were the three leading inbound practices in 2011; crowdsourcing and open innovation intermediary services were rated lowest in importance. Joint ventures, selling market-ready products, and standardization were the three leading outbound practices; donations to commons and spinoffs were least frequently used. We also found that large firms are more likely to receive freely revealed information than they are to provide such information.";3;Business;Ref529;Q1;2014
Despite the massive interest in open innovation, limited attention has been expressed concerning the intra-organizational challenges in implementing it. An exemplary issue is the unwillingness of employees to undertake extra-organizational knowledge transactions in the form of negative attitudes against the sourcing of external knowledge (the not-invented-here (NIH) syndrome) and against the external exploitation of knowledge assets (the not-shared-here (NSH) syndrome). Using survey data collected from 331 firms, this article empirically assesses the theoretical assertion that the NIH and NSH syndromes have negative impacts on the adoption of inbound and outbound open innovation. Furthermore, it investigates how their effects can be reduced through competence-building programs based on the training of employees. By focusing on two attitudinal antecedents to openness, the findings offer an explanation for the problems that firms face in benefiting from inflows and outflows of knowledge and possible guidance as to how managers can disengage such attitudes.

Science and policy increasingly request for sustainable development and growth. Similarly, Digital Earth undergoes a paradigm shift to an open platform that actively supports user engagement. While the public becomes able to contribute new content, we recognize a gap in user-driven validation, feedback and requirements capture, and innovative application development. Rather than defining Digital Earth applications top down, we see a need for methods and tools that will help building applications bottom up and driven by community needs. These should include a technology toolbox of geospatial and environmental enablers, which allow to access functional building blocks and content in multiple ways, but - equally important - enable the collaboration within partially unknown stakeholder networks. The validation and testing in real-life scenarios will be a central requirement when approaching the Digital Earth 2020 goals, which were articulated recently. We particularly argue to follow a Living Lab approach for co-creation and awareness rising in relation to environmental and geospatial matters. We explain why and how such a Digital Earth Living Lab could lead to a sustainable approach for developing, deploying, and using Digital Earth applications and suggest a paradigm shift for Virtual Globes becoming forums for research and innovation.;10;Geography;Ref531;Q1;2014
In recent years Open Innovation (OI) processes have been receiving growing attention from the empirical and theoretical economic literature, where a debate is taking place on the aspects of complementarity or substitutability between internal R&D and 01 spillover. By means of a differential game approach, we analyze the case of substitutability in an 01 setup in a Cournot duopoly where knowledge spillovers are endogenously determined via the R&D process. The game produces multiple steady states, allowing for an asymmetric solution where a firm may trade off the R&D investment against information absorption from the rival. The technical analysis and the numerical simulations point out that the firm which commits to a higher level of 01 absorption produces a smaller output and enjoys higher profits than its rival.

Purpose - Research investigating the role of factors affecting open innovation remains scarce. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of managerial ties in facilitating the two types of open innovation - in-bound and out-bound. Design/methodology/approach - Data are collected using the questionnaire survey method from 339 middle and top managers working in four high-tech industries in Malaysia. Findings - Results show that in most high-tech industries in Malaysia, managerial ties with universities and with government officials facilitate in-bound open innovation, while ties with managers at other firms do not significantly relate to it in any high-tech industry. Further, managerial ties are not found to relate significantly to out-bound open innovation in any high-tech industry except in the aerospace and electronics industries wherein ties with government officials relate negatively and positively to out-bound innovation, respectively. Practical implications - This study provides empirical evidence about the managerial ties practitioners should and should not forge to succeed in the open innovation paradigm. Originality/value - This study is probably the only study so far that gauges the impact of managerial ties on open innovation. The results of this study fill a major gap in the current open innovation theory besides providing insights for practitioners.;5;Computer;Ref533;Q1;2014
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a systematic approach to exploring potential partners for open innovation in order to facilitate the process of technological collaboration. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed approach utilizes patent information that is considered the most effective data to investigate innovation activities by applying morphology analysis (MA) and generative topology map (GTM) to the process to identify the configurations of technologies and visualize the collected patent information. In particular, diverse informative indices can assist researchers in deriving appropriate partners for technological cooperation. Findings - The hybrid approach that combines MA, GTM, and indices is useful to discover technological opportunity, identify necessary technologies and explore potential partners. The systematic process can overcome the limitations of existing approaches that depend on the insights and strategic decisions of top management, reflect a superficial relationship among firms and mostly fail to consider both theoretical and practical approaches to retrieve potential partners. Practical implications - The results of this paper will help practitioners, academic researchers, and policy makers link a pair of partners who can maximize the synergy of collaboration in a systematic manner. The proposed approach is illustrated to show the validity of the process with a case of light emitting diode (LED) technology. In addition, the social cost for collaboration can be reduced by applying the proposed approach in open innovation. Originality/value - This paper tackles the important issue of exploring appropriate partners by applying a systematic approach that utilizes text mining, MA and GTM because existing research mostly deals with ad-hoc processes. The proposed approach utilizes multiple methodologies of data mining and technology forecasting to derive promising technology areas in a systematic manner and then employs critical indices to explore proper partners. Thus, this approach considers both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to suggest a sophisticated tool for successful open innovation. Moreover, a real case - LED case was illustrated to demonstrate that the proposed approach can be employed to implement technological cooperation.;5;Computer;Ref534;Q1;2014
A smartphone is not only a product made up of various integrated components, but also a value-added service. As the smartphone ecosystem has evolved within the value chain of the ICT industry, smartphone manufacturers can benefit from open innovation, such as by making use of external resources and collaboration networks. However, most studies on smartphones have focused on aspects of product innovation, such as functional differentiation, usability, and market penetration rather than on innovation networks. The aim of this study is to examine how the open innovation approaches and strategic fit of smartphone manufacturers function in delivering innovation outcomes and business performance. This research examines the relationship between seven smartphone manufacturers and their collaboration partners during a recent three-year period, by analyzing four specific areas: hardware components, software, content services, and telecommunications.;8;Engineering;Ref535;Q3;2014
Taking a knowledge-based approach to innovation, we distinguish between four different innovation strategies that vary in how knowledge is sourced and exploited: open innovation (OI), closed innovation, outbound OI, and inbound OI. We build an agent-based simulation model to explore the competitive performance profiles and innovation creation potential of these different strategies. Our simulation research allows for modelling the micro-foundations of open innovation and for studying innovation strategies in different market conditions. We find that the relative financial payoffs associated with the different innovation strategies vary over time: some strategies win out in the short-term, others in the long-term. Our results also suggest that a focused closed innovation strategy can lead to higher financial performance when all the resources are concentrated on internal R&D and commercialisation. Open innovation, and in particular the inbound side of it, is a beneficial long-term strategy, whereas closed innovation may be more profitable in the short run.;8;Engineering;Ref536;Q1;2014
"This paper considers open innovation strategies in the food and drink industry and seeks to examine the determinants of openness and the impact of open behaviours by companies on innovation performance. The study clusters food and drink companies in terms of their degree of openness measured across two dimensions, namely, collaboration breadth (broad to narrow collaboration ecosystem) and collaboration depth (deeper to surface collaboration). Findings show that food and drink companies can be clustered into three open innovation modes in terms of their search strategy for external knowledge ranging from limited collaboration with traditional partners to a broad and deep openness approach with a wide spectrum of external sources. Technology pressures emerge as a key driver for greater openness. Significantly, greater openness leads to enhanced innovation performance; however, it requires a dedicated architecture for collaboration to access and leverage external knowledge.";8;Engineering;Ref537;Q1;2014
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the external sources of knowledge that better exploit internal knowledge in order to innovate. Design/methodology/approach - A balanced panel of 1,266 firms that respond to the Survey of Business Strategies for a five-year period was used, which represents a total of 6,330 observations. Findings - The influence of the absorptive capacity on new products is significant, with an inverted U-shaped relationship. The interaction between external sources of knowledge and firm's absorptive capacity has a negative effect on innovation up to a certain level (substitution effect), after which that interaction improves the innovation of firms, displaying a complementary effect. Practical implications - Firms with excess of internal sources of knowledge do not obtain better innovative results because overtime firms tend to inertia and need external sources of knowledge to obtain new knowledge. Firms must be conscious that the effect on innovation of using a strategy of external knowledge acquisition could be different depending on their internal knowledge base level. Thus, those firms that select their strategies to combine knowledge appropriately will have better results. Originality/value - This paper reveals that the positive effect of internal sources of knowledge on innovation decline after it reaches a high level because those firms with strong absorptive capacity may enter a state of organizational inertia that reduces their innovation. This research enhances the importance of identifying each of the external knowledge sources likely to be used, since their influence on innovation differs depending on the level of internal knowledge. Finally, this study is based on panel data models, which allows us to control unobservable heterogeneity improving earlier studies that had to rely on cross-sectional data.;13;Information;Ref538;Q1;2014
The concept of open innovation has successfully diffused in academia as well as in industry. However, criticisms have at the same time been raised regarding the lack of a precise definition and also similar past research has not been sufficiently recognized. This paper highlights two perspectives of openness related to innovation - open as libre' versus controlled' - arguing that they rest on different underlying assumptions and theoretical foundations related to knowledge and value production. The paper concludes that the general research on open innovation' implicitly utilizes both perspectives, which tends to give a somewhat fragmented and incoherent perception of what open innovation is and how it should be applied in practice.;3;Business;Ref539;Q1;2013
"Innovation has been identified as the single most relevant element in fuelling corporations' competitive advantage and ultimate value creation. Corporations no longer rely on a single, linear structure of innovation; the new paradigm of open innovation opens up new possibilities of organizing innovation within the ecosystem, thus giving rise to new drivers for value creation. These value drivers have an impact on the strategic position of the firm and have the ability to create superior financial performance. In this paper we explore the close relationship between open innovation and value creation and propose a framework to analyze this process as well as the most critical elements involved.";3;Business;Ref540;Q1;2013
Open innovation, fuelled by the rise of the Internet, has made it feasible and cheaper for firms to open themselves up to a wide range of external sources of innovative ideas. The explosive growth of open innovation intermediary networks, such as InnoCentive or Linked-in, enables the rapid pairing of firms seeking knowledge to address a wide range of business challenges (seekers) with other firms or individuals who already have relevant knowledge (solvers or knowledge brokers). These intermediary networks allow procurement departments to source codified and un-codified knowledge from firms or individuals outside their traditional supplier networks using one-off transactional relationships. Although sourcing ideas in this way theoretically poses problems for knowledge search and transfer, we have found that companies can draw on processes and integration mechanisms developed by procurement and design engineering to develop effective organizational learning routines. These routines are strategically vital to source new ideas through open innovation using intermediary networks and create competitive advantage.;8;Engineering;Ref541;Q1;2013
As part of the Open Government Initiative, the Barack Obama administration has called for new forms of collaboration with stakeholders to increase the innovativeness of public service delivery. Federal managers are employing a new policy instrument called Challenge.gov to implement open innovation concepts invented in the private sector to crowdsource solutions from previously untapped problem solvers and to leverage collective intelligence to tackle complex social and technical public management problems. The authors highlight the work conducted by the Office of Citizen Services and Innovative Technologies at the General Services Administration, the administrator of the Challenge.gov platform. Specifically, this Administrative Profile features the work of Tammi Marcoullier, program manager for Challenge.gov, and Karen Trebon, deputy program manager, and their role as change agents who mediate collaborative practices between policy makers and public agencies as they navigate the political and legal environments of their local agencies. The profile provides insights into the implementation process of crowdsourcing solutions for public management problems, as well as lessons learned for designing open innovation processes in the public sector.;3;Business;Ref542;Q1;2013
Few studies on open innovation (OI) address OI practices in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and how their use of OI and the resulting benefits differ from those of large enterprises. The lack of resources in SMEs to engage in looking outward is said to be a barrier to OI, but at the same time this shortage is cited as a motive for looking beyond organisational boundaries for technological knowledge. We investigate how OI dimensions impact the innovative performance of SMEs in comparison to large companies. The key finding is that the effects of OI practices in SMEs often differ from those in large firms. SMEs are more effective in using different OI practices simultaneously when they introduce new products on the market, whereas this is less the case for large firms. Turnover from new products in SMEs is driven by intellectual property protection mechanisms, while large firms in this case benefit more from their search strategies.;3;Business;Ref543;Q1;2013
Researchers have identified open innovation as two dimensions, external technology acquisition and external technology exploitation. This study explores the direct and interactive effects of these two dimensions on firm performance and further examines the moderation effects of two factors (i.e., internal R&D and environmental turbulence) on the relationship between both types of open innovation and firm performance. Based on Chesbrough's open innovation model, multi-item scales were developed to measure two dimensions of firm-level open innovation. Survey results of 176 Taiwanese high tech manufacturing firms provide support for most hypotheses. The result shows that external technology acquisition positively affects firm performance, whereas external technology exploitation does not. This study also finds that external technology acquisition strengthens the relationship between external technology exploitation and firm performance. Both external technology acquisition and external technology exploitation are positively related to firm performance under high internal R&D investment and a turbulent market environment. However, technological turbulence only positively affects the relationship between external technological acquisition, but not external technology exploitation, and firm performance. The findings contribute to enhanced understanding of how the degree of leveraging open innovation dimensions depends on their complementarity, internal R&D, and environmental turbulence.

The service innovation literature lacks empirical studies that focus on the links between service firms and universities. This paper aims to contribute to a better understanding of these links. This paper applies the Portuguese version of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS 2006) to obtain data on 967 service firms. The model uses a random intercept in an ordered probit regression to empirically assess which factors influence the collaboration of service firms with universities for innovation related activities. The regression also considers the unobserved firm heterogeneity. The results demonstrate that innovation success, radical innovations, and innovation intensity are crucial to the development of links between innovative service firms and universities.

Laursen and Salter (2006) examined the impact of a firm's search strategy for external knowledge on innovative performance. Based on organizational learning and open innovation literature, we extend the model hypothesizing that the search strategy itself is impacted by firm context. That is, both constraints on the application of firm resources' and the abundance of external knowledge' have a direct impact on innovative performance and a firm's search strategy in terms of breadth and depth. Based on a survey of Swiss-based firms, we find that constraints decrease and external knowledge increases innovative performance. Although constraints lead to a broader but shallower search, external knowledge is associated with the breadth and the depth of the search in a U-shaped relationship.

Open innovation, which refers to combining internal and external ideas and internal and external paths to market in order to achieve advances in processes or technologies, is an attractive paradigm for structuring collaborations between developed and developing country entities and people. Such open innovation collaborations can be designed to foster true co-creation among partners in rich and poor settings, thereby breaking down hierarchies and creating greater impact and value for each partner. Using an example from Concern Worldwide's Innovations for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health initiative, this commentary describes an early-stage pilot project built around open innovation in a low resource setting, which puts communities at the center of a process involving a wide range of partners and expertise, and considers how it could be adapted and make more impactful and sustainable by extending the collaboration to include developed country partners.;3;Business;Ref548;Q1;2013
"Open practices have been at the forefront of research, business and political agendas for some time. Traditionally, research has focused on analysing critical factors for the deployment of Open Source (OS) Software and has highlighted the roles of ""Collective Intelligence"" and ""participation in voluntary communities"" in facilitating OS development. Nevertheless, there is little literature examining the role these Open Innovation (01) practices may play in influencing the private-collective model of innovation and its application in economies-in-crisis to create public-good innovations. To address this gap, this paper uses the case of Greece. Data were gathered from interviews conducted with public policy makers and private sector top executives. The findings underline the importance of using OS as software to deal with cost reduction during debt crisis; but more importantly reveal a shift from OS to utilising the aforementioned 01 practices to support the creation of public-good innovations through the private-collective model of innovation, and the difficulties faced in encouraging this initiative due to insufficient national innovation policy, and different philosophies, structures, and cultures followed by the organisations. The study calls for changes in the national policy supported by the private-collective model to leverage innovation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.";3;Business;Ref549;Q1;2013
Open innovation, defined as a firm's purposive pursuit and integration of external inputs for new product development, offers an alternative perspective on innovation. Drawing on resource-based and capability theories, this study identifies key factors that enable inbound open innovation and increase its efficacy in a business-to-business context. Because open innovation relies on external connections, relational capability-that is, the firm's ability to make and manage relationships with other firms-should enhance the effects of inbound open innovation on firm performance. Two key resources may further enhance the moderating effects of relational capability: network spillovers that indicate knowledge-rich surroundings, and flexibility that allows for responsiveness and adaptability. The authors test these relationships with data from managers in 204 business-to-business high-tech firms, as well as secondary data pertaining to firm performance and flexibility. The results support the expectations that the ability to build interfirm relationships in a-knowledge-rich environment increase the efficacy of inbound open innovation for gaining superior financial performance. Interestingly, additional analyses suggest an unexpected nonlinear interaction effect with flexibility. When firms possess strong relational capabilities and adopt an open innovation approach, they achieve higher financial performance if they have a low or a high level of flexibility. The theoretical and managerial implications of these findings are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;3;Business;Ref550;Q1;2013
Today, innovation is no longer viewed as taking place within a single firm - but opening up the innovation process is still not a simple task. In open innovation, the mechanisms of incorporating external resources into the development process need to be carefully managed. This paper suggests a dual technology roadmap (TRM) that considers both internal and external firms. First, we introduce the concept of a dual TRM that considers partner resources as well as internal resources. Second, we suggest the structure of a dual TRM that uses dual planning objects. Third, three types of dual TRM are suggested, with three case examples. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;3;Business;Ref551;Q1;2013
Open innovation efforts traditionally focus on sourcing external solutions against known needs. This approach, while helping the organization to close gaps in internal capabilities, has only limited impact on ideation and strategy. A broader awareness of technology and market trends can itself become a powerful source of new and differentiating ideas. Because of this, a systematic process for building technology awareness and articulating and disseminating knowledge within the organization is critical for enabling a collaborative cross-functional ideation process. This can be accomplished through systematic, proactive scouting and technology landscape maps, which, for a given technology domain, identify technology drivers, critical technology attributes, related existing and emerging technologies with their commercial readiness levels, and the opportunity space enabled by these technologies. We are sharing a new framework, with associated processes and tools that we developed at Kennametal. This process addresses a broader set of objectives than targeted technology searches and is versatile enough to be applied to any technology domain.;3;Business;Ref552;Q1;2013
Open innovation represents an emergent paradigm by which organizations make use of internal and external resources to drive their innovation processes. The growth of information and communication technologies has facilitated a direct contact with customers and users, which can be organized as open innovation communities through Internet. The main drawback of this scheme is the huge amount of information generated by users, which can negatively affect the correct identification of potentially applicable ideas. This paper proposes the use of evolutionary computation techniques for the identification of innovators, that is, those users with the ability of generating attractive and applicable ideas for the organization. For this purpose, several characteristics related to the participation activity of users though open innovation communities have been collected and combined in the form of discriminant functions to maximize their correct classification. The right classification of innovators can be used to improve the ideas evaluation process carried out by the organization innovation team. Besides, obtained results can also be used to test lead user theory and to measure to what extent lead users are aligned with the organization strategic innovation policies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

R&D and innovation increasingly take place in networks that extend beyond the boundaries of a single firm, with customers in an important role in the learning processes involved. This phenomenon is captured by the term open innovation. Advantages of open innovation encompass cost reduction and an increased competitiveness. Spatial innovation theory however indicates that the potential of open innovation is not the same for all urban regions, there may be differences between large metropolitan areas and small cities. In this context, the authors compare university spin-off firms in two contrasting urban regions in Europe, Delft in the Netherlands and Trondheim in Norway (a metropolitan area versus an isolated city) with regard to the profile of their learning networks and the contribution of these networks to growth. Learning networks appear to differ in structure and strength, in spatial configuration and also in the influence on job growth. Thus, networks in Delft (in a large metropolitan area) tend to be stronger compared to those in Trondheim (isolated city), whereas the influence of network strength on growth tends to be negative in Delft but positive in Trondheim. Overall, firms in Trondheim tend to rely more on own resources and capabilities and less on learning networks in open innovation.;9;Environmental;Ref554;Q1;2013
The purpose of this paper is to examine the behaviour of small independent financial advisors (IFAs) in terms of their involvement in networks and open innovation. A mail survey of small IFAs was undertaken utilising previously validated scales to assess business performance in relation to networking and open innovation. Results indicate that IFAs involvement in networks and open innovation can assist business performance. The managerial implications are that IFAs and other financial services organisation sector firms may be able to achieve higher sales growth by participating in networks and engaging in open innovation. This paper provides an original empirical assessment of possible strategies to enhance sales growth in small financial service sector firms facing volatile market conditions.;3;Business;Ref555;Q2;2013
"Our introduction provides the foundation and background for this special issue on open innovation. Since the beginning of the 21st century, innovation has evolved from being the artefact of an individual or internal process within firms to an interactive process between firms and/or in collaboration with knowledge-creating institutions at both the domestic and global levels. The open innovation model suggests that firms should combine external and internal ideas and technologies as effective pathways to market when advancing and commercialising technologies. However, existing research focuses mainly on high-technology multi-national firms hence, theoretically driven and empirically-based research exploring open innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises remains relatively scarce. This special issue offers a critical contribution to this gap with four articles which explore differing aspects of open innovation within smaller firms. The introduction to this special issue commences with an overview of the relevant literature; it then describes the articles and, finally, suggests potential avenues for future research.";3;Business;Ref556;Q1;2013
This study assesses the adoption of open innovation practices during different value chain activities and measures its effect on product and process innovation. Based on a quantitative survey of 293 US small and medium-sized manufacturing companies the empirical research results suggest a broad use of open innovation practices with customers and suppliers throughout the firm's value chain. Strong interrelationships between open innovation practices along with the varied impact of open innovation practices on product and process innovation performance are presented and discussed. Overall, the study expands the understanding of open innovation beyond its traditional research and development focus, and highlights the importance of a stronger focus on selection of practices and partners for the effectiveness of open innovation.;3;Business;Ref557;Q1;2013
"Public funding of university and company-based R&D centres of excellence is widespread both in core and more peripheral regions. What is less well-known is whether these R&D centres can catalyse multi-directional, multi-actor and iterative innovation. Based on data from a real-time monitoring study, this article explores the development of 18 R&D centres' external connections. University-based R&D centres establish more new connections than company-based centres and are more likely to be interacting with small or micro-firms. However, there is a general bias towards links with larger firms; micro, small and medium-sized enterprises also are less likely to be involved in collaborative R&D with research centres than other types of relationships. The results suggest the potential for R&D centres to act as a catalyst for open innovation but emphasise the need to ensure that the focus of the R&D being conducted is relevant to the needs of smaller firms.";3;Business;Ref558;Q1;2013
This article explores the role of social capital in enabling knowledge transfer and exchange (KTE) between higher education institutions (HEIs) and spin-off (academic and non-academic) small and medium-sized enterprises in the context of open innovation, in order to convert knowledge into innovation within regional innovation systems. It presents the findings from 18 in-depth interviews with related stakeholders, and social network analysis of relationships in an exemplar technology park in Andalucia, southern Spain. The main findings suggest that there are many challenges to achieving successful KTE in regional innovation systems: recognition, intellectual property contracts and timescales. Similarly, there are opportunities related to intermediaries, joint teams and market impact. Significantly, the study highlights the importance of both formal and informal relationships as enablers of successful KTE involving HEIs and spin-off small and medium-sized enterprises in the context of open innovation.;3;Business;Ref559;Q1;2013
Recently, there has been increasing interest in the principle of open innovation and its relevance to our understanding of innovation in modern industry. This article relates these ideas to the specific, yet important, case of innovation in high-technology small firms (HTSFs). HTSFs are of interest since they have produced a significant number of the most important innovations in the high-technology sectors over the past 30 years. Certainly as far as HTSFs are concerned, it is argued that the ideas behind greater openness during innovation are not well suited to the way in which this type of firm innovates. Moreover, it is argued more generally that the work of Chesbrough can be criticised for overstating the potential for greater openness in terms of industrial research and development, since a degree of openness has always existed, while simultaneously understating the merits of closed innovation systems.;3;Business;Ref560;Q1;2013
Current approaches to open innovation can be characterized in two general categories: open-boundary innovation and open-source innovation. Open-boundary innovation is designed to source new technology and concepts broadly without surrendering control of the innovation process, while open-source innovation is a more radical model that challenges fundamental assumptions about the nature of the corporation. The appropriate corporate response to open-source innovation is difficult to define, as the risks are unknown. However, as open-source movements gather steam, corporate innovators will need to consider whether and how to approach open-source innovation.;3;Business;Ref561;Q1;2013
"This article examines the relative value of open innovation principles for digital media, exemplified by the emergence of Open Application Programming Interfaces (Open APIs) at four news organizations: The New York Times, The Guardian, USA Today and NPR. The use of Open APIs represents a shift toward an open innovation paradigm that may help address twin challenges facing the news industry: the need for improved R&D and the need for new revenue streams. This paper extends the interdisciplinary study of open innovation to digital communication. Findings indicate that the use of Open APIs has accelerated R&D through knowledge-sharing with web developers; generated new means of commercializing content by extending a firm's product portfolio; and forged innovation networks that function as external R&D departments. The article discusses the constant negotiation between openness and control, and open and closed paradigms in journalism.";4;Communication;Ref562;Q1;2013
Recently, a large number of new innovative enterprises engaged in different competitive markets by promoting innovation both in products and in services through open innovation web-based platforms, which allow for the collaboration of individual users and companies and for so-called crowdsourcing. A key issue concerns the identification of the most important motivations that could attract users with a specific role to proactively participate and contribute to the open and collaborative innovation processes. This article, after highlighting the theoretical background, grounded on large body of psychology and sociology literature on the motivation behind collaboration, discusses the results of the analysis of 26 open innovation web-based platforms based on a multiple research methodology (qualitative empirical study, factor analysis and multi-dimensional scaling). It also discusses the effects of motivational systems' and platform models on the attraction of the individuals characterised by different innovation roles.;8;Engineering;Ref563;Q1;2013
The organizational literature is increasingly interested in the origins and consequences of category emergence. We examine the effects of being affiliated with categories initially considered illegitimate (divergence'), and of organizational attempts to blur the boundaries between categories (straddling'), on capital market reactions to firm announcements. We develop arguments for how these effects likely vary with increasing legitimation (currency') of the category. We apply event study methodology to the complete population of firms' announcements of open source activities, an open innovation model for software development that is novel and defies the extant dominant logic of software production and valorization. Over a ten-year period, we find negative effects of divergence, positive effects of straddling, and that the magnitude of both these effects diminishes with increasing category currency. The implications for theories of organization and open innovation in the context of category emergence are discussed.;3;Business;Ref564;Q1;2013
"This article examines an experiment in open innovation applied to scientific research on Type 1 diabetes at Harvard Medical School. In the traditional research process, a single research team typically carries through each stage of the process-from generating the idea to raising money to carrying out the research and publishing the results. Harvard Catalyst, a pan-Harvard agency with a mission to speed biomedical research from the lab to patients' bedsides, modified the traditional grant proposal process as an experiment in bringing greater openness into every stage of research. Participation was successfully extended to nontraditional actors. In the end, 150 new hypotheses and research pathways were proposed. Teams were invited to propose projects on the 12 most promising of these; today, seven teams are carrying out the research. The Harvard Catalyst experience suggests that open-innovation principles can be adopted even within a well-established and experienced innovation-driven organization.";3;Business;Ref565;Q1;2013
Is it necessary or even possible to apply the management technology of open innovation to all projects in the same way? An analysis of the practices used in different product development projects in the same European medical company shows that commercially successful projects did apply many of the best practices for open innovation. However, projects were not equally successful. The outcome seems to be highly influenced by the type of collaborative arrangements used and their application. In particular, the analysis indicates that organizational factors seem to be indicative but not sufficient for success, and some open innovation practices were more successful than others. The most open and exploratory practices were not so successful in this company. This might be due to the nature of innovation, which develops in unpredictable and nonlinear ways. These observations suggest that those involved in open innovation need both a broad knowledge of the various potential elements of an open innovation effort and a flexible attitude toward their application.;3;Business;Ref566;Q1;2013
"Open innovation, taken from the fields of business strategy and technology development, can offer planners fresh insights into their own practice. Open innovation, like citizen participation, goes outside the boundaries of the organization to find solutions to problems and to hand ideas off to partners. A key technique for open innovation is ""crowdsourcing,"" issuing a challenge to a large and diverse group in hopes of arriving at new solutions more robust than those found inside the organization. The differences between citizen participation and Internet-based crowdsourcing are discussed. Crowdsourcing case studies are provided as a means for extending an emerging literature.";3;Business;Ref567;Q1;2013
The paper reports an action study of seven innovation projects with collaborative partnerships in inter-organisational networks that are facilitated by innovation intermediaries. It contributes to open innovation literature the understanding of innovation processes as nested processes of co-creation on the one side and economic exchange on the other side. While innovation project management and (online) market places are well researched as distinct strategic positions, our observations suggest a third strategic position for innovation intermediaries as process coordinators with strategic innovation capabilities. The paper identifies matchmaking and innovation process design, management of collaborative projects, project valuation and portfolio management as three such strategic capabilities and identifies directions for future research on this emerging phenomenon.;3;Business;Ref568;Q2;2013
Purpose - The authors aim to investigate the concept of open innovation, identify different open innovation practices which help describe the continuum between closed and open innovation, and propose a framework that suggests an association between innovation contexts and practices. Design/methodology/approach - The authors first identify the variables to describe innovation contexts and practices. Such variables are developed based on the literature and on a previous paper by the same authors in 2011. Then, they establish an association between contexts and practices, and test it through cases drawn from the existing literature. Findings - The paper proposes a detailed assessment of open innovation practices and suggests the association between each of them and diverse innovation contexts. A few case examples drawn from the literature prove coherent with the theoretical framework underlying the proposed association. Practical implications - The authors' results (and specifically the framework) enhance the organizations' awareness of the open innovation concept and the possible practices to implement it, as well as supporting managers to better select open innovation practices in different contexts. Originality/value - This paper discusses the concept of open innovation practices to enhance the comprehension of the open innovation concept. Also, to the authors' knowledge, the proposed association between context and practices is original in that there are no similar theoretical frameworks that help organizations selecting innovation practices.;13;Information;Ref569;Q1;2013
Purpose - Little research focuses on the conditions under which companies open up to co-develop knowledge with external actors. Spatial proximity has been proved insufficient to generate successful open innovation processes: socio-economic proximity also seems required. This paper aims at better understanding how this new form of proximity can be organized and investigates the role of third parties or tertius iungens in this process. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on an exploratory case of successful open innovation between a software editor and a systems integrator located in the same cluster, relying on 50 face-to-face in-depth interviews, documentation and analysis of physical artifacts. Findings - It confirms that socio-economic and in particular coordination proximity favors open innovation processes. This proximity is facilitated by a third party acting as a sustained iungens to initiate contact between development partners and key customers, and to practically organize knowledge transfer. The paper suggests that to be effective this tertius iungens needs to occupy a central position in the local network and to exhibit the characteristics of an epistemic community. Research limitations/implications - Due to its exploratory design, the authors' research exhibits several limitations in terms of generalization. It does not fully appreciate the specific interaction between the various dimensions of proximity and in what respect spatial proximity positively influences or reinforces the development of socioeconomic proximity. Further research is needed to analyze the relationships between these various forms of proximity and understand whether spatial proximity is required in a context where new information technologies ease up relationship and coordination mechanisms. Another limitation is linked to the character of the open innovation project analyzed which focused on an innovation of exploitation. Practical implications - This paper suggests that territorial engineering should favor the emergence of organizations playing the role of tertius iungens in the local network. Such organizations need to have the technical expertise and image of benevolence and integrity to manage knowledge transfer. Originality/value - Little research analyzes the role of third parties or tertius iungens in the emergence and management of open innovation processes. The literature on clusters has mostly highlighted that inter-organizational cooperation emerges from spatial proximity and can be organized by public authorities whereas most of the open innovation literature on software describes cooperation patterns that do not require any third party.;3;Business;Ref570;Q1;2013
This paper looks at firm-level differences in R&D. intensity and sales from product innovations. R&D intensity and innovative sales are explained by a model using harmonised firm-level data from the Third Community Innovation Survey for three European countries: Belgium, Germany and Spain. For each country, the average estimates suggest that incoming knowledge spillovers, research cooperation, appropriability and human capital all exercise a positive influence on R&D intensity and, through this, on innovative sales. Quantile regressions indicate that, although there are differences between countries, the joint relative impact of incoming knowledge spillovers and research cooperation tends to increase quantile-wise in relation to that of appropriability. This suggests that strong innovators have a more open innovation process.;8;Engineering;Ref571;Q1;2013
Theory and practice both have recognised the importance of external knowledge to enhance organisations' innovation performance. Due to organisations' growing interest in effectively collaborating with external knowledge sources, research has investigated the importance of firm-external stakeholder interaction in open innovation. Despite valuable insights into the importance of the variety of external knowledge sources to enhance (open) innovation, research has overlooked so far that managers' characteristics and practices are relevant for the absorption of external knowledge in open innovation. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore how organisations' absorptive capacity exploration, transformation, and exploitation - becomes manifested in managers' characteristics and practices in open innovation. This article reports on the findings obtained from four case studies of manufacturing and service organisations. Our findings show that the exploration, transformation, and exploitation of external knowledge are associated with a distinct set of managers' characteristics and practices that capture the dominant pattern of processing external knowledge in open innovation.;8;Engineering;Ref572;Q1;2013
As the argument regarding the effect of firm size on the effectiveness of innovation continues, the particularities of open innovation from the perspective of emerging market small and medium enterprises (EM SMEs) must be addressed. We propose a network framework by bridging the resource-based view and the social network perspective with their respective emphases on the importance of EM SME innovation capacity. Specifically, we address this gap by exploring the incidence of and trends toward open innovation, using a survey data of 420 innovative SMEs of China. Our study supports open innovation from the social network perspective and shows the open innovation of considering important choices for SMEs in the emerging market setting. Our analyses of Chinese SMEs data largely support our theoretical framework and demonstrate the importance of factors across firm characteristics (innovation capacity and innovation barriers), network openness, and network information in understanding open innovation in EM SMEs.;8;Engineering;Ref573;Q1;2013
Purpose - This study aims to examine the roles of dynamic innovation capabilities and open innovation activities in breakthrough innovation. Drawing from the absorptive capacity perspective, organizational inertia theory, and open innovation, the authors seek to argue that dynamic innovation capabilities have a curvilinear effect on breakthrough innovation that is moderated by open innovation activities. Design/methodology/approach - A mail survey was sent to the top 1,000 firms in Taiwan, the target respondents being senior managers with experience in developing at least three successful breakthrough innovations in the past five years. A total of 218 usable questionnaires were collected, resulting in a respondent rate of 22.9 percent. Findings - The findings support the argument that dynamic innovation capabilities have an inverted U-shape relationship with breakthrough innovation. Meanwhile, open innovation activities strengthen the positive effects of dynamic innovation capabilities on breakthrough innovation. Research limitations/implications - The findings enrich the existing literature by proposing and confirming empirically that open innovation activities help firms with effective coordination of dynamic innovation capabilities. Practical implications - Managers must be aware of the limitations of their existing dynamic innovation capabilities in terms of developing breakthrough innovation. Originality/value - This study not only resolves the conflicting views about the relationship between dynamic capabilities and innovation but also adds to the existing literature that indicates the failure of leading firms in the face of rapid environmental change.;3;Business;Ref574;Q1;2013
"Purpose - This study aims to examine how open innovation can be effective in changing organizational inertia to create business model innovation and improve firm performance. It also seeks to explore whether the existence of open innovation has a mediating effect and influence. Design/methodology/approach - This study constructs a theoretical model to explore the relationship between latent variables and uses a questionnaire to collect research data. In the conceptual framework, organizational inertia is a second-order latent variable and comprises three first-order latent variables: insight inertia, action inertia, and psychological inertia. Open innovation is also a second-order latent variable, and consists of two first-order latent variables: outbound and inbound open innovation. To clarify the relationship between these latent variables, structural equation modeling (SEM) is used to test the goodness of fit of the theoretical model and research hypotheses. This study uses 141 small to medium-sized manufacturing enterprises (SMEs) in Taiwan as the research subjects. Findings - The SEM analysis revealed that open innovation has a significant mediating effect on the relationship between organizational inertia and business model innovation, and the relationship between organizational inertia and firm performance; business model innovation also has a positive influence on firm performance. Originality/value - This study contributes the empirical analysis of SMEs to illustrate the role of open innovation on business model innovation processes.";3;Business;Ref575;Q2;2013
In order to achieve a high level of innovativeness, cities are in collaboration with public and private organisations that allow city halls to tap into networks of companies and clusters as well as execute projects. This article focuses on this kind of public or private firm, public open innovation (POI) intermediaries, which operate in the public sector. An exploratory multi-case study was conducted with the participation of POI intermediaries and local governments in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. The eight cases reveal that certain public or private companies act as a bridge - POI intermediary - across the large cognitive distances between city halls and a network of organisations, while orchestrating the collaboration of actors and executing innovation projects. These findings motivate policy makers to enhance the innovativeness and competitiveness of cities, and they offer useful guidelines for city halls to improve their innovation process and remove possible obstacles.;3;Business;Ref576;Q2;2013
Universities and Public Research Organisation rely on the capabilities and competences of their transfer offices to engage with commercial partners and to manage the exchange of knowledge and expertise. This paper promotes a model that can be used to analyse the capabilities and relative strategies of these transfer offices. Based on a 'core competences' approach the model enables the precise characterisation of the different modes and methods of transfer and engagement. Findings, coming from a two-year, in-depth comparative study of two transfer offices located in France and in the UK, underline the office's relative positioning within their institutional environment and identify the relative priority given to their use of the channels of transfer. These results provide a guide for the strategic management of transfer offices that are now operating within an 'open innovation' paradigm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"The empirical studies in the area of Open Innovation (OI) reveal that there is a significant bias in favour of countries on the technological frontier. The present study aims to bridge this gap by examining firms in Portugal, a country at an intermediate stage of technological development. Based on 70 innovative firms, we found that whatever perspective of the OI model is considered, firms tend, on average, to share a relatively closed innovation model when compared with firms located in countries where technological development is advanced. About a quarter of the surveyed firms implemented the OI model in their innovation strategy/business, this being much more widely disseminated regarding the absorption of external knowledge/technology, with almost 40% of firms surveyed acknowledging its use in comparison with the perspective of transfer of knowledge/technology to other organisations - less than 10% provide their ""surplus technology"" to other organisations. This result may indicate a lack of awareness of the economic potential of making internally created technologies available to third parties, albeit this potential might also depend on other circumstances such as technology architecture (the system and interdependence of technologies).";3;Business;Ref578;Q2;2012
Given that open innovation web-based platforms (OIPs) allow for the collaboration of individuals and companies, this paper focuses on exploring the motivations for participating and collaborating in OIPs. Extant studies are conflicting, especially with respect to the importance of the monetary reward as a motivation. Moreover, literature supports our premise from the individuals' motivations analysis viewpoint, but not from the companies' perspective. Finally, literature does not consider the differences related to different members and to different phases of the innovation process. First, we base the literature on open innovation on the Internet (crowdsourcing, peer production and open source) to identify the potential motivations. We then deeply analyse 116 OIPs to determine if the motivations can be a function of the phase of innovation and the dependency on members. We show that the design of the motivational system should take into consideration the different stages of the innovation process and that the OIPs should consider moving from 'work place' logic to 'social place' logic.;3;Business;Ref579;Q1;2012
Cooperation with other organizations increases the innovation performance of organization, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they encounter liabilities of smallness (e.g., limited financial resources, and manpower). In the medical devices sector, collaboration with external partners for NPD becomes increasingly important due to the complexity of the products and the development process. About 80% of companies in this sector are SMEs. These companies operate in a highly regulated sector, which affects the organization of the external network required for the new product development (NPD) process. SMEs are practicing extensively open innovation activities, but in practice face a number of barriers in trying to apply open innovation. This paper examines multiple network characteristics simultaneously in relation to innovation performance and thereby aligns with and builds further on configuration theory. Configuration theory posits that for each set of network characteristics, there exists an ideal set of organizational characteristics that yields superior performance. In this research, the systems approach to fit is used. Fit is high to the extent that an organization is similar to an ideal profile along multiple dimensions. This ideal profile represents the network profile that the 15% highest performing companies use. It is argued that the smaller the distance between the ideal profile and the network profile that is used, the higher the performance. The objective of this research is (1) to examine the relation between the ideal profile and innovation performance and (2) to examine which organization of the network profile is related to high innovation performance. Quantitative survey data (n?=?60, response rate 61.9%) form the core of this research. The quantitative results are clarified and have been triangulated with qualitative interview data (n?=?50). Our findings suggest the presence of an ideal NPD network profile (in terms of goal complementarity, resource complementarity, fairness trust, reliability trust, and network position strength): the more a company's NPD network profile differs from this ideal profile, the lower the innovation performance. In addition, the results of our study indicate that the NPD network profiles of successful and less successful SMEs in the medical devices sector significantly differ in terms of goal complementarity, while this is less the case for trust and resource complementarity labeled distinctive by previous research. Finally, results show that a relatively closed, focused, and consistent business-like NPD networking approach, which is characterized by result orientation and professionalism, is related to high innovation performance. It is recommended that SMEs in the medical devices sector aiming to distinguish themselves from competitors in terms of innovation performance focus on goal complementarity while adopting such a business-like attitude toward their NPD network partners.;3;Business;Ref580;Q1;2012
The open innovation model embraces the purposive flow of internal and external ideas as a foundation for innovation and network formation. While the open innovation paradigm has been successfully applied in high-tech settings, there is a lack of research on adopters of open innovation in other settings. We describe a case study conducted in a process industry setting, focusing on the LKAB mineral group as it makes a transition from a closed to a more open innovation context by adopting remote diagnostics technology. This process has resulted in the creation of new value networks. By tracing the reasoning behind the organizational transformation and studying the technology used to carry it through, we seek to explore the preconditions for open innovation and provide insight into the role of IT in the process. Our findings show that adoption of the open innovation model is grounded in developing organizational environments that are conducive to innovation, including expertise in creating a culture for knowledge sharing, building a trustful environment, and a resourceful use of IT.

Although there is increasing interest in exploring open innovation in developing countries, the conceptual and potential applications of using open innovation in the small to medium enterprise sector are rarely explored. Since SMEs often have a dominant impact on national economies, their innovative potential should not be neglected. While SMEs in developed countries have learned how to innovate, SMEs in developing countries face a range of obstacles that hinder them from innovating as much as they could This paper suggests that in these cases a government agency using innovation hubs, could help SMEs to connect, communicate and collaborate with independent inventors and other parties to jumpstart innovation practices. A joint innovation model is presented to address known issues and a number of cases from developing countries are summarized to test the model.;3;Business;Ref582;Q1;2012
Transaction cost economics (TCE) has had a strong impact on theories of economic exchange but also on open innovation, even though the relationship is often implicit rather than explicit. In this paper, we highlight what we consider to be the problematic use of TCE in the context of open innovation, suggesting that it has a limited descriptive power and potentially does normative damage to open innovation practice. A case study of the Volvo Group will be drawn upon to illustrate these claims. The case questions the belief that hierarchical control eliminates transaction costs. Also, it suggests that an overemphasis on calculative reduction of transaction costs together with a focus on governance and rationality leave little space for an innovative climate, thus diverting attention away from the creative potential of transactions. Indeed the self-fulfilling prophecy character of subscribing to the assumptions of TCE may not merely limit but actually undermine innovation.;3;Business;Ref583;Q1;2012
Virtual customer integration and open innovation are considered as appropriate means to improve the success of new product development. However, only when consumers are qualified and motivated to contribute promising ideas and relevant know-how they are able to add value to a producer's innovation process. In this study, we explore the symmetric and asymmetric impact of various creativity components on consumers' idea generation, concept development, or prototype building abilities as well as interest in co-creation projects. Our results show that creativity components are of different importance. While some characteristics are needed above certain thresholds to successfully accomplish a certain development task, exceeding those does not necessarily lead to better outputs. Other characteristics improve the creative output only if they exceed specific levels.;3;Business;Ref584;Q1;2012
This study analyses the effects of four types of collaborative activities on the R&D performance of service SMEs in the context of open innovation: in-house R&D (non-collaboration), technology acquisition, R&D collaboration, and networking. For this, the study employs data envelopment analysis, a power tool that uses multiple inputs and outputs to measure the relative efficiency of collaborative activities of service SMEs for R&D. The results indicate that technology acquisition is the most efficient type of collaboration for R&D of service SMEs. More specifically in-house R&D, technology acquisition, and R&D collaboration are positively related to product/service innovation, patenting activity, and process innovation, respectively. However, networking is not significantly related to any three types of R&D performance. In addition, the service SMEs' strategic focus did not match their strategic purposes, suggesting a need for adjusting their collaborative activities. The results have important implications for managers and policy-makers interested in facilitating open innovation in service SMEs through various collaborative activities.;3;Business;Ref585;Q1;2012
Economic geography increasingly conceptualises innovation as a collective action. However, the literature on clusters often reduces the collective dimension to the circulation of knowledge between local and regional organisations based on various forms of (market, organisational, social, institutional or cognitive) co-ordination. This paper diverges from this grass-roots perspective by discussing the role of collective actions in clusters-i.e. actions developed by a large number of cluster members acting as a group. Empirical evidence drawing on a study of three digital clusters in the Paris region shows that the cluster as a collective entity holds agency and-thanks to reflexive co-ordination-can contribute to open innovation, including innovation-seeking partnerships in the early stages of cluster life cycles.;9;Environmental;Ref586;Q1;2012
Despite recent efforts, existing urban energy systems still hardly meet the demands of sustainable development or climate change. Meeting these targets thus will require innovations that use energy much more efficiently and emit far less greenhouse gases. These innovations need to be made on the production as well as the consumption side, on all levels, and need to cover not only technical aspects, but even more service solutions. While many of these solutions still need to be developed, some are already invented but only exist in limited market segments. Opening closed urban planning processes and using open innovation tools can foster bottom-up urban energy system transformation by addressing the interactive ways of decision-making integrating company representatives and citizens. While open innovation tools like (open) innovation workshops or ideas competitions are already used by several companies to find and develop new designs and products, there is yet little experience with energy efficiency ideas and bottom-up changes. Therefore, we analyse energy-efficient ideas generated in three different ideas competitions. We discuss the findings for theory and research on open innovation approaches and bottom-up urban changes. Our results show that there are a vast number of ideas available in the public. Open innovation tools offer advanced possibilities to generate energy-efficient solutions.;18;Computer;Ref587;Q2;2012
Implementing open innovation approaches in a corporation that traditionally has relied on a closed innovation model will always be challenging. This paper describes our attempt to create an open innovation capability at Roche in both the pharmaceuticals and diagnostics divisions. In the journey, we have concluded that the navigation of two important hurdles drives any large company's ability to embrace open innovation: creating the eureka moment that so vividly illustrates the value of open innovation activities that senior management no longer questions the need for them and shifting the company mindset to an open innovation culture.;3;Business;Ref588;Q1;2012
"Forget Linux, Netfiix, DARPA, and the X Prizes. Deliberate, managed open innovation goes back 300 years. At that time the determination of longitude at sea was both vitally important and apparently impossible; so having failed with a team of experts, Parliament sought solutions from a wider field via the Longitude Act of 1714, which offered a prize of 20,000 pound for a method of determining longitude to within 30 miles, to be proven on a voyage from Britain to the West Indies. The Act established a Board of Longitude to manage submissions, decide upon the prize, and, if necessary, grant additional money to support an inventor's progress. The process created for the administration of the Longitude prize remains as relevant today as any modern prize-based example.";3;Business;Ref589;Q1;2012
Our contribution lies in explaining why inter-firm variations in the strategic decision to actively seek and acquire external scientific knowledge impact not only financial performance but also the effects of firms' own R&D. We further demonstrate that the performance implications of using external knowledge and technologies vary considerably depending on their source (domestic or foreign). Knowledge sourcing from domestic organizations has negligible consequences for financial performance and an adverse effect on firms' own R&D. By contrast, knowledge acquisition from foreign countries results in superior performance and assists firms in unlocking their innovation potential. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

"The term ""open innovation"" was introduced in my 2003 book, which outlined a new model for industrial innovation. Since that time, the concept has been adopted by hundreds of academic articles and been incorporated into the innovation practices of a similarly large number of companies. At the editors' invitation, this article reviews this recent history and offers a perspective on where open innovation is going in the future.";3;Business;Ref591;Q1;2012
Today, integration of the public in research and development in health care is seen as essential for the advancement of innovation. This is a paradigmatic shift away from the traditional assumption that solely health care professionals are able to devise, develop, and disseminate novel concepts and solutions in health care. The present study builds on research in the field of open innovation to investigate the adoption of an open health platform by patients, care givers, physicians, family members, and the interested public. Results suggest that open innovation practices in health care lead to interesting innovation outcomes and are well accepted by participants. During the first three months, 803 participants of the open health platform submitted challenges and solutions and intensively communicated by exchanging 1454 personal messages and 366 comments. Analysis of communication content shows that empathic support and exchange of information are important elements of communication on the platform. The study presents first evidence for the suitability of open innovation practices to integrate the general public in health care research in order to foster both innovation outcomes and empathic support.

"OVERVIEW: An innovation capitalist can help companies manage the organizational and managerial challenges inherent in sourcing innovation externally. Innovation capitalists are innovation intermediaries; they mediate large firms' interactions with external sources of innovation. In particular, innovation capitalists seek out promising new ideas from independent inventors and other sources, invest in those ideas to transform them into market-ready concepts, and sell (or license) the related intellectual property to large client firms. Drawing on a case study of an innovation capitalist firm that focuses on sourcing ideas and technologies from universities and national labs and placing them in large global technology companies, the article suggests organizational strategies and practices that can enhance the success of open innovation initiatives involving innovation intermediaries.";3;Business;Ref593;Q1;2012
The purpose of this paper is to examine the performance of second tier UK universities in relation to the effectiveness of their knowledge management systems and involvement in open innovation. Data were acquired using a mail survey of academic staff in social science and business faculties in second tier institutions. The results indicate that certain key factors influence the effectiveness of knowledge management systems. Universities engaged in open innovation appear to have developed more effective systems. It is concluded that universities seeking to survive in the face of government spending cuts could benefit from optimising the effectiveness of their knowledge management systems and giving greater emphasis to the acquisition of new knowledge by exploiting open innovation.;7;Education;Ref594;Q3;2012
This study proposes a way of mapping open innovation research structure by quantitatively analyzing open innovation research papers retrieved from Web of Science database. A total of 130 papers are retrieved in this study and 62 papers which contain keywords are chosen for research structure visualization. Open innovation research networks are quantitatively investigated by combining network theory and keyword co-occurrence. Contour maps of open innovation are also created on the basis of networks for visualization. The networks and contour maps can be expressed differently by choosing different information as the main actors, such as the paper author, the institute, the country or the author-keywords, to reflect open innovation research structures in micro, meso, and macro-levels, respectively. The quantitative ways of exploring open innovation research structure are investigated to unveil important or emerging open innovation components as well as to demonstrate visualization of the structure of global open innovation research. The quantitative method provided in this project shows a possible way of visualizing and evaluating research community structure and thus a computerized calculation is possible for potential quantitative applications on open innovation research management, e.g. R&D resource allocation, research performance evaluation, and science map.

Prior studies suggest that open innovation activities positively influence innovation outcomes in large firms. However, few studies have investigated the implications of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) adoption of open innovation. We address this research gap by investigating the effects of four inbound open innovation activities on innovation performance of SMEs. In doing so, we draw on data from 252 high-tech SMEs. Our results reveal that different open innovation activities are beneficial for different innovation outcomes. For instance, technology sourcing is linked to radical innovation performance, whereas technology scouting is linked to incremental innovation performance. These findings hold several important theoretical and practical implications.;3;Business;Ref596;Q1;2012
"This paper investigates the impact of open innovation on national systems of innovation. The open innovation concept has become widely established among scholars and practitioners. However, an overview of its impact on national innovation systems is still lacking. Given that the innovating firm is at the core of national innovation systems, a better understanding of shifting innovation strategies at the firm level is of fundamental importance to the actions of policy-makers within the national innovation systems framework. Based on the main analytical approaches of national innovation systems and the current state of open innovation research, we argue that open innovation practices have at least three critical effects on national systems of innovation: (a) they reinforce its importance; (b) they improve its effectiveness: and (c) they diversify its networks.

"In this study, we investigate the economic and strategic value of open innovation alliances (OIAs), in which collaborators and competitors integrate in the pursuit of the codevelopment of technological innovations. Given that OIAs differ substantially from traditional, closed alliances in many aspects, including their strategic scope and scale, governing mechanisms, and member composition, it is important to understand and assess the potential value inherent in these new modes of collaboration. Furthermore, OIAs evolve over time as the participating members are free to enter and leave at will. Therefore, we also examine the on-going value creation and wealth spillover that result from changes in membership. Moreover, we investigate how a firm's participation in an IT-based open alliance alters the market value of its rivals operating within the same marketplace. To gain additional insight into the factors that moderate the market valuation of OIA participation, several contextual factors, including the degree of partner heterogeneity, innovation type, and degree of openness of the OIAs are used to account for variability in abnormal returns. Based on 194 observations, we found that allying firms realize significant positive abnormal returns when their entry into an OIA is made public. The results also suggest that substantial excessive returns accrue to the allying firms with the belated entry of a market leader firm. Furthermore, we discovered that a firm's entry into an OIA increases, rather than decreases, the market valuation of its rivals. Interestingly, an incumbent rival that did not participate in the alliance appears to gain greater ""free-riding"" benefits from the OIA, as compared to peer rivals. Innovation type and openness were significantly associated with the amount of abnormal returns accruing to allying firms, while no significance was found for partner heterogeneity. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for research and practice with respect to value cocreation in multifirm environments.";5;Computer;Ref598;Q1;2012
This GE ecomagination Challenge case study takes place in 2010 when Beth Comstock, chief marketing officer and senior vice president of General Electric, was planning a meeting with GE's CEO Jeffrey Immelt The pair plan to discuss the company's ecomagination Challenge, an open innovation process that solicited energy ideas from individuals and startups to identify potential ventures in green and renewable energy areas for GE to invest in. By 201 I, the ecomagination Challenge had resulted in $140 million (out of its allocated $200 million) of investments in 23 ventures. However, the scale of these results was dwarfed by GE's $37 billion energy business. So the time has come for Comstock to evaluate the results of the ecomagination Challenge more carefully and decide on whether and how to continue this kind of activity within GE's energy business, or in other GE businesses. How should GE measure ecomagination's results in order to justify its existence and possible future investments? What new processes and structures would be required to make sure that some of the Challenge's investments would pay off for GE down the rood? Based on the program's results to date, was the program a good investment for GE and something GE should repeat or was it a noble experiment that should be discontinued?;3;Business;Ref599;Q1;2012
Introduction. The paper deals with the topic of increasing integration of individuals and companies in innovation processes by means of Web-based software platforms. We consider why people participate and contribute in platforms and the characteristics of the platforms and the possible managerial actions (i.e., the drivers for motivations) to enhance these motivations? Method. An empirical qualitative analysis of twenty important platforms, leading to a cause-effect map of drivers and motivations. Both primary data (from a Delphi study and interviews) and secondary data (documents, Website explanations, etc.) were used. Analysis. Qualitative analysis was used to examine the interactions between specific drivers for enhancing specific motivations. Results. Nine groups of drivers, classified into three groups, were found. Strategies for driving the motivations that could encourage users to play an active role in the platforms are proposed. Conclusions. The findings could be useful for community managers and platform designers because they suggest choices for platform design that could attract potentially innovative participants and sustain a high level of collaboration for innovation-related contributions.;13;Information;Ref600;Q2;2012
The article presents an analysis of a large-scale survey with the aim of understanding differences in the open, interactive and distributed nature of external innovation relations amongst firms belonging to different industrial knowledge bases. The thesis is that the source of critical innovation relevant knowledge differs between industrial knowledge bases, making the character and the need of openness contingent on these specificities. Accordingly, we anticipate that we will observe systematic variations in how industries access and combine innovation-related external knowledge. In our analyses we attempt to address a gap in the literature by examining how industrial knowledge bases affect the recombination of knowledge by analysing the different extents, forms (formal and informal) and geography of inbound open innovation. The article illustrates that features and structures of inbound open innovation align, to a large extent, with the industries' knowledge bases and that there is a interplay between an industry's knowledge base, the internal organisation of innovation processes and the channels and geography of inbound open innovation.;3;Business;Ref601;Q1;2012
Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to examine the performance of firms in Peru in relation to entrepreneurial orientation and involvement in open innovation. Design/methodology/approach - Data were acquired through a survey of middle and senior managers employed in Peruvian companies. Findings - Firms achieving higher sales growth did not exhibit more of an entrepreneurial orientation or utilize a double loop learning style. More entrepreneurial firms appear to have adopted a double loop learning approach to knowledge acquisition. Peruvian firms involved in open innovation reported higher sales growth and indicated greater reliance on the use of double loop learning. Practical implications - The practical implications of the study are that firms in emerging economies do not have to be reliant on entrepreneurial behaviour to sustain business growth. Nevertheless involvement in open innovation can be beneficial. Originality/value - The originality of this paper is that although the results are only for companies in Peru, the findings may suggest that firms operating in emerging economies need not necessarily rely on entrepreneurial behaviour to sustain business growth, although involvement in open innovation may enhance business performance.;3;Business;Ref602;Q1;2012
R&D and innovation increasingly take place in networks beyond the boundaries of a single firm with customers in a more important role than in previous times. This new innovation model has been labelled as open innovation. In studies on innovation, learning mechanisms have largely remained a black box, causing difficulty in assessing what the benefits of open innovation might be. This paper examines a particular category of high-tech firms, university spin-offs, and illustrates resources that are missing and the level of openness in learning networks to gain these resources. Spin-off firms from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, are taken as a case study. Resource deficiency among these firms mainly concerns understanding and accessing the market, whereas the learning networks point to a negative impact of relatively closed networks (strong relationships, mainly local/regional orientation), thereby confirming the need for more open innovation. Next, the paper turns to an assessment of the potentials of certain types of open innovation to further enhance the growth of spin-off firms. The paper also identifies various new (or renewed) roles of city governments in promoting open innovation in a new scenario.;20;Sociology;Ref603;Q2;2012
Purpose - This paper aims to explore how community-controlled open innovation affects cost- and differentiation-based competitive advantage, and to explain how it allows some sources of economic rent to remain while others are taken away. Although models of competitive-advantage remain relevant, open innovation means that the main drivers of performance are changed. Open innovation means that there are implications for firms' ability to profit from intellectual property that they do not own. The paper seeks to address those issues. Design/methodology/approach - The work is conceptual. Findings - Economic rents from property rights disappear, those from economies of scale and capital requirements are reduced, but those from experience-curve effects, differentiation, distribution, and switching costs remain. Similarly, rents from the difficult-to-imitate resources of networks and reputation remain intact, and while those from employee knowhow and culture remain, they are likely to be in reduced amounts. Research limitations/implications - Propositions are provided for empirical testing. There also is a need to identify breakpoints between open-innovation benefits and the costs associated with lost innovation skills, and a need to extend this work to firm-controlled and third-party controlled open innovation. Practical implications - For some firms open innovation will not adversely affect competitive advantage but those whose advantage is driven by barriers to entry, skills in innovation and anticipating customer needs, or that rely on proprietary product designs, can lose in the longer term. Originality/value - Where the majority of work examining open innovation addresses property rights, economic rationales, governance, and processes, this work focuses on the effects of open innovation on strategy content and consequent firm performance.;3;Business;Ref604;Q1;2012
Purpose - This paper seeks to explore how market orientation facilitates the strategic flexibility of business models grounded in open innovation. The authors suggest that the new paradigm of open innovation may impact a firm's adaptability and responsiveness under conditions of environmental flux. However, extending innovation capacity by opening the innovation process poses major challenges for firms. The aims of this study are to explore the characteristics of open innovation activity and to contemplate the role of strategic flexibility in the design of business models based upon open innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The study draws upon a qualitative research approach through a longitudinal case study in the field of open source software (OSS). The empirical case illustrates how an OSS firm utilizes signals in its environment to flexibly alter its business model. Findings - A business model that embodies open innovation raises dilemmas between open and closed innovation paradigms. However, the authors' case highlights that an ambidextrous approach that combines market orientation with the principles of open innovation increases profitability, shortens time to market through effective market access, and enhances innovation capability. Research limitations/implications - The results have profound implications for industrial marketers, managers, management consultants and business educators. They can use the insights gleaned from this research to guide the development of business models that involve open innovation. The results indicate that firms involved in open innovation need reactive strategic flexibility to cope with the environmental diversity and variability. However, this study analyzes a single case in the field of OSS and one should be cautious when generalizing the findings. Originality/value - This paper improves the understanding of the relationship between flexibility and market orientation. It combines two areas that have previously been discussed separately, i.e. market orientation and open innovation.;3;Business;Ref605;Q1;2012
The steady growth of R&D costs and the increasingly widespread dissemination of information and communication technology over the past decade have resulted in the affirmation of the paradigm of open innovation, which consists in the continual expansion of access to sources of technological innovation outside the firm itself. Industrial companies are, in fact, turning more frequently to collaboration with university departments and other public and private research centers, and there is a notable increase in agreements regarding technological cooperation and the exchange of know-how between companies. In addition, recourse to highly specialized small research companies is on the rise. This is common, for example in the pharmaceutical sector and, more generally, in the area of biotechnological research. Furthermore, we are witnessing the development of the new role of innovation broker. These factors alter the traditional profile of company R&D structures, within which the role of researchers and technologists often changes. In particular, matrix and network organizational models are on the increase, and the professional figures of 'integrators of knowledge and expertise' (T-men) are assuming major importance at the expense of traditional scientists. As a consequence, the model for training and managing scientific personnel tends to change. This model, as it moves away from the prevailing pattern adopted by firms in Anglophone countries, is continually drawing closer, even from a cultural standpoint, to the R&D management approach found in the Japanese and German companies. The aim of this article is to investigate how the adoption of open innovation has changed the organizational structures of R&D and altered the methods used in managing its personnel. The results of the study are based on the analysis of four case studies of Italian multinational firms operating in the pharmaceutical, food, specialty chemical, and aerospace industries.;3;Business;Ref606;Q1;2012
China became the second-largest economy behind the USA in 2010. While there is quite some macroeconomic research documenting the technological catching-up of China as a nation, there is only little research studying how individual Chinese firms are catching up. This paper draws on the open innovation perspective to explore how Chinese firms improve their innovative performance. Our empirical analysis is based on a sample of 91 native Chinese firms in high-tech industries. The results indicate that Chinese firms widely implement an open innovation approach to strengthen their innovative performance. These firms use: 1 technology in-licensing agreements to obtain access to technologies 2 long-term alliances with foreign partners to access state-of-the-art technologies 3 collaboration with local universities and R&D institutes to broaden their technological strengths 4 collaboration with the local industrial community to deepen their technological skills.;8;Engineering;Ref607;Q1;2012
Purpose - The purpose of this study is to examine the current open innovation practices in the public sector of leading countries. Design/methodology/approach - Using a framework based on the role of the government in open innovation, this study analyses a profile of early open innovation adopters based on collected data from secondary sources. Findings - First, the USA, Australia and Singapore developed open innovation policies at the national level, facilitating a positive innovation climate. Many projects, especially those in online platforms, were established under these policies. Second, although outside-in open innovation principles seem to be popular, there have been emerging attempts to exploit the value of government data through inside-out approaches. Research limitations/implications - Most governments are in the early stages of adoption of open innovation and are in the process of understanding relevant issues. Future research should investigate how governments adopt open innovation, in particular inside-out initiatives. Practical implications - Governments should develop an overarching strategic plan, which would help its employees to recognise that new change is consistent with the needs of their workplace practices. Some organizations and projects led by citizens help the government engage external ideas in solving issues that are beyond its control. Originality/value - This study is the first attempt to examine the current open innovation policies at the government level.;3;Business;Ref608;Q1;2012
Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the unclear relationship between industry structure and open innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The focus of the study is on firms that received external help to develop their products or that helped third parties in developing their products. The hypotheses were tested on a large panel of more than 7,000 firms using generalized estimating equations. Findings - The results show that open innovation adoption is positively related to technology complexity and market uncertainty while it is negatively related to market concentration. Larger firms are more likely to adopt open innovation strategies. Originality/value - The research makes an important contribution to the literature by examining on a large sample of firms the moderating effects of industry concentration, industry research and development intensity and the technology life cycle stage on the adoption of open innovation.;3;Business;Ref609;Q1;2012
Collaborating with peers to gain access to knowledge is an attractive alternative for organizations keen to improve their innovativeness, and the rising popularity of open innovation has resulted in the emergence of new actors in the innovation process. Previous research focuses mainly on the firms that collaborate with these actors. This paper adopts the perspective of an open innovation actor and the managerial challenges involved. It is based on a case study of SAFER, a Swedish traffic and vehicle safety research unit with 22 collaborating partners. The unit, which is here called an open innovation arena, differs from an intermediary in that it both enables open innovation within a specific field of expertise and envisages itself as a key player in that same field. The case study reveals three types of challenges for the management of an open innovation arena: challenges that arise at the interface with partner organizations, challenges related to collaboration between the partners, and challenges related to the arena itself.;3;Business;Ref610;Q1;2011
Open innovation describes how organizations open up their innovation processes for external influence and collaboration. Despite this recent, and increasingly popular, development in the industry as well as in academic literature, the field lacks valid assessment tools. As a supportive organizational climate is argued to be a crucial element for successful implementation of open innovation, we propose in this paper Open Innovation Climate Measure (OICM). This three-dimensional assessment tool is tested in three units located in a multinational automotive corporation in the process of incorporating open innovation principles in practice.;3;Business;Ref611;Q1;2011
"The world's developed economies are increasingly oriented around services, with services comprising more than 70% of aggregate gross domestic product and employment in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. As a result, both individual companies and entire economies face the challenge of how to innovate in services. In earlier work, the author has argued for the concept of open innovation - that companies should both organize their innovation processes to be more open to external knowledge and ideas and also let more of their ideas and knowledge flow to the outside when not being used internally. Yet initial discussion of open innovation contrasted it to traditional R&D and product development; this had the effect of placing the focus more on product and technology innovation than on service innovation. Open innovation works somewhat differently in service businesses, in part because the role of the customer is different; in a service business, the customer is often involved in an iterative process with the company that results in a customer experience. In addition, innovation processes work differently in services. Few companies have formal R&D operations for the services they provide, and the customer may need to participate throughout the service innovation process. Some of the concepts of open innovation apply readily to service innovation. For example, Amazon. com has not only created open service innovation by bringing the ""outside in"" - think of customer reviews on Amazon.com and third parties selling products via Amazon's site - but also by taking the ""inside out,"" by, for example, using internal knowledge and infrastructure to create a business selling cloud computing services to other companies. Companies interested in moving toward open service innovation can try techniques such as working closely with customers to develop new solutions for them; focusing offerings on utility for customers, rather than on products; and embedding the company in a customer's organization. Companies that have traditionally been product oriented may need to make some organizational changes, such as changing service pricing, as they move to a more service-oriented approach.

While drawing on theories of distributed innovation and search, we conjecture that because a lot of important knowledge can only be obtained through the use of a product, the use of customer knowledge is beneficial for firms' innovative performance. However, the use of customer knowledge also has an important downside as customers may often be conservative (for many good reasons), forcing producer firms to search for new solutions along established paths, while shying away from truly new and promising opportunities. In this paper these two forces are reconciled through an argument stating that there is an inverse U-shaped relationship between the intensity of the use of customer knowledge and innovative performance. We hypothesize that the negative effect at high levels of intensity of the use of customer knowledge is offset by firms' broader search strategies in terms of the breadth of external search among other sources of innovation: If firms search more broadly among several sources of innovation, they are much more likely to enjoy the benefits of customer knowledge, while avoiding important negative aspects. Overall, we find empirical support for these conjectures.;9;Environmental;Ref613;Q1;2011
This study explores how the motivation and knowledge of individuals participating in innovation projects broadcast on the Internet affect their contribution performance. By analyzing a data set that combines information from the content analysis of postings and matched survey data from contributors, we find that extrinsic and intrinsic motivations affect the number of different types of contributions to solution threads. While extrinsic desire for monetary rewards tends to be positively related to the making of non-substantial contributions, intrinsic enjoyment tends to breed more substantial postings, and knowledge diversity facilitates all types of contributions to open innovation projects. This study also finds support for interaction effects between motivation and knowledge diversity. We identify the most valuable contributors as those who combine high levels of intrinsic enjoyment in contributing with a cognitive base fed from diverse knowledge domains. Our research complements emerging findings on the individual performance of external problem solvers in crowdsourcing and broadcast search. The findings will be useful for platform managers striving to attract potentially valuable participants to ensure high levels of substantial contributions to innovation challenges.

This paper addresses a major gap in reported research on open innovation (OI): how do companies implement open innovation? To answer this question a sample of 43 cross-sector firms were reviewed for their OI implementation approaches. The study analyzed how firms moved from practising closed to open innovation, classifying the adoption path according to the impetus for the adoption of the OI paradigm and the coordination of the OI implementation. The way firms adopted OI was found to vary according to (1) their innovation requirements, (2) the timing of the implementation and (3) their organizational culture. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

With the increasing trend towards collaborations for innovation across organizational boundaries, the strategic gravity of exploring potential technology partners has been accentuated in the paradigm of open innovation. However, as the openness across nations or industries has become broad, the conventional approaches to searching external partners have encountered a number of difficulties. Therefore, this paper aims to propose a systematic approach to searching potential technology partners using patent information which is accessible from anywhere. To specify the meaning of patented inventions more specifically, the inter-relationships of words in patent documents are taken into account, instead of simple use of technological keywords. The design of the proposed approach is comprised of three consecutive steps: data collection and preprocessing, transforming patent documents into co-occurrence vectors with the aid of text mining technique and domain experts, and deriving potential technology partners via a similarity indicator. A case study of the automatic car washing technology has shown that this method has advantages over the conventional keyword-based patent analysis in terms of significance. It is believed that the suggested approach can facilitate decision making in technology partner selection, and can serve as a starting point for a more general model.;11;Government;Ref618;Q4;2011
There are several tools in the literature that support innovation in organizations. Some of the most cited are the so-called technology roadmapping methods, also known as TRM. However, these methods are designed primarily for organizations that adopt the market pull strategy of technology-product integration. Organizations that adopt the technology push integration strategy are neglected in the literature. Furthermore, with the advent of open innovation, it is possible to note the need to consider the adoption of partnerships in the innovation process. Thus, this study proposes a method of technology roadmapping, identified as method for technology push (MTP), applicable to organizations that adopt the technology push integration strategy, such as SMEs and independent research centers in an open-innovation environment. The method was developed through action-research and was assessed from two analytical standpoints: externally, via a specific literature review on its theoretical contributions, and internally, through the analysis of potential users' perceptions on the feasibility of applying MTP. The results indicate both the unique character of the method and its perceived implementation feasibility. Future research is suggested in order to validate the method in different types of organizations (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;8;Engineering;Ref619;Q1;2011
Companies and research institutes are always threatened by rapid technological developments and corporate M&A. They are trying to secure a sustainable competitive advantage using outside knowledge and expertise under open innovation to overcome these shortcomings. As a quantitative and systematical method of selecting virtual team members for open innovation, we present a virtual team formation model and a prototype to verify its efficiency. The test scenario shows how to form a virtual team through internal and external human resources when developing a new product. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;5;Computer;Ref620;Q1;2011
By comparing Lucent Technologies and Cisco Systems over twenty years, one illustrates that a firm that outsources exploration through an Acquisition and Development (A&D) strategy of start-ups and exploitation specialization can be more innovative and competitive than an ambidextrous organization. The success of an A&D strategy depends on the embeddedness of the firm in the network of organizations comprised of an open innovation system and supported by an inter-organizational process of innovation. The embeddedness of Cisco Systems in the ambidextrous high-tech cluster of the Silicon Valley, especially its ties to venture capital firms and start-ups, explains the success of its MID strategy. The spreading of A&D strategy among large firms reinforces the dynamics of the open innovation system and nurtures the cluster's ambidexterity by increasing incentives for other organizations and individuals of the network to explore new knowledge and create fresh start-ups.

"This article examines current developments in the field of CAI. The field of CAI has been driven by two major recent developments. One being the technological possibilities in the software field commonly referred to as ""Web 2.0"". The other being a strategic paradigm shift from closed to open innovation in many companies. Both developments lead to a new form of CAI which have been analyzed in detail and named Open CAI 2.0. This paper discusses the benefits and challenges for software providers and users arising from this new evolutionary step of CAI. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

"Extant research demonstrates that e-Government initiatives often fall short of achieving innovative forms of government and governance due to a techno-centric focus that limits such initiatives to minor improvements in service delivery. While it is evident that innovation is central to modernising and transforming governmental organisations, and that the co-creation of services by public authorities and community groups is an essential component of realising the benefits of investment in information and communication technology, there is little research focusing on the nature of innovation in transforming governmental organisations and services. Addressing this gap in the literature, this paper explores how open innovation strategies can transform public administration by examining how a network of municipalities in Sweden transforms value creation and service delivery by collaborating with each other and with external parties to accelerate the creation and exploitation of innovation. Using a case study with embedded units of analysis, four emerging typologies of governmental transformation based on open innovation are identified. The paper illustrates how these open innovation typologies (i) transform the organisation of the municipalities and (ii) help them deliver high quality co-created services to citizens. By examining the strategic and operational aspects that facilitate such activities, the analysis reveals the impact of open innovation on the business models of public authorities. The paper concludes that open innovation practices represent a more radical manifestation of transformational government than previously envisaged; signalling not only fundamental change in the nature of value creation and service delivery by public authorities, but potentially in the nature of their organisation.

Significant attention has been given to advancing cyber-infrastructures to support virtual engineering and science communities based on the proposition that virtual organizations can more effectively create and leverage knowledge due to diverse information, skills, and resources to enhance capacity to innovate. Yet, relatively little is known about desirable organizing processes in virtual open science communities. To this end, a simulation-based exploratory study is conducted to better understand the conditions that confer increased rates of innovation in such socio-technical systems. Three types of open science communities are identified and simulated using agent simulation as a method of inquiry. Simulation results show that centrality, as a measure of degree of connectedness, correlates with innovation output in exploratory and service communities up to a point. Also, utility-oriented communities have social network structures with low density and high centrality, which suggest high potential for innovation.;5;Computer;Ref624;Q3;2011

The concept of open innovation has recently gained widespread attention. It is particularly relevant now because many firms are required to implement open innovation, despite the difficulties associated with managing these activities. After providing a definition of open innovation delimiting it from open source, an overview of prior research is given, which identifies the following important topics of earlier open innovation research: technology transactions, user innovation, business models, and innovation markets. In light of current controversial debates about the value of the open innovation framework, we evaluate the literature and assess whether open innovation is a sustainable trend rather than a management fashion. On this basis, we present a conceptual framework that provides the foundation for discussing critical open innovation processes and their implications for managing open innovation at the organizational, project, and individual level. Thus, we assess the multilevel determinants of the make-or-buy, integrate-or-relate, and keep-or-sell decisions in opening up the innovation process. Then, we propose a research agenda based on this conceptual framework with particular emphasis on the organizational antecedents and performance consequences of open innovation and on important research design issues. Finally, we discuss implications for management education and practice, and we provide a conclusion and outlook.;3;Business;Ref626;Q1;2011
"The concept of open innovation, building upon ideas of ""interactive innovation"" and ""innovation networking"" has gained interest more recently. It argues that companies should increasingly also rely on ideas and knowledge developed externally, and create external paths for innovation. There are various mechanisms used by companies for acquiring external knowledge such as R&D and innovation collaboration with other firms and universities, relations to spin-off companies, and informal knowledge interactions within local milieux and ""open innovation campuses"". Open innovation and networking are no general phenomena but depend on certain company and regional characteristics such as the respective innovation culture. The interrelationship between open innovation and regional culture has been explored by studies on regional advantage emphasizing socio-cultural aspects of opening up innovation, the literature on regional clusters, emphasizing knowledge sharing in networks, and the contributions to regional innovation systems, emphasizing the role of the institutional environment. We investigate examples of open innovation for different regions of Europe including high-tech and low-tech industries: The Southeast region of The Netherlands (high-tech systems centred on Philips and performance materials centred on DSM), Basel (Life Science industry focused on Novartis and other firms) and Styria (metal industry). We analyse the ways and mechanisms at work for open innovation, and the way these are related to regional culture. We find that open innovation strategies of companies benefit from certain regional culture characteristics and that there is no uniform ""model of open innovation that applies to all types of regions"". Region-specific solutions and policies are required that account for divergent regional conditions. The research shows that we rarely find the ideal model of ""uncontrolled"" open innovation, but rather different forms of innovation practices that are somewhere in between the open and the closed model. Both corporate cultures and regional cultures in the regions studied still show many aspects hampering open innovation, underlining that change towards a culture facilitating open innovation takes considerable time.";9;Environmental;Ref627;Q1;2011
The development and installation of new process equipment in production plants typically requires strong collaboration among a process firm and various equipment suppliers. While incentives to collaborate often are strong, close collaboration also poses significant problems, throughout the lifecycle of process equipment. The purpose of this article is to explore the problems and opportunities faced by process firms and their equipment suppliers throughout the lifecycle stages of collaborative development projects. This paper combines literature on open innovation, collaborative development and buyer-supplier relationships. Empirically, we draw on a large number of interviews in a dual case study of two process firms. Our results show that strong collaboration is neither positive nor negative in general. Rather, opportunities, problems, and collaboration intensity are strongly contingent on the specific stage in the lifecycle of process equipment. Our findings underscore the managerial and theoretical importance of a lifecycle perspective on the development of process equipment, since significant overlaps and interconnections exist across different stages.;8;Engineering;Ref628;Q1;2011
In recent years, Chinese science and technology (S&T) intermediaries have grown rapidly to become the important components of the market-driven economy. In this study, we analyse the characteristics of the Chinese S&T intermediary system and government support policies with regards to the S&T intermediaries' roles from three aspects of the evolution of technology innovation, the enterprise lifecycle and the enterprise R&D paradigm. To investigate the demands typically placed on S&T intermediaries by Chinese enterprises, we have questioned the selected information technology enterprises in Beijing and Jiangsu provinces. Research shows that demands on S&T intermediaries differ between large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises. Furthermore, the Chinese government and enterprises value the S&T intermediary for its function of nurturing the evolution of technology and the enterprise, but overlook its role in open innovation. To address this gap, this research will then help policy makers to better understand how to improve the performance of S&T intermediaries under the open innovation paradigm.;3;Business;Ref629;Q2;2011
In this paper, we discuss whether, and to what extent, open innovation is a relevant perspective for policymakers seeking to foster innovation and entrepreneurship. Our analysis and discussion are structured around the authors' evaluation of a publicly co-sponsored industry incubator programme that focuses on theoretical ideas from the open innovation model. Based on our empirical example, we conclude that open innovation policies may be implemented through a hands-on approach, in which the ultimate goal is to preserve and retain knowledge that has an economic value to society, but which large corporations choose not to exploit. By acting as open innovation intermediaries, the publicly supported incubators in our example were able to transfer knowledge from large firms to society. Most of these activities would not have taken place without the incubators, suggesting a high degree of additionality.;3;Business;Ref630;Q2;2011
"This paper provides a review of the current state of academic and policy-level debates on ""open innovation"" by elaborating on the relevance of the concept of open innovation for innovation policy-making in catching-up economies. The paper shows that paradoxes and contradictions exist between the ""mainstream"" innovation discourse and the development challenges of the catching-up countries that have lead to ""de-contextualization"" of the innovation policy discourse. The paper argues that applying the concept of open innovation in its ideal-type form to the catching-up context is likely to reinforce these de-contextualization tendencies. This problem can be remedied by more conscious attention to the basic contradictions and paradoxes, which requires a more comprehensive and systemic analytical focus on innovation and technological development at the levels of firm, industry and policy.";20;Sociology;Ref631;Q2;2011
"There has been a paradigm shift to a knowledge-oriented economy in the 21st century. Consequently, there has also been a shift in where innovation typically occurs. This shift has been from the production site toward the process of product diffusion. That is, innovation occurs more frequently at the point at which a product or service is moved into the marketplace where it is immediately modified through customer interaction. In this process, new ""functionality"" - services, the delivery method or even product changes occur in the diffusion process. Given the need to constantly create new value through new product ""functionality"" or new ""functionality development"", firm strategy must address the issue of how to enhance innovation at this new locus - the diffusion process. Sustainable new functionality development over time has become crucial to a firm's competitiveness. In this context, firms have to develop new functionality as early and quickly as possible: leveraging whatever innovation exists in the marketplace. According to theory, the early emergence of functionality development in this context depends on a dynamic system in which the imitator (follower) is constantly substituting for the innovator (leader). This substitution corresponds to the dynamics observed in the process referred to as ""open innovation"". According to this theory, functionality development through follower substitution for a leader would be critical for a firm's competitiveness in the open innovation environment. Furthermore, open innovation could be a process for sustaining the ongoing creation of new value through functionality development maximizing limited resources. This paper attempts to demonstrate this hypothesis through an empirical analysis of this process of substitution in major innovative goods and services in Japan. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the ability of open innovation and intra-organisational learning mechanisms to spur technological innovation capability. Accordingly, this study devises a multi-level model for examining the links between contextual variables and collects data via a multi-informant questionnaire. This study applies hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) to examine three hypotheses. Using a matched dyadic data set from a study of 328 R&D employees and 33 supervisors sampled from 33 biotechnology firms, the HLM results clearly demonstrate how open innovation moderates the relationship between internal learning and technological innovation capability. These results suggest that internal learning strengthens the technological innovation capabilities of an R&D team. Specifically, the relationship between internal learning and technological innovation capability is stronger when R&D teams adopt open innovation. Moreover, this paper offers a contribution to understanding the cross-level and external-internal aspects of open innovation by adding multi-level analysis of biotechnology firms.;3;Business;Ref633;Q2;2011
The Open Innovation (OI) paradigm has emphasized the role of external knowledge in aiding internal R&D efforts. While most research based on this model has focused on high-tech sectors, this paper attempts to extend it to more mature industries. The study also analyzes a wide range of OI strategies and their relationships with different innovation outcomes. The empirical results, based on a large sample of Spanish manufacturing firms, show that OI strategies are highly effective tools for making internal R&D efforts more successful, both in high- and low-tech sectors. In addition, the study finds evidence that market-based strategies are positively correlated to achieving process innovations, while partnering strategies have a similar relationship with product innovations. More formalized OI strategies, such as joint ventures, show positive relations with the achievement of patent results.;3;Business;Ref634;Q3;2010
Firms increasingly adopt an open innovation model in which they rely on technology alliances to complement and supplement their internal innovation efforts. Although previous studies provide in-depth insight into the impact of technology alliances on the innovation performance, they remain relatively silent on how technology alliances eventually influence the financial performance of the firm. The purpose of this paper is to develop and test a conceptual framework that disentangles both the value-enhancing and cost-increasing effects of technology alliances on financial performance. The model was tested with a sample of 305 Belgian manufacturing firms. Combining data from the Belgian Community Information Survey (CIS IV) database and the BELFIRST database, structural equation analyses were conducted on the connection among technology alliance portfolio diversity, product innovation performance, and financial performance. This study's data provide empirical confirmation for the assumption of existing research that technology alliance portfolio diversity has an indirect positive impact on financial performance via increased product innovation performance. However, a direct cost-increasing effect of technology alliance portfolio diversity on financial performance is observed. Moreover, the structural equation analyses suggest that, in the short-term, the direct cost-increasing effect of technology alliance portfolio diversity exceeds the indirect value-generating effect of technology alliances. These findings contribute to the current research on open innovation in two important ways. First, these results support the open innovation model by illuminating the interconnectedness between internal and external innovation strategies. In particular, technology alliance portfolio diversity has a positive impact on internal innovation efforts, which increases product innovation performance. Second, the findings complement the focus of existing open innovation research on the value-generating properties of technology alliances, directing attention to the cost-increasing effects of such collaborative strategies. On a managerial level, these findings suggest that, when making technology alliance decisions, managers not only should consider the potential benefits of such collaborative strategies but also should take into account the additional costs of intensifying the technology alliance portfolio.;3;Business;Ref635;Q1;2010
A critical success factor in the practice of Open Innovation is the timely identification of opportunities for out-licensing a firm's technologies outside its core business. This can be particularly challenging for small- and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs), because of their focussed business portfolio, specialized knowledge basis, and limited financial resources that can be devoted to innovation activities. The paper illustrates a quick and easy-to-use methodology for the identification of viable opportunities for out-licensing a firm's technologies outside its core business. The method uses established TRIZ instruments in combination with non-financial weighting and ranking techniques and portfolio management tools. It has been developed by the authors in collaboration with an Italian SME working in the packaging industry.;3;Business;Ref636;Q1;2010
"Open innovation (OI) has become a mainstream organizational process. Firms are establishing OI groups, allocating budgets, and measuring results. In this article, we identify twelve ""good practices"" associated with high quality open innovation efforts. In our experience, these practices are key inputs to the firm's OI system, leading to high quality results when effectively executed. The goal of this article is to help management build the practices into their OI system and make continuous improvements in their OI processes.";3;Business;Ref637;Q1;2010
This article examines the impact of the emerging model of open innovation on state public policy, particularly the practice of technology-based economic development in weak research and development (R&D) states. Open innovation describes the nascent practice of firms using knowledge created outside their boundaries and also marketing ideas they would not commercialize themselves. Firms engaging in open innovation thrive on knowledge spillovers, and weak R&D regions could benefit from this model through the creation of Marshallian externalities. It is therefore interesting to ask whether weak R&D states take advantage of this model. This case study analysis shows that states involved in the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research partially support the emerging open innovation paradigm. All states have science and technology strategies and actively support and invest in their higher education infrastructure. They show variation in their support for university-industry partnerships, entrepreneurship, capital access, commercialization, and technology transfer. None of the states, however, uses the open innovation framework explicitly.;6;Development;Ref638;Q1;2010
In light of the recent economic crisis, many industrial firms attempt to capture additional value from their technologies by means of open innovation strategies. Besides acquiring external technology, many firms therefore increasingly try to license their own technology to other firms either exclusively or in addition to its application in their own products. This article shows that technology licensing offers important strategic benefits beyond generating licensing revenues, which underscore the need for an integrated management of technology licensing activities. Therefore, this article extends the concept of job-related markets that was recently developed in the managerial literature. A 'job' is the fundamental problem that a customer needs to resolve in a particular situation. Managers may transfer this job-related understanding to technology licensing activities because the right 'job' for a technology may be outside a firm's boundaries, and it may help firms to identify additional licensing opportunities. On this basis, the article presents the concept of an integrated technology exploitation roadmap, which allows firms to use the job-related markets to integrate technology licensing in their strategic planning processes. An example of a machinery firm shows how this roadmap may contribute to strengthening a firm's licensing business. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;8;Engineering;Ref639;Q1;2010
Institutional openness is becoming increasingly popular in practice and academia: open innovation, open R&D and open business models. Our special issue builds on the concepts, underlying assumptions and implications discussed in two previous R&D Management special issues (2006, 2009).

It also assesses some of the recent evidence that has come to light about open innovation, in theory and in practice.;3;Business;Ref640;Q1;2010
Open Innovation has been one of the most-debated topics in management research in the last decade. Although our understanding of this management paradigm has significantly improved over the last few years, a number of important questions are still unanswered. In particular, an issue that deserves further attention is the anatomy of the organizational change process through which a firm evolves from being a Closed to an Open Innovator. The paper represents a first step in overcoming this limitation. In particular, adopting a longitudinal, firm-level perspective, it addresses the following question: which changes in a firm's organizational structures and management systems does the shift from Closed to Open Innovation entail? In answering this question, the paper uses established concepts in organizational change research to look into a rich empirical basis that documents the adoption of Open Innovation by four Italian firms operating in mature, asset-intensive industries. The results show that the journey from Closed to Open Innovation involves four main dimensions of the firm's organization, i.e. inter-organizational networks, organizational structures, evaluation processes and knowledge management systems, along which change could be managed and stimulated.;3;Business;Ref641;Q1;2010
Automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) have historically invested in their own research and development (R&D) to boost their innovativeness. Because of an increasing innovation and cost pressure, the automotive industry needs to look outside their own boundaries to escape from this productivity dilemma. While there is a tendency to look outside for external sources to increase the innovativeness, there are hardly any external paths to market outside the current business yet. Our study shows that Open Innovation proves to be more adequate in the attempt to achieve a better R&D productivity for companies in the automotive industry than a closed innovation model.;3;Business;Ref642;Q1;2010
In the open innovation management literature, it is widely acknowledged that individuals play a crucial role in collaborative knowledge creation processes. However, the literature tends not to explore the human side of open innovation teams. The present article therefore examines the competencies that professionals need for working in open innovation teams (specific but not necessarily unique to open innovation) and to cope with the challenges they face. A qualitative study consisting of explorative interviews and focus group discussions was conducted, resulting in a competence profile for open innovation professionals. The profile adds a new perspective to the field of open innovation management by focusing on how individuals involved in open innovation teams can enhance open innovation success. It reveals, among other things, how professionals can generate new knowledge, build trust, and deal with low reciprocal commitment in open innovation teams. Especially, brokering solutions and being socially competent seem to be important for open innovation professionals. Companies should focus on these competencies when supporting their professionals in open innovation teams.;3;Business;Ref643;Q1;2010
"The current open innovation literature needs to be complemented with work on the managerial challenges faced by companies working with an innovation intermediary to solve research and development (R&D) problems. Based on an exploratory case study design, we investigate these managerial challenges in seven chemical companies working with the same innovation intermediary. Three recurring challenges were identified in all companies: (1) enlisting internal scientists to work with the innovation intermediary; (2) selecting the right problems; and (3) formulating problems so as to enable novel solutions. Based on the knowledge management literature, we explain how these challenges arise out of scientists' different work practices in internal vs. external R&D problem solving and we identify and discuss a number of remedies to these challenges.";3;Business;Ref644;Q1;2010
This case study examines a global pharmaceutical company widely using open innovation (OI). Three main research questions are addressed: (1) what OI concepts are salient in their innovation portfolio?, (2) what OI concepts are used in the strategy formulation? and (3) what other concepts are present that augment OI? Interviews with 120 managers and archival documents were analyzed using thematic analysis. Two concepts prominent in the literature, (i) value capture models and (ii) technology evaluation criteria, were not present in this portfolio. By contrast, we found a focus on OI capability building, external information sharing and uncertain knowledge arbitrage in networks. Finally, we discuss these capabilities in relation to absorptive capacity, proposing a simple, but important bi-directional perspective to embrace OI.;3;Business;Ref645;Q1;2010
OVERVIEW: How to achieve a sustained competitive advantage that ensures long-term survival is a major concern for managers everywhere, but even more so for those in smaller firms, which may have more difficulty enduring under hostile environmental conditions than larger organizations. Because innovation is a key driver of sustained competitive advantage and sustainable business growth, the management of innovation is a central concern for these firms. While research in innovation management has provided many insights into specific aspects of innovation, the encompassing problems confronting general managers, especially managers of small and medium-size firms, have been overlooked in the development of innovation management tools. As a case study in the value of innovation management techniques and tools in the development of a collaborative innovation network, this paper analyzes the use of innovation management techniques and tools by a leading Spanish elevator manufacturer's research unit in implementing its open innovation strategy. This empirical study will help managers to understand the role of innovation management tools in structuring an open innovation strategy based on collaboration and technology transfer.;3;Business;Ref646;Q1;2010

Our study aims at shedding light on the innovative business strategies in the software sector and understanding better the economics that underlies the supply of Open Source Software (OSS). We use survey data collected from 170 Finnish software companies to investigate how different properties of software firms, such as size, age, intellectual capital, absorptive capacity, and ownership structure affect their decisions to base their business strategies on OSS supply or proprietary distribution of products and services. Our empirical findings indicate that the adoption of technologically advanced strategies requiring complex legal and managerial knowledge, such as the OSS supply strategy, demands relatively highly educated employees. The support for and development of an education system providing highly skilled people from different fields are essential for the firms' successful adoption of innovative business strategies. We also find that market entrants have largely driven the OSS adoption, but there are no significant age-related differences in the adoption behavior of incumbent software firms.

A practitioner-oriented work model, named the open Stage-Gate model, can exploit the advantages of ""openness."" This model allows explicit consideration of import and export of know-how and technology through gate evaluations and also enables firms to continuously assess their core capabilities and business model.

"One of the key elements of Fiat's recent resurgence is the superiority of its clean, fuel-efficient engine technologies that were mostly developed during the 1990s by Centro Ricerche Fiat (CRF), the Fiat Group company in charge of R&D and technology development. In the early 1990s, when the Italian carmaker was going through troubling times (along with many other players in the automotive industry), CEO Gian Carlo Michellone radically turned around CRF's organization and innovation strategy, adopting and mastering a strategic approach to innovation that resembles what would become known as the open innovation paradigm. This revolution allowed the Fiat Group to keep its ""innovation engine"" running, despite the heavy downturn of the industry. The CRF case demonstrates how open innovation can protect the firm's innovation capability from the risk of severe resource rationalizations during periods of crisis while proffering a starting point to replicate innovation capability once the downturn is over. The efforts to streamline the adoption of open innovation need to be targeted at several aspects of a firm's organization, i.e. the structures, organizational roles, the planning and control and performance management systems, corporate values, and individual competencies and attitudes. The role played by the senior executive leadership in promoting the successful implementation of open innovation is critical, especially during tough economic times.";3;Business;Ref650;Q1;2010
"The value of the open innovation approach is now widely recognized, and the practice has been extensively researched, but still very little is known about the relative impact of firm-level and laboratory-level open innovation policies and practices on R&D performance. This study attempts to measure that impact by analyzing a sample of 203 laboratories of Japanese firms located in Japan. It examines simultaneously the effects of firm-level open innovation policy and laboratory-level external collaborations on laboratory R&D performance. The study aims to go beyond a general understanding of the importance of open innovation; it shows how an open innovation policy can have a positive and significant effect on collaborations between a laboratory and local universities or business organizations. The results also show how an open innovation policy can contribute to the laboratory's R&D performance by facilitating external collaborations by the laboratories. It demonstrates how these factors affect R&D performance in different ways, depending on the type of R&D tasks. Our findings suggest several theoretical and practical implications in the field of R&D management.";3;Business;Ref651;Q1;2010
"In spite of increasing interest in open innovation, discussion about the concept and its potential application to the SME sector has been excluded from mainstream literature. However, given that the argument about the effect of firm size on the effectiveness of innovation is still ongoing, it is Worth addressing the issue from an SME perspective. That is the focus of this article, which seeks, firstly, to place the concept of open innovation in the context of SMEs; secondly to suggest the input of an intermediary in facilitating innovation; and finally to report accounts of Korean SMEs' success in working with an intermediary. The research results support the potential of open innovation for SMEs, and indicate networking as one effective way to facilitate open innovation among SMEs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

"The aim of this article is to suggest a framework for examining the way national policy mixes are responding to the challenges and opportunities of globally distributed knowledge networks, cross-sectoral technology flows and consequently open innovation processes occurring on an international scale. We argue that the purpose of public research and innovation policy remains one of developing and sustaining territorial knowledge bases capable of growing and supporting internationally competitive industries. But the rules of the game have changed. Public policy now needs to carefully balance between: a) promoting the formation of international linkages for knowledge sourcing and information exposure; b) providing incentives for domestic industry intramural R&D for building absorptive capacity and knowledge accumulation; and c) sustaining domestic networking to allow accumulated knowledge to diffuse and recombine.";9;Environmental;Ref653;Q1;2010
Open source software (OSS) is probably the best known exemplar of open innovation, with many practitioner-oriented publications having debated the merits and drawbacks of OSS in recent years. Nevertheless, much of the academic research on OSS has focused on individual rather than organizational issues. Hence while there is some understanding of why individual developers and users opt for particular OSS applications, relatively little is known about the adoption of OSS as a software acquisition policy. This paper presents a study of 13 managers in the secondary software sector in Europe, and examines how their perceptions of the benefits and drawbacks of OSS affected their decision to adopt an open source policy for software in their companies. The study reveals how their perceptions of the business and technical benefits and drawbacks of OSS influenced the technological, organizational, environmental and individual factors considered within the adoption process. The findings reveal that many of these factors are similar to those reported by previous work on the adoption of innovation, leading us to conclude that organizational processes for the adoption of open innovation are reliant on the practices for closed innovation despite frequently cited loss of organizational control associated with open innovation.;5;Computer;Ref654;Q1;2010
"The explosive growth of the Internet has led to a dramatic increase in data sources for (competitive) technology intelligence. Appropriate implementation and use of IT tools to gather and analyze these data is of key importance for the creation of actionable technology intelligence. A strategy to optimize investments in the identified technologies becomes of paramount importance if an organization wants to match knowledge and ideas originating from outside of the organization with internal core competences. Such a strategy can create competitive advantage by effectively linking technology intelligence to open innovation. We show how VIB, a life sciences research organization, has established technology intelligence processes to identify a multitude of external technologies of interest, which are subsequently ""probed"" for their potential and fit with VIB using real options reasoning, thereby supporting open innovation. Our methodology may be useful for other organizations which are considering implementing open innovation approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.";3;Business;Ref655;Q1;2010
"The discussion on open innovation suggests that the ability to absorb external knowledge has become a major driver for competition. For R&D intensive large firms, the concept of open innovation in relation to absorptive capacity is relatively well understood. Little attention has: however, been paid to how both small firms and firms, which operate in traditional sectors, engage in open innovation activities. The latter two categories of firms often dispose of no, or at most a relatively low level of, absorptive capacity. Open innovation has two faces. In the case of inbound open innovation, companies screen their environment to search for technology and knowledge and do not exclusively rely on in-house R&D. A key pre-condition is that firms dispose of ""absorptive capacity"" to internalise external knowledge. SMEs and firms in traditional industries might need assistance in building absorptive capacity. This paper focuses on the role of collective research centres in building absorptive capacity at the inter-organisational level. In order to do so, primary data was collected through interviews with CEOs of these technology intermediaries and their member firms and analysed in combination with secondary data. The technology intermediaries discussed are created to help firms to take advantage of technological developments. The paper demonstrates that the openness of the innovation process forces firms lacking absorptive capacity to search for alternative ways to engage in inbound open innovation. The paper highlights the multiple activities of which absorptive capacity in intermediaries is made up; defines the concept of absorptive capacity as a pre-condition to open innovation; and demonstrates how firms lacking absorptive capacity collectively cope with distributed knowledge and innovation.

In this first paper of the special issue, we identify some trends in open innovation research by analysing how the literature on this topics has evolved since the introduction of the concept in 2003. Research on open innovation has been mushrooming ever since and the scope has been broadened in different directions. Researchers also started to analyse open innovation at different level of analysis from the individual actors in organisations to ecosystems and national innovation systems. Despite the vast growth in research on open innovation, we identified several directions for further research: open innovation research should be linked to other management areas such as marketing, HRM, change management, etc. In addition, our understanding of open innovation could be improved if the recently developed insights could be related to the existing management theories.;8;Engineering;Ref657;Q1;2010
Most previous successful open innovation cases originated from large enterprises that have the ability to invest heavily in research and development (R&D) and to generate many new ventures. Conversely, we find only very few successful case studies of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The difference in the number of cases makes us doubt the appropriateness of open innovation strategy for SMEs. In order to show the relevance of open innovation for SMEs, the current study analyses the impact of external activities related to open innovation on innovation output by means of a logistic regression and compares the results with those of large enterprises. Further investigation was done to assess the relative impact of the external activities by means of a Bayesian network method. In conclusion, the empirical analysis shows that not all open innovation activities of SMEs have a positive effect on their innovation output.;8;Engineering;Ref658;Q1;2010
We explore the relationship between firm performance and its strategic orientation in adopting an open-approach to innovation. Based on the description of previous author, we develop a multi-item construct to measure firm-level open innovation proclivity. Open innovation proclivity assesses the company's inclination to utilise external ideas to complement its business model to profit from innovations. This construct also measures the firm's tendency to sell its intellectual property to outsiders to profit from others' innovation efforts. Collecting survey data from multiple respondents with time lag from 122 Taiwanese electronic-product manufacturers, we find Taiwanese electronic companies' proclivity to open innovation relates positively to managers' perceived firm performance. We also find the entrepreneurial orientation of these companies positively moderates the relationship between open innovation proclivity and firm performance.;8;Engineering;Ref659;Q1;2010
This paper investigates open innovation for the development of complex products. In this context, systems integrators are firms that integrate component innovations into existing product systems and that design entirely new product architectures. To successfully execute these systems integration tasks, these firms need to monitor and absorb the rapid and diverse technological developments that surround them. Systems integration therefore explains why firms know more than they make. Open innovation, on its part, provides the mechanisms that indicate how firms can expand their knowledge boundary. Open innovation and systems integration are strong complements therefore. More specifically, a contingent and a balanced approach to open innovation is suggested: open as far as abundant component knowledge is concerned, and closed with respect to the generation and exploitation of scarce, internally developed architectural knowledge.;8;Engineering;Ref660;Q1;2010
We explore the technological evolution of three microprocessor firms between 1976 and 2004. We trace how two initially small entrants (Intel and AMD) competed against a larger and more established incumbent (IBM). We show that changes in interfirm relationships (as reflected by competitive and cooperative events) affect patenting strategies. Periods of increased competition correspond to greater patenting within patent classes in which the firms compete head-on. Periods of cooperation are surprisingly not always accompanied by increased patenting in complementary upstream and downstream areas. Despite changes in competitive regime, Intel and AMD exhibit a persistent dependence upon IBM for technology. Our study shows that small firms can compete against a large incumbent in the product market while being dependent upon external sources for knowledge. We also suggest ways in which incumbent firms operating in such environments (e. g., IBM) might engage with these entrants through co-opetition and open innovation.;8;Engineering;Ref661;Q1;2010
When individuals act in open innovation networks, their attributes are specifically crucial in respect of their success or failure to profit from the network. The empirical background of this research was a 16-month investigation of EURADOS, the successful European network for research on radiation dosimetry. EURADOS presently consists of almost 200 members from 52 European institutions in 31 countries. Not all EURADOS members profit equally from its open innovation network. Structural equation modelling provided an answer regarding the personal and organisational attributes that are required to profit from the network in terms of an increase in innovativeness, a reduction in costs and a better fulfilment of tasks in the home organisation. The attributes openness and the possibility to contribute influence the value that individuals derive from open innovation networks equally.;8;Engineering;Ref662;Q1;2010
The recent growth in inward and outward technology transfer, e. g., by means of technology licensing, reflects the new paradigm of open innovation. By actively acquiring and commercializing intellectual property in the technology markets, these open innovation processes contrast traditional closed innovation processes. Prior open innovation research has largely been limited to case studies and theoretical contributions, and other lines of research have focused either on inward or outward technology transfer without taking an integrative perspective. Therefore, I simultaneously consider inward and outward technology transfer as the two main directions of open innovation. On this basis, data from a survey of 154 industrial firms are used to test four hypotheses relating the size and quality of the corporate patent portfolio to a firm's extent of external technology acquisition and external technology commercialization. The results show that the corporate intellectual property portfolio constitutes a major determinant of opening up the innovation process.;8;Engineering;Ref663;Q1;2010
Open innovation is increasingly being adopted in business and describes a situation in which firms exchange ideas and knowledge with external participants, such as customers, suppliers, partner firms, and universities. This article extends the concept of open innovation with a push model of open innovation: knowledge is voluntarily created outside a firm by individuals and organisations who proceed to push knowledge into a firm's open innovation project. For empirical analysis, we examine source code and newsgroup data on the Eclipse Development Platform. We find that outsiders invest as much in the firm's project as the founding firm itself. Based on the insights from Eclipse, we develop four propositions: 'preemptive generosity' of a firm, 'continuous commitment', 'adaptive governance structure', and 'low entry barrier' are contexts that enable the push model of open innovation.;8;Engineering;Ref664;Q1;2010
Accounts of open source software (OSS) development projects frequently stress their democratic, sometimes even anarchic nature, in contrast to for-profit organisations. Given this observation, our research evaluates qualitative data from Wikipedia, a free online encyclopaedia whose development mechanism allegedly resembles that of OSS projects. Our research offers contributions to the field of open innovation research with three major findings. First, we shed light on Wikipedia as a phenomenon that has received scant attention from management scholars to date. Second, we show that OSS-related motivational mechanisms partially apply to Wikipedia participants. Third, our exploration of Wikipedia also reveals that its organisational mechanisms are often perceived as bureaucratic by contributors. This finding was unexpected since this type of problem is often associated with for-profit organisations. Such a situation risks attenuating the motivation of contributors and sheds a critical light on the nature of Wikipedia as a role model for open innovation processes.;8;Engineering;Ref665;Q1;2010
The traditional view of the innovation, which implies that companies innovate on their own, has been recently challenged by the 'open innovation' concept promoting the use of external knowledge. Collaboration between firms has always existed in one way or another, however, large-scale open innovation is now the next step for many companies. This article conducts a comparative analysis of the two largest open innovation structures: patent pools and open source. The issues of financial and non-financial benefits, appropriability, standards, cooperation, risks and feasibility are, in turn, discussed for each of the structures. Finally, a synthesis of the results is established and recommendations in regard to the adoption of these structures are given.;8;Engineering;Ref666;Q1;2010
Industrial change leading to industry convergence can be observed in many industries. This is provoked by the application of new technologies across industry boundaries, changing customer structures and regulations. Convergence presents a particular context for innovation and technology management, as firms face new bodies of technological and market knowledge which may create competence gaps. This paper asks the following question: what kind of innovation strategies do players with different industry backgrounds employ to address new industry segments resulting from industry convergence? By analysing three different industry cases of convergence, this paper explores how firms in different industries address competence gaps they face by positioning themselves in a newly emerging value chain. Empirical findings indicate that the innovation strategies which firms follow in converging industries may create conflicts with existing path-dependencies. Hence, to overcome these conflicts, open innovation built on dynamic capabilities (like alliance building) plays a major role in industry convergence.;8;Engineering;Ref667;Q1;2010
The use of networked organisational arrangements to conduct exchanges is one of the most distinctive features of high-tech research-intensive industries. Advances in biotechnology and genomics research have enabled a generic technology platform that has fuelled a more 'open' approach to innovation and learning. This relies on collaborations between networked partners and allows for the convergence and reorientation of traditional sectors. This paper lends support to the view that some technologies can trigger a higher system level innovation, that is, in addition to the inter-firm level, an inter-industrial and inter-institutional level convergence and re-orientation process. This paper explores how this phenomenon is being witnessed in the pharmaceutical and food sectors and fast becoming a dominant logic in the emerging nutraceuticals industry.;3;Business;Ref668;Q2;2010
Open innovation is increasingly popular among practitioners and scholars, but its implications for public policy making have not yet been analysed in detail. This paper explores a theoretical framework to structure the debate about public policy making that facilitates open innovation. We first define open innovation in terms of firms' open innovation practices and external conditions that encourage enterprises to practice open innovation. We show that policies for open innovation are legitimate as traditional arguments like market and system failures continue to apply. Next, we identify several guidelines for policymaking. Rather than just offering RD and interaction-oriented policies, we conclude that open innovation warrants attention in a broader range of policy areas, including entrepreneurship, education, science, labour markets and competition. Developing truly horizontal policies is a major challenge to facilitate open innovation in developed economies.;3;Business;Ref669;Q2;2010
"A recession often forces you to cut R&D as you refocus on your core. But innovation need not go by the wayside. By placing certain assets and projects outside your walls, you can actually preserve opportunities for future growth while you shore up the fortress. Chesbrough, of Haas School of Business, and Garman, of New Venture Partners, identify five strategic moves that open the door to innovation by, ironically, letting it out of the house. Some inside-out moves permit outside firms to invest in and develop your projects; others call for spinning off projects as separate ventures that still allow you to retain some equity. Whatever the specific approach, you can meet the inherent cultural and organizational challenges of inside-out open innovation by approaching it holistically and placing it under the leadership of senior executives in strategic roles.";3;Business;Ref670;Q2;2009
P>We merge research into knowledge management, absorptive capacity, and dynamic capabilities to arrive at an integrative perspective, which considers knowledge exploration, retention, and exploitation inside and outside a firm's boundaries. By complementing the concept of absorptive capacity, we advance towards a capability-based framework for open innovation processes. We identify the following six 'knowledge capacities' as a firm's critical capabilities of managing internal and external knowledge in open innovation processes: inventive, absorptive, transformative, connective, innovative, and desorptive capacity. 'Knowledge management capacity' is a dynamic capability, which reconfigures and realigns the knowledge capacities. It refers to a firm's ability to successfully manage its knowledge base over time. The concept may be regarded as a framework for open innovation, as a complement to absorptive capacity, and as a move towards understanding dynamic capabilities for managing knowledge. On this basis, it contributes to explaining interfirm heterogeneity in knowledge and alliance strategies, organizational boundaries, and innovation performance.;3;Business;Ref671;Q1;2009

There is currently a broad awareness of open innovation and its relevance to corporate R&D. The implications and trends that underpin open innovation are actively discussed in terms of strategic, organizational, behavioral, knowledge, legal and business perspectives, and its economic implications. This special issue aims to advance the R&D, innovation, and technology management perspective by building on past and present studies in the field and providing future directions. Recent research, including the papers in this special issue, demonstrates an increasing range of situations where the concept is regarded as applicable. Most research to date has followed the outside-in process of open innovation, while the inside-out process remains less explored. A third coupled process of open innovation is also attracting significant research attention. These different processes show why it is necessary to have a full understanding of how and where open innovation can add value in knowledge-intensive processes. There may be a need for a creative interpretation and adaptation of the value propositions, or business models, in each situation. In other words, there are important implications for new and emerging methods of R&D management.;3;Business;Ref673;Q1;2009
Firms may open up their innovation processes on two dimensions. While inbound open innovation refers to the acquisition of external technology in open exploration processes, outbound open innovation describes the outward transfer of technology in open exploitation processes. Prior open innovation research has focused on the inbound dimension, whereas the outbound dimension has been relatively neglected. Therefore, this article addresses the relationship between outbound open R&D strategies and firm performance. We use data from 136 industrial firms to test four hypotheses on the moderating effects of environmental factors in the relationship between open innovation strategies and firm performance. The results show that the degree of technological turbulence, the transaction rate in technology markets, and the competitive intensity in technology markets strengthen the positive effects of outbound open innovation on firm performance. By contrast, the degree of patent protection does not facilitate successful open innovation. The results are crucially important to managers because they show under what environmental conditions open innovation strategies enhance performance.;3;Business;Ref674;Q1;2009
Extant research on open innovation (OI) offers no systematic insight of how and why firms differ regarding the extent to which they conduct OI activities. Whereas past theoretical contributions have focused on explaining the externalisation of R&D activities as a result of firm-external factors, we focus on explaining this externalisation as a result of firm-internal weaknesses, specifically, impediments to innovation. Using the exploration-exploitation dichotomy as our theoretical framework, we develop hypotheses on how impediments to innovation influence the breadth and depth of OI. We then test these hypotheses by using an exceptionally large and detailed data set to estimate population-averaged panel models. Our results provide support for most of the hypothesised relationships. Further, they allow to identify four 'archetypes' of firms that differ significantly regarding the breadth and depth of OI and the importance of impediments. Finally, we discuss the significance of these findings for both academics and managers.;3;Business;Ref675;Q1;2009
Research on Open Innovation has increasingly emphasised the role of communities in creating, shaping and disseminating innovations. However, the comparability of many studies has been hampered by the lack of a precise definition of the community construct, and the research on Open Innovation has to date not been well connected to insights from research on the role of transformational leaders and the networking of champions and promotors across organisational boundaries. For this reason, this paper introduces a new construct of 'innovation communities' based on promotor theory, which it defines as 'networks of promotors'. It proposes a comprehensive concept of the quality of interaction in innovation communities, and presents findings of three case studies, which explore the role of promotors and networks of promotors in Open Innovation. The case studies reveal that such transformational leaders as promotors, and especially their close and informal co-operation across functional and organisational boundaries, play a key role in Open Innovation.;3;Business;Ref676;Q1;2009
At present, several virtual initiatives claim to be acting according to the open source software (OSS) arena, which is often deemed a role model for open innovation. Against this background, this research focuses on a comparative case study of two non-profit project networks that attempt to operate in line with the OSS phenomenon: Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia, and the development of an automobile, Open Source car. We show that many parallels to the OSS arena can be drawn in both cases. However, this analysis must be performed cautiously, as several factors limit the applicability of OSS principles to non-software-related arenas. We conclude with a discussion of implications for open innovation research and managerial practice.;3;Business;Ref677;Q1;2009
"This paper examines the concept of open innovation within the context of corporate social responsibility. It demonstrates how the practice of open innovation unfolds in inter-organizational collaborations that involve the voluntary or charitable sector, outlining the findings of an explorative collective case study of eight voluntary dyadic partnerships between corporate and nonprofit organizations in the United Kingdom, which have resulted in innovation outcomes. Two generic approaches to open innovation were witnessed: firstly, a more exploratory approach to dyadic engagement activities that resulted in an emergent innovation process, and secondly, a focused and pre-determined search activity to exploit the resources of the nonprofit partner that demonstrated a more planned innovation process. Two distinct boundary-spanning roles were identified: in dyads exhibiting few organizational linkages, the role was associated with formal responsibilities from senior management to 'manage' innovation opportunities and outcomes. In dyads exhibiting high linkages, there was no such formality; the role was a 'conduit' to facilitate search and exploration to locate opportunities for innovation through idea exchange. Overall, this research demonstrates the value of an open innovation approach driven by the need to address societal and social issues (rather than those purely economic). Such practice broadens a firm's 'search' activities and delivers innovations in exchange for enhanced social legitimacy - acting innovation capital for future enterprising activities and market advantage.";3;Business;Ref678;Q1;2009
When, on 21st September 2006, 'The Economist' compared incumbent telecommunication operators with dinosaurs that could soon face extinction, most readers were ready to agree. The mixture of declining revenues and fierce competition was believed to shake the market and soon to dethrone former national champions. However, there are ways to fight that extinction and one way is to open up for competitive advantage. This paper reflects on a case study at Deutsche Telekom, the German national telecommunication operator. The aim of this study is to analyse to what extent the open innovation paradigm has been embraced inside this now multinational company. Using empirical evidence from 15 in-depth interviews, we identify 11 open innovation instruments and detail their value contribution. We can show that Deutsche Telekom has successfully enhanced its innovation capacity by opening up its traditional development process and embracing external creativity and knowledge resources.;3;Business;Ref679;Q1;2009
Open innovation has so far been studied mainly in high-tech, Multinational enterprises. This exploratory paper investigates if open innovation practices are also applied by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Drawing oil I database collected from 605 innovative SMEs in the Netherlands, we explore the incidence of and apparent trend towards open innovation. The survey furthermore focuses oil the motives and perceived challenges when SMEs adopt open innovation practices. Within the survey, open innovation is measured with eight innovation practices reflecting technology exploration and exploitation in SMEs. We find that the responding SMEs engage in many open innovation practices and have increasingly adopted such practices during the past 7 years. In addition. we find no major differences between manufacturing and services industries, but medium-sized firms are oil average more heavily involved in open innovation than their smaller counterparts. We furthermore find that SMEs Pursue open innovation primarily for market-related motives such as meeting customer demands, or keeping LIP with competitors. Their most important challenges relate to organizational and Cultural issues as a consequence of dealing with increased external contacts. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

"Purpose This paper aims to explore the ways in which firms utilise hierarchical relationships and the market system to supply and acquire intellectual property (IP) and/or innovation capabilities from sources external to the firm. Design/methodology/approach The authors conduct. a field study to explore emerging governance structures for open innovation, using multiple data sources including documents (e.g. white papers) and interviews published by the firms studied, analysis of the firms' web-based systems (where applicable), secondary content (e.g. news articles) and elite interviews with key personnel. Findings The analysis of seven exemplars of open innovation reveals that inter-organisational relationships that facilitate open innovation can be categorised based on whether they are mediated or direct, and seek to exchange intellectual property or innovation capability. Using this categorisation, the authors present an analysis that reveals four governance structures along ten dimensions, and discuss the influence of knowledge dispersion, uncertainty and transaction costs on the emergence of such structures. The authors conclude that the appropriateness of hierarchical/market relationships or intermediaries to source IP and/or innovation capability is dependent on the information asymmetry in relation to the existence and availability of potential solutions/solvers; the suitability of potential innovation partners (solution providers and solvers); and the acquisition process for external innovations (including problem specification, solution evaluation, transfer, etc.). Research limitations/implications The research is exploratory in nature, and designed to serve as a foundation for future research efforts. In particular, the work highlights the need for research that takes an inter-organisational perspective on facilitating open innovation. Practical implications - The research highlights the prominence of information asymmetry as a key issue in choosing and designing appropriate governance structures for open innovation. Originality/value The paper presents an exploratory study of an emerging, and consequently under-researched phenomenon.";13;Information;Ref681;Q1;2009
Purpose - The purpose of the paper is to introduce standardization as a neutral arena for open innovation. The aim is to show that different policies towards open membership in standardization initiatives lead to different open innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach - Two cases are used to illustrate the differences in open innovation processes. The cases are the Android mobile operating system and the service platform developed by the Open Mobile Alliance. The core process types introduced by Gassmann and Enkel are used to show the different open innovation approaches. Findings - Both cases use open innovation to create standards. Open membership leads to a coupled process, while a more restricted membership gives separate inside-out and outside-in processes. The case lead by established firms in the industry has a process where radical innovations are introduced early in the process, while the case lead by newcomers has a process where radical innovations are introduced late in the process. The two cases have different approaches towards commercialization of the products. Android relies on third-party developers, while the Open Mobile Alliance relies on their own members. Research limitations/implications - The cases are from the telecommunication sector and based on standardization of large technical platforms. The findings might not be the same for other sectors. Originality/value - The paper establishes open innovation as a neutral arena for open innovation outside the domain of any single firm. It shows how the openness towards membership influences the choice of open innovation processes.;13;Information;Ref682;Q1;2009
"Increasing adoption of open innovation as an alternative route to research and development necessitates the development of new ways to organize innovation, as well as reassessment of existing ways. Much like traditional corporations that subscribe to the closed innovation paradigm, novel organizational arrangements targeting open innovation, such as small-firm networks, employ boards to effectively manage joint research-and-development activities. These boards are similar yet different from traditional corporate boards; as such, they may have different requirements for proper functioning. We use 5-year longitudinal data on 53 Swedish strategic small-firm networks to investigate how the boards should be organized to help improve the innovative status of network participants. We expand the set of tools available for effective organization of the boards' operations and emphasize the effects of network board continuity (rates of renewal) on network members' innovative performance. We argue that the relationship is curvilinear (U-shaped) and demonstrate that it is more pronounced in larger networks.";3;Business;Ref683;Q1;2009
In an innovation contest, a firm (the seeker) facing an innovation-related problem (e. g., a technical R&D problem) posts this problem to a population of independent agents (the solvers) and then provides an award to the agent that generated the best solution. In this paper, we analyze the interaction between a seeker and a set of solvers. Prior research in economics suggests that having many solvers work on an innovation problem will lead to a lower equilibrium effort for each solver, which is undesirable from the perspective of the seeker. In contrast, we establish that the seeker can benefit from a larger solver population because he obtains a more diverse set of solutions, which mitigates and sometimes outweighs the effect of the solvers' underinvestment in effort. We demonstrate that the inefficiency of the innovation contest resulting from the solvers' underinvestment can further be reduced by changing the award structure from a fixed-price award to a performance-contingent award. Finally, we compare the quality of the solutions and seeker profits with the case of an internal innovation process. This allows us to predict which types of products and which cost structures will be the most likely to benefit from the contest approach to innovation.;3;Business;Ref684;Q1;2008
This study addresses open innovation in the telecommunications industry and the relationship between technological convergence and open innovation. Specifically, the study focuses on the increasingly widespread trend of mobile companies to engage in external capabilities and knowledge sources as a way to extend their knowledge boundaries. Collaboration efforts have strongly impacted open innovation strategies as the external environment is constantly changing, particularly in digital convergence and standards networks. The authors confirm that exploitation-oriented alliances play a key role in the paradigm shift by using the number of U.S. co-patents to prove the strong, collaborative research of leading mobile firms (Nokia, Motorola, Samsung and LG). They also confirm that current industry leaders have relatively high cross-country patents, indicating international research and development (R&D) efforts with increasing strategic alliance activity. Foreign inventors and strategic alliances are therefore increasing.;3;Business;Ref685;Q3;2008
In the context of open innovation, firms increasingly acquire technologies from external sources. Moreover, many firms have recently started to actively commercialize technologies, for example, by means of outlicensing. While some pioneering firms realize enormous benefits from this, many others experience major difficulties in managing external technology exploitation. To overcome these challenges, firms need to establish appropriate strategic technology-planning processes. Such processes include the extension of product-technology roadmapping to integrated roadmaps for open innovation processes, including external technology exploitation. This has a number of implications for technology managers, including the need to consider potential returns from a technology as a whole rather than from product sales alone.;3;Business;Ref686;Q1;2008
In addition to acquiring external technology, firms have started to actively commercialize technological knowledge, which represents the opposite type of technology transactions. The strong interactions with a, firm's environment contrast the traditional closed approaches to innovation. Therefore, this new paradigm has been termed open innovation. Prior research into this field has mostly been limited to theoretical considerations and case studies. More general Work has usually focused either on external technology acquisition or on external technology exploitation. Accordingly, I take an integrated perspective and regard the two types of technology transactions as the main dimensions of a firm's strategic approach to open innovation. Drawing on these dimensions, I use data from a questionnaire-based study of 154 middle and large companies to identify groups of firms that pursue homogeneous strategies regarding open innovation. Accordingly, this analysis is the first large-scale study that describes the current state of open innovation in practice. Moreover, it is the first work that identifies strategic approaches of firms to technology transactions along the innovation process.;3;Business;Ref687;Q1;2008
Research on open source software, user innovation and open innovation have increasingly emphasized the role of communities in creating, shaping and disseminating innovations.

Teirlinck P. and Spithoven A. The spatial organization of innovation: open innovation, external knowledge relations and urban structure, Regional Studies. The increased use of external knowledge relations, complementary to in-house research and development, influences the way firms are organized to manage innovation. The 'new' imperative of open innovation promotes the idea that firms organize innovation, to a greater extent, in interaction with outside parties. This paper argues that both the organization of innovation as well as the use of external knowledge depends on the physical, socio-economic and cultural environment. The outcome of the analysis supports the idea that (open) innovation is spatially organized. Contrary to the expectations, innovative firms in less urbanized areas show a higher degree of openness.;3;Business;Ref689;Q1;2008
The increasing adoption of more open approaches to innovation fits uneasily with current theories of business strategy. Traditional business strategy has guided firms to develop defensible positions against the forces of competition and power in the value chain, implying the importance of constructing barriers rather than promoting value creation through openness. Recently, however, firms and even whole industries, such as the software industry, are experimenting with novel business models based on harnessing collective creativity through open innovation. The apparent success of some of these experiments challenges prevailing views of strategy. At the same time, many of these experimenters now are grappling with issues related to value capture and sustainability of their business models, as well as issues of corporate influence and the potential co-option of open initiatives. These issues bring us back to traditional business strategy, which can offer important insights. To make strategic sense of innovation communities, ecosystems, networks, and their implications for competitive advantage, a new approach to strategy open strategy-is needed. Open strategy balances the tenets of traditional business strategy with the promise of open innovation.;3;Business;Ref690;Q1;2007
W hat types of human and social capital identify the emergence of leaders of open innovation communities? Consistent with the norms of an engineering culture, we find that future leaders must first make strong technical contributions. Beyond technical contributions, they must then integrate their communities in order to mobilize volunteers and avoid the ever-present danger of forking and batkanization. This is enabled by two correlated but distinct social positions: social brokerage and boundary spanning between technological areas. An inherent lack of trust associated with brokerage positions can be overcome through physical interaction. Boundary spanners do not suffer this handicap and are much more likely than brokers to advance to leadership. The research separates the influence of human and social capital on promotion, and highlights previously unexamined differences between brokerage- and boundary-spanning positions. Longitudinal analyses of careers within the Internet Engineering Task Force community from 1986-2002 support the arguments.;3;Business;Ref691;Q1;2007
This paper provides a quantitative study (N = 268) of patterns of free revealing of firm-developed innovations within embedded Linux, a type of open source software (OSS). I find that firms, without being obliged to do so, contribute many of their own developments back to public embedded Linux code, eliciting and indeed receiving informal development support from other firms. That is, they perform a part of their product development open to the public-an unthinkable idea for traditionally minded managers. Such openness obviously entails the challenge of protecting one's intellectual property. I find that firms address this issue by revealing selectively. They reveal, on average, about half of the code they have developed, while protecting the other half by various means. Revealing is strongly heterogeneous among firms. Multivariate analysis can partly explain this heterogeneity by firm characteristics and the firm's purpose behind revealing. An analysis of reasons for revealing and of the type of revealed code shows that different types of firms have different rationales for openness. Implications for management are that the conflict between downsides and benefits of openness appears manageable. Provided selective revealing is practiced deliberately, the opportunities of open development dominate. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;3;Business;Ref692;Q1;2006
Companies have historically invested in large research and development departments to drive innovation and provide sustainable growth. This model, however, is eroding due to a number of factors. What is emerging is a more open model, where companies recognize that not all good ideas will come from inside the organization and not all good ideas created within the organization can be successfully marketed internally. To date, Open Innovation concepts have been regarded as relevant primarily to 'high-technology' industries, with examples that include Lucent, 3Com, IBM, Intel and Millenium Pharmaceuticals. In this article, we identify organizations in industries outside 'high technology' that are early adopters of the concept. Our findings demonstrate that many Open Innovation concepts are already in use in a wide range of industries. We document practices that appear to assist organizations adopting these concepts, and discover that Open Innovation is not ipso facto a recipe for outsourcing R&D. We conclude that Open Innovation has utility as a paradigm for industrial innovation beyond high tech to more traditional and mature industries.;3;Business;Ref693;Q1;2006
Open innovation is a powerful framework encompassing the generation, capture, and employment of intellectual property at the firm level. We identify three fundamental challenges for firms in applying the concept of open innovation: finding creative ways to exploit internal innovation, incorporating external innovation into internal development, and motivating outsiders to supply an ongoing stream of external innovations. This latter challenge involves a paradox, why would firms spend money on R&D efforts if the results of these efforts are available to rival firms? To explore these challenges, we examine the activity of firms in open-source software to support their innovation strategies. Firms involved in open-source software often make investments that will be shared with real and potential rivals. We identify four strategies firms employ - pooled R&D/product development, spinouts, selling complements and attracting donated complements - and discuss how they address the three key challenges of open innovation. We conclude with suggestions for how similar strategies may apply in other industries and offer some possible avenues for future research on open innovation.;3;Business;Ref694;Q1;2006
As with all new ideas, the concept of Open Innovation requires extensive empirical investigation, testing and development. This paper analyzes Procter and Gamble's 'Connect and Develop' strategy as a case study of the major organizational and technological changes associated with open innovation. It argues that although some of the organizational changes accompanying open innovation are beginning to be described in the literature, more analysis is warranted into the ways technological changes have facilitated open innovation strategies, particularly related to new product development. Information and communications technologies enable the exchange of distributed sources of information in the open innovation process. The case study shows that furthermore a suite of new technologies for data mining, simulation, prototyping and visual representation, what we call 'innovation technology', help to support open innovation in Procter and Gamble. The paper concludes with a suggested research agenda for furthering understanding of the role played by and consequences of this technology.;3;Business;Ref695;Q1;2006
"In the increasingy competitive landscape, there is a growing demand for companies to be innovative. However, the concept of innovation is confounded by the central question of what makes a product innovative. If innovation is defined as the commercialization of an enabling technology that provides the customer with new capability, then there are two key requisites for innovation: customer insight to identify unmet need, and technology awareness to identify the respective enabling technology. Drivers for innovation can be thought of as any,force that links customer need uniquely with an enabling technology solution; this region of overlap is described as the innovation space. Roche Diagnostics manages the challenges of sourcing external technologies by leveraging these drivers through comprehensive technology evaluation.";3;Business;Ref696;Q1;2006
An important and intriguing aspect of c-entrepreneurship is the formation of new ventures in the domain of open source software (OSS). Previous research on these ventures has primarily looked at the design of business models. The purpose of this paper is to explore how three key challenges of venture management - the liabilities of newness and smallness of start-ups and market entry barriers - affect new ventures in OSS. Based on empirical data from personal interviews and a large scale survey, we find that several liabilities that are typically discussed in the entrepreneurship literature are much less of a challenge for new ventures in OSS. Our findings have implications for the emerging theory on e-entrepreneurship and for entrepreneurs considering to exploit business opportunities based on OSS and on open innovation in general.;8;Engineering;Ref697;Q1;2006
This paper addresses how the Open Innovation concept, as recently coined by Henry Chesbrough, can be analyzed from an industrial dynamics perspective. The main proposition of the paper is that the specific modes in which different companies manage Open Innovation in regard to an emerging technology reflect their differential position within the innovation system in question, the nature and stage of maturity of the technological regime, and the particular value proposition pursued by companies. The proposition is analyzed through an in-depth study of the cut-rent transformation of sound amplification from linear solid state technology to switched or digital technology within the consumer electronics system of innovation. The analysis especially addresses the complex interplay between technology entrepreneurs and incumbents, and demonstrates that Open Innovation sometimes has to be conducted under conditions of high transaction costs.

This paper proposes to review and assess social scientific debate about the origins and nature of innovation in modem society. It focuses on three sub-sets of conceptualisation, critique and commentary that refer specifically to sub-national or regional innovation systems. Research in the latter field has grown enormously in recent years. Moreover, new perspectives from other disciplines than regional science have been promoted. One distinctive view of relevance in that it is focused on the role in innovation of specific 'entrepreneurial universities' in relation to industry and government is, of course, the 'Triple Helix' approach. This is reviewed and sympathetically critiqued. A second view, less sympathetically critiqued here, is one that itself attacks all so-called 'new regionalism' for stressing the importance of institutions, industry embeddedness and the micro-science of regional economic development. Dazzled by 'Globalisation 1' and the totalising power of 'scale' geographies, this rejection of the worth of spatial analysis at less than the global or national 'scalar envelope' is assessed for its potential insights into weaknesses of the regional innovation systems approach but found wanting in both technical accuracy and scholarly competence. Finally, the state of the art in regional innovation systems research is sketched by reference both to recent longitudinal findings and elaborations into specific technological fields, particularly but not only Bioregional Innovation Systems that help move us towards a newer theory of economic geography in the knowledge economy, based on 'regional knowledge capabilities.' The analysis conclusively proposes 'Globalisation 2', a 'ground-up' knowledge-driven evolution of the earlier 'top-down' multilateral trade institution and corporately driven 'Globalisation 1.'

By combining internal and external competencies and knowledge, both in R&D and marketing, the multinational life sciences and performance materials company DSM is opening up its innovation process. DSM recognizes that successful, profitable innovation depends upon teamwork and an entrepreneurial culture. The presence of a business group dedicated to business development and venturing testifies to the increased importance of speeding up innovation at DSM, using both internal and external leads at all stages of new business development. During this process, different management styles are required, ranging from a scientific approach in the early stages, to an entrepreneurial attitude in the early phase of commercialization, to a more risk-adverse mindset once the business has matured. As DSM understands it, innovation is a culture, not a process.;3;Business;Ref700;Q1;2005
"Industrial innovation is becoming more open, requiring changes in how firms manage innovation. External sources of knowledge become more prominent, while external channels to market also of,fer greater promise. This complicates the evaluation of early-stage technology projects, which often involve significant technical and market uncertainty. In such circumstances, companies need to ""play poker"" as well as chess. Measurement errors (false positives, false negatives) are likely to arise from judgments about the commercial potential of early-stage projects. Most companies' policies consciously limit ""false positives"" in assessing a project's commercial potential, but few companies take steps to manage the risk of ""false negatives."" New metrics may help a firm focus more upon external sources of innovation to enhance its business model, and enable the firm to salvage value from false negatives that otherwise would be lost.";3;Business;Ref701;Q1;2004
Companies have traditionally managed innovation as an internal process, relying upon their own skills and capabilities. However, this closed approach to innovation is no longer viable in a period of rapid diffusion of commercially valuable knowledge. If leading firms are to retain their capacity for innovation, they must begin to manage intellectual property via the logic of open innovation. Such an approach is much more fluid., emphasizing both the use of R&D produced outside the firm and the development of internal systems to reward commercially viable innovation within the firm.;3;Business;Ref702;Q1;2003
Companies are increasingly rethinking the fundamental ways in which they generate ideas and bring them to market - harnessing external ideas while leveraging their in-house R&D outside their current operations.;3;Business;Ref703;Q1;2003
